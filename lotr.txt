this tale grew in the telling until it became a history of the great war of
the ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that
preceded it it was begun soon after the hobbit was written and before
its publication in 1937 but i did not go on with this sequel for i wished
first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the elder days
which had then been taking shape for some years i desired to do this for my own
satisfaction and i had little hope that other people would be interested in
this work especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was
begun in order to provide the necessary background of history for elvish
tongues
when those whose advice and opinion i sought corrected little hope to no
hope i went back to the sequel encouraged by requests from readers for
more information concerning hobbits and their adventures but the story was
drawn irresistibly towards the older world and became an account as it were
of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told the
process had begun in the writing of the hobbit in which there were
already some references to the older matter elrond gondolin the high elves
and the orcs as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or
deeper or darker than its surface durin moria gandalf the necromancer the
ring the discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation
to the ancient histories revealed the third age and its culmination in the war
of the ring
those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it but
they had to wait a long time for the composition of the lord of the rings went
on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949 a period in which i had many
duties that i did not neglect and many other interests as a learner and teacher
that often absorbed me the delay was of course also increased by the outbreak
of war in 1939 by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of
book one in spite of the darkness of the next five years i found that the story
could not now be wholly abandoned and i plodded on mostly by night till i
stood by balins tomb in moria there i halted for a long while it was almost a
year later when i went on and so came to lothlórien and the great river
late in 1941 in the next year i wrote the first drafts of the matter that now
stands as book three and the beginnings of chapters i and iii of book five and
there as the beacons flared in anórien and théoden came to
harrowdale i stopped foresight had failed and there was no time for thought
it was during 1944 that leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war
which it was my task to conduct or at least to report i forced myself to
tackle the journey of frodo to mordor these chapters eventually to become book
four were written and sent out as a serial to my son christopher then in
south africa with the raf nonetheless it took another five years before the
tale was brought to its present end in that time i changed my house my chair
and my college and the days though less dark were no less laborious then when
the end had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised and indeed
largely re written backwards and it had to be typed and re typed by me the
cost of professional typing by the ten fingered was beyond my means
the lord of the rings
as for any inner meaning or message it has in the intention of the author
none it is neither allegorical nor topical as the story grew it put down roots
into the past and threw out unexpected branches but its main theme was
settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the ring as the link between
it and the hobbit the crucial chapter the shadow of the past is
one of the oldest parts of the tale it was written long before the foreshadow
of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster and from that point the
story would have developed along essentially the same lines if that disaster
had been averted its sources are things long before in mind or in some cases
already written and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began
in 1939 or its sequels
the real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its
conclusion if it had inspired or directed the development of the legend then
certainly the ring would have been seized and used against sauron he would not
have been annihilated but enslaved and barad dûr would not have been
destroyed but occupied saruman failing to get possession of the ring would in
the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in mordor the missing links
in his own researches into ring lore and before long he would have made a great
ring of his own with which to challenge the self styled ruler of middle earth
in that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt they
would not long have survived even as slaves
other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those
who like allegory or topical reference but i cordially dislike allegory in all
its manifestations and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to
detect its presence i much prefer history true or feigned with its varied
applicability to the thought and experience of readers i think that many
confuse applicability with allegory but the one resides in the freedom of
the reader and the other in the purposed domination of the author
an author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience but
the ways in which a story germ uses the soil of experience are extremely
complex and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from evidence
that is inadequate and ambiguous it is also false though naturally attractive
when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped to suppose that the
movements of thought or the events of times common to both were necessarily the
most powerful influences one has indeed personally to come under the shadow of
war to feel fully its oppression but as the years go by it seems now often
forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience
than to be involved in 1939 and the following years by 1918 all but one of my
close friends were dead or to take a less grievous matter it has been supposed
by some that the scouring of the shire reflects the situation in england at
the time when i was finishing my tale it does not it is an essential part of
the plot foreseen from the outset though in the event modified by the
character of saruman as developed in the story without need i say any
allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever it has
indeed some basis in experience though slender for the economic situation was
entirely different and much further back the country in which i lived in
childhood was being shabbily destroyed before i was ten in days when motor cars
were rare objects i had never seen one and men were still building suburban
railways recently i saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the
once thriving corn mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important
i never liked the looks of the young miller but his father the old miller had
a black beard and he was not named sandyman
the lord of the rings
 
 
 
this book is largely concerned with hobbits and from its pages a reader may
discover much of their character and a little of their history further
information will also be found in the selection from the red book of westmarch
that has already been published under the title of the hobbit that
story was derived from the earlier chapters of the red book composed by bilbo
himself the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large and called by
him there and back again since they told of his journey into the east
and his return an adventure which later involved all the hobbits in the great
events of that age that are here related
many however may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the
outset while some may not possess the earlier book for such readers a few
notes on the more important points are here collected from hobbit lore and the
first adventure is briefly recalled
hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people more numerous formerly
than they are today for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth a
well ordered and well farmed countryside was their favourite haunt they do not
and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forge bellows a
water mill or a hand loom though they were skilful with tools even in ancient
days they were as a rule shy of the big folk as they call us and now they
avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find they are quick of hearing
and sharp eyed and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry
unnecessarily they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements they
possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently when
large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by and this an they
have developed until to men it may seem magical but hobbits have never in
fact studied magic of any kind and their elusiveness is due solely to a
professional skill that heredity and practice and a close friendship with the
earth have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races
for they are a little people smaller than dwarves less tout and stocky
that is even when they are not actually much shorter their height is variable
ranging between two and four feet of our measure they seldom now reach three
feet but they hive dwindled they say and in ancient days they were taller
according to the red book bandobras took bullroarer son of isengrim the
second was four foot five and able to ride a horse he was surpassed in all
hobbit records only by two famous characters of old but that curious matter is
dealt with in this book
as for the hobbits of the shire with whom these tales are concerned in the
days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk they dressed in
bright colours being notably fond of yellow and green but they seldom wore
shoes since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick
curling hair much like the hair of their heads which was commonly brown thus
the only craft little practised among them was shoe making but they had long
and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things their
faces were as a rule good natured rather than beautiful broad bright eyed
red cheeked with mouths apt to laughter and to eating and drinking and laugh
they did and eat and drink often and heartily being fond of simple jests at
all times and of six meals a day when they could get them they were
hospitable and delighted in parties and in presents which they gave away
freely and eagerly accepted
it is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement hobbits are relatives
of ours far nearer to us than elves or even than dwarves of old they spoke
the languages of men after their own fashion and liked and disliked much the
same things as men did but what exactly our relationship is can no longer be
discovered the beginning of hobbits lies far back in the elder days that are
now lost and forgotten only the elves still preserve any records of that
vanished time and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own
history in which men appear seldom and hobbits are not mentioned at all yet it
is clear that hobbits had in fact lived quietly in middle earth for many long
years before other folk became even aware of them and the world being after all
full of strange creatures beyond count these little people seemed of very
little importance but in the days of bilbo and of frodo his heir they
suddenly became by no wish of their own both important and renowned and
troubled the counsels of the wise and the great
those days the third age of middle earth are now long past and the shape
of all lands has been changed but the regions in which hobbits then lived were
doubtless the same as those in which they still linger the north west of the
old world east of the sea of their original home the hobbits in bilbos time
preserved no knowledge a love of learning other than genealogical lore was
far from general among them but there remained still a few in the older
families who studied their own books and even gathered reports of old times and
distant lands from elves dwarves and men their own records began only after
the settlement of the shire and their most ancient legends hardly looked
further back than their wandering days it is clear nonetheless from these
legends and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs that like
many other folk hobbits had in the distant past moved westward their earliest
tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of anduin
between the eaves of greenwood the great and the misty mountains why they later
undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into eriador is no
longer certain their own accounts speak of the multiplying of men in the land
and of a shadow that fell on the forest so that it became darkened and its new
name was mirkwood
before the crossing of the mountains the hobbits had already become divided
into three somewhat different breeds harfoots stoors and fallohides the
harfoots were browner of skin smaller and shorter and they were beardless and
bootless their hands and feet were neat and nimble and they preferred
highlands and hillsides the stoors were broader heavier in build their feet
and hands were larger and they preferred flat lands and riversides the
fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair and they were taller and
slimmer than the others they were lovers of trees and of woodlands
the harfoots had much to do with dwarves in ancient times and long lived in
the foothills of the mountains they moved westward early and roamed over
eriador as far as weathertop while the others were still in the wilderland they
were the most normal and representative variety of hobbit and far the most
numerous they were the most inclined to settle in one place and longest
preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes
the stoors lingered long by the banks of the great river anduin and were
less shy of men they came west after the harfoots and followed the course of
the loudwater southwards and there many of them long dwelt between tharbad and
the borders of dunland before they moved north again
the fallohides the least numerous were a northerly branch they were more
friendly with elves than the other hobbits were and had more skill in language
and song than in handicrafts and of old they preferred hunting to tilling they
crossed the mountains north of rivendell and came down the river hoarwell in
eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them but being
somewhat bolder and more adventurous they were often found as leaders or
chieftains among clans of harfoots or stoors even in bilbos time the strong
fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater families such as the
tooks and the masters of buckland
in the westlands of eriador between the misty mountains and the mountains of
lune the hobbits found both men and elves indeed a remnant still dwelt there
of the dúnedain the kings of men that came over the sea out of
westernesse but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their north kingdom
were falling far and wide into waste there was room and to spare for incomers
and ere long the hobbits began to settle in ordered communities most of their
earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in bilbos time but
one of the first to become important still endured though reduced in size this
was at bree and in the chetwood that lay round about some forty miles east of
the shire
it was in these early days doubtless that the hobbits learned their letters
and began to write after the manner of the dúnedain who had in their
turn long before learned the art from the elves and in those days also they
forgot whatever languages they had used before and spoke ever after the common
speech the westron as it was named that was current through all the lands of
the kings from arnor to gondor and about all the coasts of the sea from
belfalas to lune yet they kept a few words of their own as well as their own
names of months and days and a great store of personal names out of the past
about this time legend among the hobbits first becomes history with a
reckoning of years for it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of
the third age that the fallohide brothers marcho and blanco set out from bree
and having obtained permission from the high king at fornost they crossed the
brown river baranduin with a great following of hobbits they passed over the
bridge of stonebows that had been built in the days of the power of the north
kingdom and they took ail the land beyond to dwell in between the river and
the far downs all that was demanded of them was that they should keep the great
bridge in repair and all other bridges and roads speed the kings messengers
and acknowledge his lordship
thus began the shire reckoning for the year of the crossing of the
brandywine as the hobbits turned the name became year one of the shire and
all later dates were reckoned from it at once the western hobbits fell in love
with their new land and they remained there and soon passed once more out of
the history of men and of elves while there was still a king they were in name
his subjects but they were in fact ruled by their own chieftains and meddled
not at all with events in the world outside to the last battle at fornost with
the witch lord of angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king or so
they maintained though no tales of men record it but in that war the north
kingdom ended and then the hobbits took the land for their own and they chose
from their own chiefs a thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone
there for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars and they prospered
and multiplied after the dark plague sr 37 until the disaster of the long
winter and the famine that followed it many thousands then perished but the
days of dearth 1158 60 were at the time of this tale long past and the hobbits
had again become accustomed to plenty the land was rich and kindly and though
it had long been deserted when they entered it it had before been well tilled
and there the king had once had many farms cornlands vineyards and woods
forty leagues it stretched from the far downs to the brandywine bridge and
fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south the hobbits named it
the shire as the region of the authority of their thain and a district of
well ordered business and there in that pleasant comer of the world they plied
their well ordered business of living and they heeded less and less the world
outside where dark things moved until they came to think that peace and plenty
were the rule in middle earth and the right of all sensible folk they forgot or
ignored what little they had ever known of the guardians and of the labours of
those that made possible the long peace of the shire they were in fact
sheltered but they had ceased to remember it
at no time had hobbits of any kind been warlike and they had never fought
among themselves in olden days they had of course been often obliged to fight
to maintain themselves in a hard world but in bilbos time that was very
ancient history the last battle before this story opens and indeed the only
one that had ever been fought within the borders of the shire was beyond living
memory the battle of greenfields sr 1147 in which bandobras took routed an
invasion of orcs even the weathers had grown milder and the wolves that had
once come ravening out of the north in bitter white winters were now only a
grandfathers tale so though there was still some store of weapons in the
shire these were used mostly as trophies hanging above hearths or on walls or
gathered into the museum at michel delving the mathom house it was called for
anything that hobbits had no immediate use for but were unwilling to throw
away they called a mathom their dwellings were apt to become rather
crowded with mathoms and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand
were of that sort
nonetheless ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough they
were if it came to it difficult to daunt or to kill and they were perhaps
so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could when put to
it do without them and could survive rough handling by grief foe or weather
in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further
than their bellies and their well fed faces though slow to quarrel and for
sport killing nothing that lived they were doughty at bay and at need could
still handle arms they shot well with the bow for they were keen eyed and sure
at the mark not only with bows and arrows if any hobbit stooped for a stone
it was well to get quickly under cover as all trespassing beasts knew very
well
all hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground or so they believed
and in such dwellings they still felt most at home but in the course of time
they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode actually in the shire in
bilbos days it was as a rule only the richest and the poorest hobbits that
maintained the old custom the poorest went on living in burrows of the most
primitive kind mere holes indeed with only one window or none while the
well to do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of
old but suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels or smials
as they called them were not everywhere to be found and in the flats and the
low lying districts the hobbits as they multiplied began to build above
ground indeed even in the hilly regions and the older villages such as
hobbiton or tuckborough or in the chief township of the shire michel delving
on the white downs there were now many houses of wood brick or stone these
were specially favoured by millers smiths ropers and cartwrights and others
of that sort for even when they had holes to live in hobbits had long been
accustomed to build sheds and workshops
the habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the
inhabitants of the marish down by the brandywine the hobbits of that quarter
the eastfarthing were rather large and heavy legged and they wore dwarf boots
in muddy weather but they were well known to be stoors in a large part of their
blood as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their chins no harfoot
or fallohide had any trace of a beard indeed the folk of the marish and of
buckland east of the river which they afterwards occupied came for the most
part later into the shire up from south away and they still had many peculiar
names and strange words not found elsewhere in the shire
it is probable that the craft of building as many other crafts beside was
derived from the dúnedain but the hobbits may have learned it direct
from the elves the teachers of men in their youth for the elves of the high
kindred had not yet forsaken middle earth and they dwelt still at that time at
the grey havens away to the west and in other places within reach of the shire
three elf towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the tower hills
beyond the western marches they shone far off in the moonlight the tallest was
furthest away standing alone upon a green mound the hobbits of the
westfarthing said that one could see the sea from the lop of that tower but no
hobbit had ever been known to climb it indeed few hobbits had ever seen or
sailed upon the sea and fewer still had ever returned to report it most
hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings and not many
of them could swim and as the days of the shire lengthened they spoke less and
less with the elves and grew afraid of them and distrustful of those that had
dealings with them and the sea became a word of fear among them and a token of
death and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west
the craft of building may have come from elves or men but the hobbits used
it in their own fashion they did not go in for towers their houses were
usually long low and comfortable the oldest kind were indeed no more than
built imitations of smials thatched with dry grass or straw or roofed
with turves and having walls somewhat bulged that stage however belonged to
the early days of the shire and hobbit building had long since been altered
improved by devices learned from dwarves or discovered by themselves a
preference for round windows and even round doors was the chief remaining
peculiarity of hobbit architecture
the houses and the holes of shire hobbits were often large and inhabited by
large families bilbo and frodo baggins were as bachelors very exceptional as
they were also in many other ways such as their friendship with the elves
sometimes as in the case of the tooks of great smials or the brandybucks of
brandy hall many generations of relatives lived in comparative peace together
in one ancestral and many tunnelled mansion all hobbits were in any case
clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care they drew long and
elaborate family trees with innumerable branches in dealing with hobbits it is
important to remember who is related to whom and in what degree it would be
impossible in this book to set out a family tree that included even the more
important members of the more important families at the time which these tales
tell of the genealogical trees at the end of the red book of westmarch are a
small book in themselves and all but hobbits would find them exceedingly dull
hobbits delighted in such things if they were accurate they liked to have
books filled with things that they already knew set out fair and square with no
contradictions
 
there is another astonishing thing about hobbits of old that must be
mentioned an astonishing habit they imbibed or inhaled through pipes of clay
or wood the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb which they called pipe weed
or leaf a variety probably of nicotiana a great deal of mystery
surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom or art as the hobbits preferred
to call it all that could be discovered about it in antiquity was put together
by meriadoc brandybuck later master of buckland and since he and the tobacco
of the southfarthing play a part in the history that follows his remarks in the
introduction to his herblore of the shire may be quoted
 this he says is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own
invention when hobbits first began to smoke is not known all the legends and
family histories take it for granted for ages folk in the shire smoked various
herbs some fouler some sweeter but all accounts agree that tobold hornblower
of longbottom in the southfarthing first grew the true pipe weed in his gardens
in the days of isengrim the second about the year 1070 of shire reckoning the
best home grown still comes from that district especially the varieties now
known as longbottom leaf old toby and southern star
how old toby came by the plant is not recorded for to his dying day he
would not tell he knew much about herbs but he was no traveller it is said
that in his youth he went often to bree though he certainly never went further
from the shire than that it is thus quite possible that he learned of this
plant in bree where now at any rate it grows well on the south slopes of the
hill the bree hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the
pipe weed they claim of course to have done everything before the people of
the shire whom they refer to as colonists but in this case their
claim is i think likely to be true and certainly it was from bree that the
art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries among dwarves and
such other folk rangers wizards or wanderers as still passed to and fro
through that ancient road meeting the home and centre of the an is thus to be
found in the old inn of bree the prancing pony that has been kept by
the family of butterbur from time beyond record
all the same observations that i have made on my own many journeys south
have convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of the world
but came northward from the lower anduin whither it was i suspect originally
brought over sea by the men of westernesse it grows abundantly in gondor and
there is richer and larger than in the north where it is never found wild and
flourishes only in warm sheltered places like longbottom the men of gondor call
it sweet galenas and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers
from that land it must have been carried up the greenway during the long
centuries between the coming of elendil and our own day but even the dúnedain
of gondor allow us this credit hobbits first put it into pipes not even the
wizards first thought of that before we did though one wizard that i knew took
up the art long ago and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he
put his mind to
 
the shire was divided into four quarters the farthings already referred to
north south east and west and these again each into a number of folklands
which still bore the names of some of the old leading families although by the
time of this history these names were no longer found only in their proper
folklands nearly all tooks still lived in the tookland but that was not true
of many other families such as the bagginses or the boffins outside the
farthings were the east and west marches the buckland see beginning of chapter
v book i and the westmarch added to the shire in sr 1462
the shire at this time had hardly any government families for the most
part managed their own affairs growing food and eating it occupied most of
their time in other matters they were as a rule generous and not greedy but
contented and moderate so that estates farms workshops and small trades
tended to remain unchanged for generations
there remained of course the ancient tradition concerning the high king at
fornost or norbury as they called it away north of the shire but there had
been no king for nearly a thousand years and even the ruins of kings norbury
were covered with grass yet the hobbits still said of wild folk and wicked
things such as trolls that they had not heard of the king for they attributed
to the king of old all their essential laws and usually they kept the laws of
free will because they were the rules as they said both ancient and just
it is true that the took family had long been pre eminent for the office of
thain had passed to them from the oldbucks some centuries before and the
chief took had borne that title ever since the thain was the master of the
shire moot and captain of the shire muster and the hobbitry in arms but as
muster and moot were only held in times of emergency which no longer occurred
the thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity the took family was
still indeed accorded a special respect for it remained both numerous and
exceedingly wealthy and was liable to produce in every generation strong
characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperament the latter
qualities however were now rather tolerated in the rich than generally
approved the custom endured nonetheless of referring to the head of the
family as the took and of adding to his name if required a number such as
isengrim the second for instance
the only real official in the shire at this date was the mayor of michel
delving or of the shire who was elected every seven years at the free fair on
the white downs at the lithe that is at midsummer as mayor almost his only
duty was to preside at banquets given on the shire holidays which occurred at
frequent intervals but the offices of postmaster and first shirriff were
attached to the mayoralty so that he managed both the messenger service and the
watch these were the only shire services and the messengers were the most
numerous and much the busier of the two by no means all hobbits were lettered
but those who were wrote constantly to all their friends and a selection of
their relations who lived further off than an afternoons walk
the shirriffs was the name that the hobbits gave to their police or the
nearest equivalent that they possessed they had of course no uniforms such
things being quite unknown only a feather in their caps and they were in
practice rather haywards than policemen more concerned with the strayings of
beasts than of people there were in all the shire only twelve of them three in
each farthing for inside work a rather larger body varying at need was
employed to beat the bounds and to see that outsiders of any kind great or
small did not make themselves a nuisance
at the time when this story begins the bounders as they were called had
been greatly increased there were many reports and complaints of strange
persons and creatures prowling about the borders or over them the first sign
that all was not quite as it should be and always had been except in tales and
legends of long ago few heeded the sign and not even bilbo yet had any notion
of what it portended sixty years had passed since he set out on his memorable
journey and he was old even for hobbits who reached a hundred as often as not
but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought
back how much or how little he revealed to no one not even to frodo his
favourite nephew and he still kept secret the ring that he bad found
 
as is told in the hobbit there came one day to bilbos door the great
wizard gandalf the grey and thirteen dwarves with him none other indeed
than thorin oakenshield descendant of kings and his twelve companions in
exile with them he set out to his own lasting astonishment on a morning of
april it being then the year 1341 shire reckoning on a quest of great
treasure the dwarf hoards of the kings under the mountain beneath erebor in
dale far off in the east the quest was successful and the dragon that guarded
the hoard was destroyed yet though before all was won the battle of five
armies was fought and thorin was slain and many deeds of renown were done the
matter would scarcely have concerned later history or earned more than a note
in the long annals of the third age but for an accident by the way the party
was assailed by orcs in a high pass of the misty mountains as they went towards
wilderland and so it happened that bilbo was lost for a while in the black
orc mines deep under the mountains and there as he groped in vain in the dark
he put his hand on a ring lying on the floor of a tunnel he put it in his
pocket it seemed then like mere luck
trying to find his way out bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains
until he could go no further at the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far
from the light and on an island of rock in the water lived gollum he was a
loathsome little creature he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet
peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish with his long fingers
and eating them raw he ate any living thing even orc if he could catch it and
strangle it without a struggle he possessed a secret treasure that had come to
him long ages ago when he still lived in the light a ring of gold that made
its wearer invisible it was the one thing he loved his precious and he
talked to it even when it was not with him for he kept it hidden safe in a
hole on his island except when he was hunting or spying on the ores of the
mines
maybe he would have attacked bilbo at once if the ring had been on him when
they met but it was not and the hobbit held in his hand an elvish knife which
served him as a sword so to gain time gollum challenged bilbo to the
riddle game saying that if he asked a riddle which bilbo could not guess then
he would kill him and eat him but if bilbo defeated him then he would do as
bilbo wished he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels
since he was lost in the dark without hope and could neither go on nor back
bilbo accepted the challenge and they asked one another many riddles in the
end bilbo won the game more by luck as it seemed than by wits for he was
stumped at last for a riddle to ask and cried out as his hand came upon the
ring he lad picked up and forgotten what haw i got in my pocket this
gollum failed to answer though he demanded three guesses
the authorities it is true differ whether this last question was a mere
question and not a riddle according to the strict rules of the game but all
agree that after accepting it and trying to guess the answer gollum was bound
by his promise and bilbo pressed him to keep his word for the thought came to
him that this slimy creature might prove false even though such promises were
held sacred and of old all but the wickedest things feared to break them but
after ages alone in the dark gollum s heart was black and treachery was in
it he slipped away and returned to the island of which bilbo knew nothing
not far off in the dark water there he thought lay his ring he was hungry
now and angry and once his precious was with him he would not fear any
weapon at all
but the ring was not on the island he had lost it it was gone his screech
sent a shiver down bilbos back though he did not yet understand what had
happened but gollum had at last leaped to a guess too late what has it got
in its pocketses he cried the light in his eyes was like a green flame as
he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his precious just in time bilbo
saw his peril and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water and once
more he was saved by his luck for just as he ran he put his hand in his pocket
and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger so it was that gollum passed him
without seeing him and went to guard the way out lest the  thief  should
escape warily bilbo followed him as he went along cursing and talking to
himself about his precious from which talk at last even bilbo guessed the
truth and hope came to him in the darkness he himself had found the marvellous
ring and a chance of escape from the orcs and from gollum
at length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower
gates of the mines on the eastward side of the mountains there gollum crouched
at bay smelling and listening and bilbo was tempted to slay him with his
sword but pity stayed him and though he kept the ring in which his only hope
lay he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a
disadvantage in the end gathering his courage he leaped over gollum in the
dark and fled away down the passage pursued by his enemys cries of hate and
despair thief thief baggins we hates it for ever
now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as bilbo first told it to
his companions to them his account was that gollum had promised to give him a present
if he won the game but when gollum went to fetch it from his island he found
the treasure was gone a magic ring which had been given to him long ago on his
birthday bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found and as he
had won the game it was already his by right but being in a tight place he
said nothing about it and made gollum show him the way out as a reward instead
of a present this account bilbo set down in his memoirs and he seems never to
have altered it himself not even after the council of elrond evidently it
still appeared in the original red book as it did in several of the copies and
abstracts but many copies contain the true account as an alternative derived
no doubt from notes by frodo or samwise both of whom learned the truth though
they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old
hobbit himself
gandalf however disbelieved bilbos first story as soon as he heard it
and he continued to be very curious about the ring eventually he got the true
tale out of bilbo after much questioning which for a while strained their
friendship but the wizard seemed to think the truth important though he did
not say so to bilbo he also thought it important and disturbing to find that
the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first quite contrary to his
habit the idea of a present was not mere hobbitlike invention all the same
it was suggested to bilbo as he confessed by gollums talk that he overheard
for gollum did in fact call the ring his birthday present many times that
also gandalf thought strange and suspicious but he did not discover the truth
in this point for many more years as will be seen in this book
of bilbos later adventures little more need be said here with the help of
the ring he escaped from the orc guards at the gate and rejoined his companions
he used the ring many times on his quest chiefly for the help of his friends
but he kept it secret from them as long as he could after his return to his
home he never spoke of it again to anyone save gandalf and frodo and no one
else in the shire knew of its existence or so he believed only to frodo did he
show the account of his journey that he was writing
his sword sting bilbo hung over his fireplace and his coat of marvellous
mail the gift of the dwarves from the dragon hoard he lent to a museum to the
michel delving mathom house in fact but he kept in a drawer at bag end the old
cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels and the ring secured by a fine
chain remained in his pocket
he returned to his home at bag end on june the 22nd in his fifty second year
sr 1342 and nothing very notable occurred in the shire until mr baggins
began the preparations for the celebration of his hundred and eleventh birthday
sr 1401 at this point this history begins
 
at the end of the third age the part played by the hobbits in the great
events that led to the inclusion of the shire in the reunited kingdom awakened
among them a more widespread interest in their own history and many of their
traditions up to that time still mainly oral were collected and written down
the greater families were also concerned with events in the kingdom at large
and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends by the end
of the first century of the fourth age there were already to be found in the
shire several libraries that contained many historical books and records
the largest of these collections were probably at undertowers at great
smials and at brandy hall this account of the end of the third age is drawn
mainly from the red book of westmarch that most important source for the
history of the war of the ring was so called because it was long preserved at
undertowers the home of the fairbairns wardens of the westmarch it was in
origin bilbos private diary which he took with him to rivendell frodo brought
it back to the shire together with many loose leaves of notes and during sr
1420 1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the war but annexed to it
and preserved with it probably m a single red case were the three large
volumes bound in red leather that bilbo gave to him as a parting gift to
these four volumes there was added in westmarch a fifth containing commentaries
genealogies and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the
fellowship
the original red book has not been preserved but many copies were made
especially of the first volume for the use of the descendants of the children
of master samwise the most important copy however has a different history it
was kept at great smials but it was written in condor probably at the request
of the great grandson of peregrin and completed in sr 1592 fa 172 its
southern scribe appended this note findegil kings writer finished this work
in iv 172 it is an exact copy in all details of the thains book m minas
tirith that book was a copy made at the request of king elessar of the red
book of the periannath and was brought to him by the thain peregrin when he
retired to gondor in iv 64
the thains book was thus the first copy made of the red book and contained
much that was later omitted or lost in minas tirith it received much
annotation and many corrections especially of names words and quotations in
the elvish languages and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those
parts of the tale of aragorn and arwen which lie outside the account of
the war the full tale is stated to have been written by barahir grandson of
the steward faramir some time after the passing of the king but the chief
importance of findegils copy is that it alone contains the whole of bilbos
translations from the elvish these three volumes were found to be a work of
great skill and learning in which between 1403 and 1418 he had used all the
sources available to him in rivendell both living and written but since they
were little used by frodo being almost entirely concerned with the elder days
no more is said of them here
since meriadoc and peregrin became the heads of their great families and at
the same time kept up their connexions with rohan and gondor the libraries at
bucklebury and tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the red book
in brandy hall there were many works dealing with eriador and the history of
rohan some of these were composed or begun by meriadoc himself though in the
shire he was chiefly remembered for his herblore of the shire and for
his reckoning of years m which he discussed the relation of the calendars
of the shire and bree to those of rivendell gondor and rohan he also wrote a
short treatise on old words and names in the shire having special
interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the rohirrim of such
shire words as mathom and old elements in place names
at great smials the books were of less interest to shire folk though more
important for larger history none of them was written by peregrin but he and
his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of gondor mainly
copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to elendil and his heirs
only here in the shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of númenor
and the arising of sauron it was probably at great smials that the tale of
years was put together with the assistance of material collected by
meriadoc though the dates given are often conjectural especially for the
second age they deserve attention it is probable that meriadoc obtained
assistance and information from rivendell which he visited more than once
there though elrond had departed his sons long remained together with some of
the high elven folk it is said that celeborn went to dwell there after the
departure of galadriel but there is no record of the day when at last he sought
the grey havens and with him went the last living memory of the elder days in
middle earth
 
 
 
when mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced that he would shortly be
celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party of special magnificence
there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been the wonder of the shire
for sixty years ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return
the riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend
and it was popularly believed whatever the old folk might say that the hill at
bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure and if that was not enough
for fame there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at time wore on but it
seemed to have little effect on mr baggins at ninety he was much the same as
at fifty at ninety nine they began to call him well preserved but unchanged
would have been nearer the mark there were some that shook their heads and
thought this was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair that anyone should
possess apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexhaustible
wealth
 it will have to be paid for  they said  it isn t natural and
trouble will come of it 
but so far trouble had not come and as mr baggins was generous with his
money most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good
fortune he remained on visiting terms with his relatives except of course
the sackville bagginses and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of
poor and unimportant families but he had no close friends until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbo s favourite was young frodo baggins when
bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his heir and brought him to live at
bag end and the hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dashed bilbo and
frodo happened to have the same birthday september 22nd  you had better come
and live here frodo my lad  said bilbo one day  and then we can celebrate
our birthday parties comfortably together  at that time frodo was still in
his tweens as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between
childhood and coming of age at thirty three
twelve more years passed each year the bagginses had given very lively
combined birthday parties at bag end but now it was understood that something
quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn bilbo was going to be eleventy one
111 a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit the old
took himself had only reached 130 and frodo was going to be thirty three
33 an important number the date of his  coming of age 
tongues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour of the coming event
travelled all over the shire the history and character of mr bilbo baggins
became once again the chief topic of conversation and the older folk suddenly
found their reminiscences in welcome demand
no one had a more attentive audience than old ham gamgee commonly known as
the gaffer he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn on the bywater
road and he spoke with some authority for he had tended the garden at bag end
for forty years and had helped old holman in the same job before that now that
he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints the job was mainly carried
on by his youngest son sam gamgee both father and son were on very friendly
terms with bilbo and frodo they lived on the hill itself in number 3 bagshot
row just below bag end
 a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as i ve always
said  the gaffer declared with perfect truth for bilbo was very polite to
him calling him  master hamfast  and consulting him constantly upon the
growing of vegetables   in the matter of  roots  especially potatoes the
gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood
including himself
 but what about this frodo that lives with him  asked old noakes of
bywater  baggins is his name but he s more than half a brandybuck they
say it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go looking for a wife away
there in buckland where folks are so queer 
 and no wonder they re queer  put in daddy twofoot the gaffer s
next door neighbour  if they live on the wrong side of the brandywine river
and right agin the old forest that s a dark bad place if half the tales be
true 
 you re right dad  said the gaffer  not that the brandybucks of
buck land live in the old forest but they re a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river   and that isn t natural small
wonder that trouble came of it i say but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet very much like mr bilbo and in
more than looks after all his father was a baggins a decent respectable hobbit
was mr drogo baggins there was never much to tell of him till he was
drownded 
 drownded  said several voices they had heard this and other darker
rumours before of course but hobbits have a passion for family history and
they were ready to hear it again  well so they say  said the gaffer
 you see mr drogo he married poor miss primula brandybuck she was our mr
bilbo s first cousin on the mother s side her mother being the youngest of
the old took s daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin so mr frodo
is his first and second cousin once removed either way as the saying
is if you follow me and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did after his marriage him
being partial to his vittles and old gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table
and he went out boating on the brandywine river and he and his wife were
drownded and poor mr frodo only a child and all  
 i ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight  said
old noakes  and it was drogo s weight as sunk the boat 
 and i heard she pushed him in and he pulled her in after him 
said sandyman the hobbiton miller
 you shouldn t listen to all you hear sandyman  said the gaffer who
did not much like the miller  there isn t no call to go talking of pushing
and pulling boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without
looking further for the cause of trouble anyway there was this mr frodo left
an orphan and stranded as you might say among those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall a regular warren by all accounts old master
gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place mr
bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among
decent folk
 but i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville bagginses they
thought they were going to get bag end that time when he went off and was
thought to be dead and then he comes back and orders them off and he goes on
living and living and never looking a day older bless him and suddenly he
produces an heir and has all the papers made out proper the
sackville bagginses won t never see the inside of bag end now or it is to be
hoped not 
 there s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there i hear tell  said a
stranger a visitor on business from michel delving in the westfarthing  all
the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver and
jools by what i ve heard  
 then you ve heard more than i can speak to  answered the gaffer i
know nothing about jools mr bilbo is free with his money and there
seems no lack of it but i know of no tunnel making i saw mr bilbo when he
came back a matter of sixty years ago when i was a lad i d not long come
prentice to old holman him being my dad s cousin but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden
while the sale was on and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes up the hill
with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests i don t doubt
they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts where there
be mountains of gold they say but there wasn t enough to fill tunnels but
my lad sam will know more about that he s in and out of bag end crazy about
stories of the old days he is and he listens to all mr bilbo s tales mr
bilbo has learned him his letters   meaning no harm mark you and i hope no
harm will come of it
 elves and dragons 
but the gaffer did not convince his audience the legend of bilbo s wealth
was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits
 ah but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first 
argued the miller voicing common opinion  he s often away from home and
look at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarves coming at night and that
old wandering conjuror gandalf and all you can say what you like gaffer but
bag end s a queer place and its folk are queerer 
 and you can say what you like about what you know no more of than
you do of boating mr sandyman  retorted the gaffer disliking the miller
even more than usual if that s being queer then we could do with a bit more
queerness in these parts there s some not far away that wouldn t offer a
pint of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls but they do
things proper at bag end our sam says that everyone s going to be
invited to the party and there s going to be presents mark you presents for
all   this very month as is 
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask a day or two
later a rumour probably started by the knowledgeable sam was spread about that
there were going to be fireworks   fireworks what is more such as had not been
seen in the shire for nigh on a century not indeed since the old took died
days passed and the day drew nearer an odd looking waggon laden with
odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton one evening and toiled up the hill to
bag end the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it it was
driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves with long beards and
deep hoods a few of them remained at bag end at the end of the second week in
september a cart came in through bywater from the direction of the brandywine
bridge in broad daylight an old man was driving it all alone he wore a tall
pointed blue hat a long grey cloak and a silver scarf he had a long white
beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat small
hobbit children ran after the cart all through hobbiton and right up the hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly guessed at bilbo s front door
the old man began to unload there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts
and shapes each labelled with a large red g 
and the elf rune 
that was gandalf s mark of course and the old man was gandalf the wizard
whose fame in the shire was due mainly to his skill with fires smokes and
lights his real business was far more difficult and dangerous but the
shire folk knew nothing about it to them he was just one of the
 attractions  at the party hence the excitement of the hobbit children
 g for grand  they shouted and the old man smiled they knew him by sight
though he only appeared in hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but
neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework
displays   they now belonged to the legendary past
when the old man helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single squib or cracker was
forthcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers
 run away now  said gandalf  you will get plenty when the time
comes  then he disappeared inside with bilbo and the door was shut the
young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while and then made off feeling
that the day of the party would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small
room looking out west on to the garden the late afternoon was bright and
peaceful the flowers glowed red and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round
windows
 how bright your garden looks  said gandalf
 yes  said bilbo i am very fond indeed of it and of all the dear old
shire but i think i need a holiday 
 you mean to go on with your plan then 
 i do i made up my mind months ago and i haven t changed it 
 very well it is no good saying any more stick to your plan   your whole
plan mind   and i hope it will turn out for the best for you and for all of
us 
 i hope so anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday and have my little
joke 
 who will laugh i wonder  said gandalf shaking his head
 we shall see  said bilbo
the next day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts there might
have been some grumbling about  dealing locally  but that very week orders
began to pour out of bag end for every kind of provision commodity or luxury
that could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the days on the calendar
and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations
before long the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton post office
was blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under and voluntary
assistant postmen were called for there was a constant stream of them going up
the hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall
certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no admittance except on party
business even those who had or pretended to have party business were seldom
allowed inside bilbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers
packing up presents and making some private preparations of his own from the
time of gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to find the large field south of bilbo s
front door covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions a special
entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road and wide steps and a large
white gate were built there the three hobbit families of bagshot row adjoining
the field were intensely interested and generally envied old gaffer gamgee
stopped even pretending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up there was a specially large pavilion so big that
the tree that grew in the field was right inside it and stood proudly near one
end at the head of the chief table lanterns were hung on all its branches
more promising still to the hobbits  mind an enormous open air kitchen was
erected in the north corner of the field a draught of cooks from every inn and
eating house for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd
folk that were quartered at bag end excitement rose to its height
then the weather clouded over that was on wednesday the eve of the party
anxiety was intense then thursday september the 22nd actually dawned the sun
got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins called it a party but it was really a variety of
entertainments rolled into one practically everybody living near was invited a
very few were overlooked by accident but as they turned up all the same that
did not matter many people from other parts of the shire were also asked and
there were even a few from outside the borders bilbo met the guests and
additions at the new white gate in person he gave away presents to all and
sundry   the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in
again by the gate hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so lavishly as on this occasion but
it was not a bad system actually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
it was somebody s birthday so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair
chance of at least one present at least once a week but they never got tired of
them
on this occasion the presents were unusually good the hobbit children were
so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating there were toys the
like of which they had never seen before all beautiful and some obviously
magical many of them had indeed been ordered a year before and had come all
the way from the mountain and from dale and were of real dwarf make
when every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate there
were songs dances music games and of course food and drink there were
three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper but lunch and tea were
marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down
and eating together at other times there were merely lots of people eating and
drinking   continuously from elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks
started
the fireworks were by gandalf they were not only brought by him but
designed and made by him and the special effects set pieces and flights of
rockets were let off by him but there was also a generous distribution of
squibs crackers backarappers sparklers torches dwarf candles
elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps they were all superb the art
of gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet
voices there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their leaves opened
like a whole spring unfolding in a moment and their shining branches dropped
glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet
scent just before they touched their upturned faces there were fountains of
butterflies that flew glittering into the trees there were pillars of coloured
fires that rose and turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of flying
swans there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain there was a
forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an
embattled army and came down again into the water with a hiss like a hundred
hot snakes and there was also one last surprise in honour of bilbo and it
startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended the lights went out a
great smoke went up it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance and
began to glow at the summit it spouted green and scarlet flames out flew a
red golden dragon   not life size but terribly life like fire came from his
jaws his eyes glared down there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd they all ducked and many fell flat on their faces the
dragon passed like an express train turned a somersault and burst over bywater
with a deafening explosion
 that is the signal for supper  said bilbo the pain and alarm vanished
at once and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet there was a splendid
supper for everyone for everyone that is except those invited to the special
family dinner party this was held in the great pavilion with the tree the
invitations were limited to twelve dozen a number also called by the hobbits
one gross though the word was not considered proper to use of people and the
guests were selected from all the families to which bilbo and frodo were
related with the addition of a few special unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobbits were included and present by parental permission for
hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter of sitting up late
especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal bringing up
young hobbits took a lot of provender
there were many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks and brandybucks
there were various grubbs relations of bilbo baggins  grandmother and
various chubbs connexions of his took grandfather and a selection of
burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goodbodies hornblowers and
proudfoots some of these were only very distantly connected with bilbo and
some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton before as they lived in remote
corners of the shire the sackville bagginses were not forgotten otho and his
wife lobelia were present they disliked bilbo and detested frodo but so
magnificent was the invitation card written in golden ink that they had felt
it was impossible to refuse besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing
in food for many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hundred and forty four guests expected a pleasant feast though
they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their host an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry and sometimes after a
glass or two would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey
the guests were not disappointed they had a very pleasant feast in fact
an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged the purchase
of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing
weeks but as bilbo s catering had depleted the stocks of most stores cellars
and warehouses for miles around that did not matter much
after the feast more or less came the speech most of the company were
however now in a tolerant mood at that delightful stage which they called
 filling up the corners  they were sipping their favourite drinks and
nibbling at their favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten they were
prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop
my dear people
my dear bagginses and boffins
proudfoots
/ hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am deafening
cheers cries of yes and no noises of trumpets and horns pipes
and flutes and other musical instruments there were as has been said many
young hobbits present hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled most of
them bore the mark dale on them which did not convey much to most of the
hobbits but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers they contained
instruments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones indeed in one
corner some of the young tooks and brandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to have
finished since he had plainly said all that was necessary now got up an
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance tune master everard took and miss
melilot brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finished seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew
three loud hoots the noise subsided / shall not keep you long he
cried cheers from all the assembly / have called you all together for a
purpose something in the way that he said this made an impression there
was almost silence and one or two of the tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you that i am immensely
fond of you all and that eleventy one years is too short a time to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
/ don t know half of you half as well as i should like and i like less
than half of you half as well as you deserve this was unexpected and rather
difficult there was some scattered clapping but most of them were trying to
work it out and see if it came to a compliment
secondly to celebrate my birthday
it is also if i may be allowed to refer to ancient history the anniversary
of my arrival by barrel at esgaroth on the long lake though the fact that it
was
thirdly and finally
he stepped down and vanished there was a blinding flash of light and the
guests all blinked when they opened their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless old odo
proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped then there was a dead
silence until suddenly after several deep breaths every baggins boffin
took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows bolger bracegirdle brockhouse
goodbody hornblower and proudfoot began to talk at once
it was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste and more food
and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance  he s mad
i always said so  was probably the most popular comment even the tooks with
a few exceptions thought bilbo s behaviour was absurd for the moment most of
them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a
ridiculous prank
but old rory brandybuck was not so sure neither age nor an enormous dinner
had clouded his wits and he said to his daughter in law esmeralda
 there s something fishy in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off
again silly old fool but why worry he hasn t taken the vittles with him 
he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again
frodo was the only one present who had said nothing for some time he had sat
silent beside bilbo s empty chair and ignored all remarks and questions he
had enjoyed the joke of course even though he had been in the know he had
difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests but
at the same time he felt deeply troubled he realized suddenly that he loved the
old hobbit dearly most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing
bilbo baggins  oddities past and present but the sackville bagginses had
already departed in wrath frodo did not want to have any more to do with the
party he gave orders for more wine to be served then he got up and drained his
own glass silently to the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
as for bilbo baggins even while he was making his speech he had been
fingering the golden ring in his pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret
for so many years as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger and he was
never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for a moment listening with a
smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts
of the field then he went in he took off his party clothes folded up and
wrapped in tissue paper his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it away then he
put on quickly some old untidy garments and fastened round his waist a worn
leather belt on it he hung a short sword in a battered black leather scabbard
from a locked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out an old cloak and hood
they had been locked up as if they were very precious but they were so patched
and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed it might
have been dark green they were rather too large for him he then went into his
study and from a large strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and
a leather bound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope the book and bundle
he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly
full into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its fine chain and then
sealed it and addressed it to frodo at first he put it on the mantelpiece but
suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket at that moment the door
opened and gandalf came quickly in
 hullo  said bilbo i wondered if you would turn up 
i am glad to find you visible  replied the wizard sitting down in a
chair i wanted to catch you and have a few final words i suppose you feel
that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan 
 yes i do  said bilbo though that flash was surprising it quite
startled me let alone the others a little addition of your own i suppose 
it was you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years and it seemed
to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain
your sudden vanishment 
 and would spoil my joke you are an interfering old busybody  laughed
bilbo  but i expect you know best as usual 
 i do   when i know anything but i don t feel too sure about this whole
affair it has now come to the final point you have had your joke and alarmed
or offended most of your relations and given the whole shire something to talk
about for nine days or ninety nine more likely are you going any further 
 yes i am i feel i need a holiday a very long holiday as i have told
you before probably a permanent holiday i don t expect i shall return in
fact i don t mean to and i have made all arrangements
i am old gandalf i don t look it but i am beginning to feel it in my
heart of hearts well preserved indeed  he snorted  why i feel all
thin sort of stretched if you know what i mean like butter that has
been scraped over too much bread that can t be right i need a change or
something 
gandalf looked curiously and closely at him  no it does not seem
right  he said thoughtfully  no after all i believe your plan is probably
the best 
 well i ve made up my mind anyway i want to see mountains again
gandalf mountains and then find somewhere where i can rest in
peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying around and a string of
confounded visitors hanging on the bell i might find somewhere where i can
finish my book i have thought of a nice ending for it and he lived happily
ever after to the end of his days  
gandalf laughed i hope he will but nobody will read the book however it
ends 
 oh they may in years to come frodo has read some already as far as it
has gone you ll keep an eye on frodo won t you 
 yes i will   two eyes as often as i can spare them 
 he would come with me of course if i asked him in fact he offered to
once just before the party but he does not really want to yet i want to see
the wild country again before i die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with woods and fields and little rivers he ought to be
comfortable here i am leaving everything to him of course except a few
oddments i hope he will be happy when he gets used to being on his own it s
time he was his own master now 
 everything  said gandalf  the ring as well you agreed to that you
remember 
 well er yes i suppose so  stammered bilbo
 where is it 
 in an envelope if you must know  said bilbo impatiently  there on
the mantelpiece well no here it is in my pocket  he hesitated  isn t
that odd now  he said softly to himself  yet after all why not why
shouldn t it stay there 
gandalf looked again very hard at bilbo and there was a gleam in his eyes
 i think bilbo  he said quietly  i should leave it behind don t you
want to 
 well yes   and no now it comes to it i don t like parting with it at
all i may say and i don t really see why i should why do you want me to 
he asked and a curious change came over his voice it was sharp with suspicion
and annoyance  you are always badgering me about my ring but you have never
bothered me about the other things that i got on my journey 
 no but i had to badger you  said gandalf  i wanted the truth it
was important magic rings are   well magical and they are rare and curious i
was professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am i
should like to know where it is if you go wandering again also i think you have
had it quite long enough you won t need it any more bilbo unless i am quite
mistaken 
bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his eyes his kindly face grew
hard  why not  he cried  and what business is it of yours anyway to
know what i do with my own things it is my own i found it it came to me 
 yes yes  said gandalf  but there is no need to get angry 
 if i am it is your fault  said bilbo  it is mine i tell you my
own my precious yes my precious 
the wizard s face remained grave and attentive and only a flicker in his
deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed  it has been called
that before  he said  but not by you 
 but i say it now and why not even if gollum said the same once it s
not his now but mine and i shall keep it i say 
gandalf stood up he spoke sternly  you will be a fool if you do
bilbo  he said  you make that clearer with every word you say it has got
far too much hold on you let it go and then you can go yourself and be
free 
 i ll do as i choose and go as i please  said bilbo obstinately
 now now my dear hobbit   said gandalf  all your long life we have
been friends and you owe me something come do as you promised give it up
 
 well if you want my ring yourself say so  cried bilbo  but you
won t get it i won t give my precious away i tell you  his hand strayed
to the hilt of his small sword
gandalf s eyes flashed it will be my turn to get angry soon  he said
if you say that again i shall then you will see gandalf the grey uncloaked 
he took a step towards the hobbit and he seemed to grow tall and menacing his
shadow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his
pocket they stood for a while facing one another and the air of the room
tingled gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit slowly his hands relaxed
and he began to tremble
 i don t know what has come over you gandalf  he said  you have
never been like this before what is it all about it is mine isn t it i
found it and gollum would have killed me if i hadn t kept it i m not a
thief whatever he said 
 i have never called you one  gandalf answered  and i am not one
either i am not trying to rob you but to help you i wish you would trust me
as you used  he turned away and the shadow passed he seemed to dwindle
again to an old grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes i am sorry  he said  but i felt so
queer and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any
more it has been so growing on my mind lately sometimes i have felt it was
like an eye looking at me and i am always wanting to put it on and disappear
don t you know or wondering if it is safe and pulling it out to make sure i
tried locking it up but i found i couldn t rest without it in my pocket i
don t know why and i don t seem able to make up my mind 
 then trust mine  said gandalf  it is quite made up go away and
leave it behind stop possessing it give it to frodo and i will look after
him 
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided presently he sighed  all
right  he said with an effort i will  then he shrugged his shoulders and
smiled rather ruefully  after all that s what this party business was all
about really to give away lots of birthday presents and somehow make it
easier to give it away at the same time it hasn t made it any easier in the
end but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations it would quite spoil
the joke 
 indeed it would take away the only point i ever saw in the affair  said
gandalf
 very well  said bilbo  it goes to frodo with all the rest  he
drew a deep breath  and now i really must be starting or somebody else will
catch me i have said good bye and i couldn t bear to do it all over
again  he picked up his bag and moved to the door
 you have still got the ring in your pocket  said the wizard  well
so i have  cried bilbo  and my will and all the other documents too you
had better take it and deliver it for me that will be safest 
 no don t give the ring to me  said gandalf  put it on the
mantelpiece it will be safe enough there till frodo comes i shall wait for
him 
bilbo took out the envelope but just as he was about to set it by the clock
his hand jerked back and the packet fell on the floor before he could pick it
up the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place a spasm of anger
passed swiftly over the hobbit s face again suddenly it gave way to a look of
relief and a laugh  well that s that  he said  now i m off 
they went out into the hall bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand
then he whistled three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been
busy
 is everything ready  asked bilbo  everything packed and labelled 
 everything  they answered
 well let s start then  he stepped out of the front door
it was a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars he looked up
sniffing the air  what fun what fun to be off again off on the road with
dwarves this is what i have really been longing for for years good bye  
he said looking at his old home and bowing to the door  good bye
gandalf 
 good bye for the present bilbo take care of yourself you are old
enough and perhaps wise enough 
 take care i don t care don t you worry about me i am as happy now
as i have ever been and that is saying a great deal but the time has come i
am being swept off my feet at last  he added and then in a low voice as if
to himself he sang softly in the dark
the road goes ever on and on

down from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

and i must follow if i can

pursuing it with eager feet

until it joins some larger way

where many paths and errands meet

and whither then i cannot say
he paused silent for a moment then without another word he turned away from
the lights and voices in the fields and tents and followed by his three
companions went round into his garden and trotted down the long sloping path
he jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the meadows
passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness  goodbye
my dear bilbo   until our next meeting  he said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in the dark deep in
thought  has he gone  he asked
 yes  answered gandalf  he has gone at last 
 i wish   i mean i hoped until this evening that it was only a joke 
said frodo  but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go he always used
to joke about serious things i wish i had come back sooner just to see him
off 
i think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end  said gandalf
 don t be too troubled he ll be all right   now he left a packet for
you there it is 
frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece and glanced at it but did not
open it
 you ll find his will and all the other documents in there i think 
said the wizard  you are the master of bag end now and also i fancy
you ll find a golden ring 
 the ring  exclaimed frodo  has he left me that i wonder why still
it may be useful 
 it may and it may not  said gandalf  i should not make use of it
if i were you but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed 
as master of bag end frodo felt it his painful duty to say good bye to the
guests rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field but
frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning about
midnight carriages came for the important folk one by one they rolled away
filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits gardeners came by arrangement
and removed in wheel barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind
night slowly passed the sun rose the hobbits rose rather later morning
went on people came and began by orders to clear away the pavilions and the
tables and the chairs and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates and the
lanterns and the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten food a very
small item then a number of other people came without orders bagginses and
boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that lived or were staying
near by mid day when even the best fed were out and about again there was a
large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking rather tired and worried
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much more to say than before his
reply to all inquiries was simply this  mr bilbo baggins has gone away as
far as i know for good  some of the visitors he invited to come inside as
bilbo had left  messages  for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels
and small articles of furniture on every item there was a label tied there
were several labels of this sort
for adelard took for his very own from bilbo
for dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence with love from bilbo
for milo burrows hoping it will be useful from bb
for angelica s use from uncle bilbo
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contributor
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present
this is only a small selection of the assembled presents bilbo s residence
had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life it was a
tendency of hobbit holes to get cluttered up for which the custom of giving so
many birthday presents was largely responsible not of course that the
birthday presents were always new there were one or two old mathoms
of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district but bilbo had
usually given new presents and kept those that he received the old hole was
now being cleared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written out personally by
bilbo and several had some point or some joke but of course most of the
things were given where they would be wanted and welcome the poorer hobbits
and especially those of bagshot row did very well old gaffer gamgee got two
sacks of potatoes a new spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment
for creaking joints old rory brandybuck in return for much hospitality got a
dozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine from the southfarthing and now
quite mature as it had been laid down by bilbo s father rory quite forgave
bilbo and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle
there was plenty of everything left for frodo and of course all the chief
treasures as well as the books pictures and more than enough furniture were
left in his possession there was however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon a false rumour that the whole
household was being distributed free spread like wildfire and before long the
place was packed with people who had no business there but could not be kept
out labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out some people tried to
do swaps and deals in the hall and others tried to make off with minor
items not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginses arrived frodo had
retired for a while and left his friend merry brandybuck to keep an eye on
things when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed politely
 he is indisposed  he said  he is resting 
 hiding you mean  said lobelia  anyway we want to see him and we
mean to see him just go and tell him so 
merry left them a long while in the hall and they had time to discover their
parting gift of spoons it did not improve their tempers eventually they were
shown into the study frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front
of him he looked indisposed   to see sackville bagginses at any rate and he
stood up fidgeting with something in his pocket but he spoke quite politely
the sackville bagginses were rather offensive they began by offering him bad
bargain prices as between friends for various valuable and unlabelled things
when frodo replied that only the things specially directed by bilbo were being
given away they said the whole affair was very fishy
 only one thing is clear to me  said otho  and that is that you are
doing exceedingly well out of it i insist on seeing the will 
otho would have been bilbo s heir but for the adoption of frodo he read
the will carefully and snorted it was unfortunately very clear and correct
according to the legal customs of hobbits which demand among other things
seven signatures of witnesses in red ink
 foiled again  he said to his wife  and after waiting sixty
years spoons fiddlesticks  he snapped his fingers under frodo s nose and
slumped off but lobelia was not so easily got rid of a little later frodo came
out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the
place investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors he escorted her
firmly off the premises after he had relieved her of several small but rather
valuable articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella her face looked
as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark
but all she found to say turning round on the step was
 you ll live to regret it young fellow why didn t you go too you
don t belong here you re no baggins   you   you re a brandybuck 
 did you hear that merry that was an insult if you like  said frodo
as he shut the door on her
 it was a compliment  said merry brandybuck  and so of course not
true 
then they went round the hole and evicted three young hobbits two boffins
and a bolger who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars frodo
also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot old odo proudfoot s grandson
who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry where he thought there was an
echo the legend of bilbo s gold excited both curiosity and hope for
legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is as
every one knows any one s for the finding   unless the search is interrupted
when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out frodo collapsed on a chair in
the hall it s time to close the shop merry  he said  lock the door
and don t open it to anyone today not even if they bring a battering ram 
then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the front door
 lobelia again most likely  he thought  she must have thought of
something really nasty and have come back again to say it it can wait 
he went on with his tea the knock was repeated much louder but he took no
notice suddenly the wizard s head appeared at the window
 if you don t let me in frodo i shall blow your door right down your
hole and out through the hill  he said
 my dear gandalf half a minute  cried frodo running out of the room to
the door  come in come in i thought it was lobelia 
 then i forgive you but i saw her some time ago driving a pony trap
towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk 
 she had already nearly curdled me honestly i nearly tried on bilbo s
ring i longed to disappear 
 don t do that  said gandalf sitting down  do be careful of that
ring frodo in fact it is partly about that that i have come to say a last
word 
 well what about it 
 what do you know already 
 only what bilbo told me i have heard his story how he found it and how
he used it on his journey i mean 
 which story i wonder  said gandalf
 oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book  said frodo  he
told me the true story soon after i came to live here he said you had pestered
him till he told you so i had better know too no secrets between us
frodo he said but they are not to go any further it s mine
anyway 
 that s interesting  said gandalf  well what did you think of it
all 
 if you mean inventing all that about a present well i
thought the true story much more likely and i couldn t see the point of
altering it at all it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and i thought it
rather odd 
 so did i but odd things may happen to people that have such treasures  
if they use them let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it it may
have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to 
 i don t understand  said frodo
 neither do i  answered the wizard  i have merely begun to wonder
about the ring especially since last night no need to worry but if you take
my advice you will use it very seldom or not at all at least i beg you not to
use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion i say again keep it
safe and keep it secret 
 you are very mysterious what are you afraid of 
 i am not certain so i will say no more i may be able to tell you
something when i come back i am going off at once so this is good bye for the
present  he got up
 at once  cried frodo  why i thought you were staying on for at
least a week i was looking forward to your help 
 i did mean to   but i have had to change my mind i may be away for a good
while but i ll come and see you again as soon as i can expect me when you
see me i shall slip in quietly i shan t often be visiting the shire openly
again i find that i have become rather unpopular they say i am a nuisance and
a disturber of the peace some people are actually accusing me of spiriting
bilbo away or worse if you want to know there is supposed to be a plot
between you and me to get hold of his wealth 
 some people  exclaimed frodo  you mean otho and lobelia how
abominable i would give them bag end and everything else if i could get bilbo
back and go off tramping in the country with him i love the shire but i begin
to wish somehow that i had gone too i wonder if i shall ever see him
again 
 so do i  said gandalf  and i wonder many other things good bye now
take care of yourself look out for me especially at unlikely times
good bye 
frodo saw him to the door he gave a final wave of his hand and walked off
at a surprising pace but frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent
almost as if he was carrying a great weight the evening was closing in and his
cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight frodo did not see him again
for a long time
 
the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine days the second
disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in hobbiton and indeed all
over the shire for a year and a day and was remembered much longer than that
it became a fireside story for young hobbits and eventually mad baggins who
used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and
gold became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the
true events were forgotten
but in the meantime the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that bilbo
who had always been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and had run off
into the blue there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come
to a tragic but hardly an untimely end the blame was mostly laid on gandalf
 if only that dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone perhaps he ll
settle down and grow some hobbit sense  they said and to all appearance the
wizard did leave frodo alone and he did settle down but the growth of
hobbit sense was not very noticeable indeed he at once began to carry on
bilbo s reputation for oddity he refused to go into mourning and the next
year he gave a party in honour of bilbo s hundred and twelfth birthday which
he called hundred weight feast but that was short of the mark for twenty
guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and
rained drink as hobbits say
some people were rather shocked but frodo kept up the custom of giving
bilbo s birthday party year after year until they got used to it he said that
he did not think bilbo was dead when they asked  where is he then  he
shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had a good many friends especially
among the younger hobbits mostly descendants of the old took who had as
children been fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end folco boffin and
fredegar bolger were two of these but his closest friends were peregrin took
usually called pippin and merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but
that was seldom remembered frodo went tramping all over the shire with them
but more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement of sensible folk he
was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the
starlight merry and pippin suspected that he visited the elves at times as
bilbo had done
as time went on people began to notice that frodo also showed signs of good
 preservation  outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and
energetic hobbit just out of his tweens  some folk have all the luck  they
said but it was not until frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty
that they began to think it queer
frodo himself after the first shock found that being his own master and the
mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant for some years he was quite happy
and did not worry much about the future but half unknown to himself the regret
that he had not gone with bilbo was steadily growing he found himself wondering
at times especially in the autumn about the wild lands and strange visions of
mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams he began to say to
himself  perhaps i shall cross the river myself one day  to which the
other half of his mind always replied  not yet 
so it went on until his forties were running out and his fiftieth birthday
was drawing near fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant or
ominous it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen
bilbo frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too well trodden
he looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their edges maps made in the
shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders he took to wandering
further afield and more often by himself and merry and his other friends
watched him anxiously often he was seen walking and talking with the strange
wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the shire
there were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside and as
gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years
frodo gathered all the news he could elves who seldom walked in the shire
could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing and
not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were no longer concerned
with its troubles there were however dwarves on the road in unusual numbers
the ancient east west road ran through the shire to its end at the grey havens
and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the blue
mountains they were the hobbits  chief source of news from distant parts   if
they wanted any as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more but
now frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries seeking refuge in the
west they were troubled and some spoke in whispers of the enemy and of the
land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past like a shadow in
the background of their memories but it was ominous and disquieting it seemed
that the evil power in mirkwood had been driven out by the white council only to
reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor the dark tower
had been rebuilt it was said from there the power was spreading far and wide
and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear orcs were
multiplying again in the mountains trolls were abroad no longer dull witted
but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons and there were murmured hints of
creatures more terrible than all these but they had no name
little of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits but even
the deafest and most stay at home began to hear queer tales and those whose
business took them to the borders saw strange things the conversation in the
green dragon at bywater one evening in the spring of frodo s fiftieth
year showed that even in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed at them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire and opposite him was ted
sandyman the miller s son and there were various other rustic hobbits
listening to their talk
 queer things you do hear these days to be sure  said sam
 ah  said ted  you do if you listen but i can hear fireside tales
and children s stories at home if i want to 
 no doubt you can  retorted sam  and i daresay there s more truth
in some of them than you reckon who invented the stories anyway take dragons
now 
 no thank  ee  said ted  i won t i heard tell of them when i was
a youngster but there s no call to believe in them now there s only one
dragon in bywater and that s green  he said getting a general laugh
 all right  said sam laughing with the rest  but what about these
tree men these giants as you might call them they do say that one bigger than
a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back 
 who s they 
 my cousin hal for one he works for mr boffin at overhill and goes up to
the northfarthing for the hunting he saw one 
 says he did perhaps your hal s always saying he s seen things and
maybe he sees things that ain t there 
 but this one was as big as an elm tree and walking   walking seven yards
to a stride if it was an inch 
 then i bet it wasn t an inch what he saw was an elm tree as
like as not 
 but this one was walking i tell you and there ain t no elm tree
on the north moors 
 then hal can t have seen one  said ted there was some laughing and
clapping the audience seemed to think that ted had scored a point
 all the same  said sam  you can t deny that others besides our
halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire   crossing it mind you there
are more that are turned back at the borders the bounders have never been so
busy before
 and i ve heard tell that elves are moving west they do say they are
going to the harbours out away beyond the white towers  sam waved his arm
vaguely neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the sea past the old
towers beyond the western borders of the shire but it was an old tradition that
away over there stood the grey havens from which at times elven ships set sail
never to return
 they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are going into the
west and leaving us  said sam half chanting the words shaking his head
sadly and solemnly but ted laughed
 well that isn t anything new if you believe the old tales and i
don t see what it matters to me or you let them sail but i warrant you
haven t seen them doing it nor any one else in the shire 
 well i don t know  said sam thoughtfully he believed he had once
seen an elf in the woods and still hoped to see more one day of all the
legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and
half remembered stories about the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved
him most deeply  there are some even in these parts as know the fair folk
and get news of them  he said  there s mr baggins now that i work for
he told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elves and old mr
bilbo knew more many s the talk i had with him when i was a little lad 
 oh they re both cracked  said ted  leastways old bilbo was
cracked and frodo s cracking if that s where you get your news from
you ll never want for moonshine well friends i m off home your good
health  he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sat silent and said no more he had a good deal to think about for one
thing there was a lot to do up in the bag end garden and he would have a busy
day tomorrow if the weather cleared the grass was growing fast but sam had
more on his mind than gardening after a while he sighed and got up and went
out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain the sun was
down and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night he walked home
under the early stars through hobbiton and up the hill whistling softly and
thoughtfully
it was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long absence for
three years after the party he had been away then he paid frodo a brief visit
and after taking a good look at him he went off again during the next year or
two he had turned up fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off
without warning before sunrise he would not discuss his own business and
journeys and seemed chiefly interested in small news about frodo s health and
doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased it was over nine years since frodo had
seen or heard of him and he had begun to think that the wizard would never
return and had given up all interest in hobbits but that evening as sam was
walking home and twilight was fading there came the once familiar tap on the
study window
frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight they looked
hard at one another
 ah well eh  said gandalf  you look the same as ever frodo 
 so do you  frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked
older and more careworn he pressed him for news of himself and of the wide
world and soon they were deep in talk and they stayed up far into the night
next morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting with frodo by the
open window of the study a bright fire was on the hearth but the sun was warm
and the wind was in the south everything looked fresh and the new green of
spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees  fingers
gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly eighty years before when bilbo had
run out of bag end without a handkerchief his hair was perhaps whiter than it
had been then and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer and his face more
lined with care and wisdom but his eyes were as bright as ever and he smoked
and blew smoke rings with the same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that gandalf
had brought at last he broke the silence
 last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring gandalf 
he said  and then you stopped because you said that such matters were best
left until daylight don t you think you had better finish now you say the
ring is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess in what way 
 in many ways  answered the wizard it is far more powerful than i ever
dared to think at first so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome
anyone of mortal race who possessed it it would possess him
 in eregion long ago many elven rings were made magic rings as you call
them and they were of course of various kinds some more potent and some
less the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full grown
and to the elven smiths they were but trifles   yet still to my mind dangerous
for mortals but the great rings the rings of power they were perilous
 a mortal frodo who keeps one of the great rings does not die but he
does not grow or obtain more life he merely continues until at last every
minute is a weariness and if he often uses the ring to make himself invisible
he fades he becomes in the end invisible permanently and walks in the
twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the rings yes sooner or
later   later if he is strong or well meaning to begin with but neither
strength nor good purpose will last   sooner or later the dark power will devour
him 
 how terrifying  said frodo there was another long silence the sound
of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden
 how long have you known this  asked frodo at length  and how much
did bilbo know 
 bilbo knew no more than he told you i am sure  said gandalf  he
would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a
danger even though i promised to look after you he thought the ring was very
beautiful and very useful at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was
himself he said that it was “growing on his mind” and he was always
worrying about it but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame
though he had found out that the thing needed looking after it did not seem
always of the same size or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way and
might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight 
 yes he warned me of that in his last letter  said frodo  so i have
always kept it on its chain 
 very wise  said gandalf  but as for his long life bilbo never
connected it with the ring at all he took all the credit for that to himself
and he was very proud of it though he was getting restless and uneasy thin
and stretched he said a sign that the ring was getting control 
 how long have you known all this  asked frodo again
 known  said gandalf  i have known much that only the wise know
frodo but if you mean “known about this ring” well i still do not know
one might say there is a last test to make but i no longer doubt my guess
 when did i first begin to guess  he mused searching back in memory
 let me see   it was in the year that the white council drove the dark power
from mirkwood just before the battle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart then though i did not know yet what i feared i
wondered often how gollum came by a great ring as plainly it was   that at
least was clear from the first then i heard bilbo s strange story of how he
had “won” it and i could not believe it when i at last got the truth out
of him i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring
beyond doubt much like gollum with his “birthday present” the lies were
too much alike for my comfort clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that
set to work on its keeper at once that was the first real warning i had that
all was not well i told bilbo often that such rings were better left unused
but he resented it and soon got angry there was little else that i could do i
could not take it from him without doing greater harm and i had no right to do
so anyway i could only watch and wait i might perhaps have consulted saruman
the white but something always held me back 
 who is he  asked frodo i have never heard of him before 
 maybe not  answered gandalf  hobbits are or were no concern of
his yet he is great among the wise he is the chief of my order and the head of
the council his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with it and he
takes ill any meddling the lore of the elven rings great and small is his
province he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of their making but
when the rings were debated in the council all that he would reveal to us of
his ring lore told against my fears so my doubt slept   but uneasily still i
watched and i waited
 and all seemed well with bilbo and the years passed yes they passed
and they seemed not to touch him he showed no signs of age the shadow fell on
me again but i said to myself “after all he comes of a long lived family on
his mother s side there is time yet wait”
 and i waited until that night when he left this house he said and did
things then that filled me with a fear that no words of saruman could allay i
knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work and i have spent most
of the years since then in finding out the truth of it 
 there wasn t any permanent harm done was there  asked frodo
anxiously  he would get all right in time wouldn t he be able to rest in
peace i mean 
 he felt better at once  said gandalf  but there is only one power in
this world that knows all about the rings and their effects and as far as i
know there is no power in the world that knows all about hobbits among the wise
i am the only one that goes in for hobbit lore an obscure branch of knowledge
but full of surprises soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as tough as
old tree roots i think it likely that some would resist the rings far longer
than most of the wise would believe i don t think you need worry about bilbo
 of course he possessed the ring for many years and used it so it might
take a long while for the influence to wear off   before it was safe for him to
see it again for instance otherwise he might live on for years quite
happily just stop as he was when he parted with it for he gave it up in the
end of his own accord an important point no i was not troubled about dear
bilbo any more once he had let the thing go it is for you that i feel
responsible
 ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about you and about
all these charming absurd helpless hobbits it would be a grievous blow to the
world if the dark power overcame the shire if all your kind jolly stupid
bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest not to mention the
ridiculous bagginses became enslaved 
frodo shuddered  but why should we be  he asked  and why should he
want such slaves 
 to tell you the truth  replied gandalf  i believe that hitherto   hitherto
mark you   he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits you should
be thankful but your safety has passed he does not need you   he has many more
useful servants   but he won t forget you again and hobbits as miserable
slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and free there is such a
thing as malice and revenge 
 revenge  said frodo  revenge for what i still don t understand
what all this has to do with bilbo and myself and our ring 
 it has everything to do with it  said gandalf  you do not know the
real peril yet but you shall i was not sure of it myself when i was last here
but the time has come to speak give me the ring for a moment 
frodo took it from his breeches pocket where it was clasped to a chain that
hung from his belt he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard it felt
suddenly very heavy as if either it or frodo himself was in some way reluctant
for gandalf to touch it
gandalf held it up it looked to be made of pure and solid gold  can you
see any markings on it  he asked
 no  said frodo  there are none it is quite plain and it never
shows a scratch or sign of wear 
 well then look  to frodo s astonishment and distress the wizard
threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire frodo gave a
cry and groped for the tongs but gandalf held him back
 wait  he said in a commanding voice giving frodo a quick look from
under his bristling brows
no apparent change came over the ring after a while gandalf got up closed
the shutters outside the window and drew the curtains the room became dark and
silent though the clack of sam s shears now nearer to the windows could
still be heard faintly from the garden for a moment the wizard stood looking at
the fire then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs and
at once picked it up frodo gasped
it is quite cool  said gandalf  take it  frodo received it on his
shrinking palm it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
 hold it up  said gandalf  and look closely 
as frodo did so he now saw fine lines finer than the finest pen strokes
running along the ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to form
the letters of a flowing script they shone piercingly bright and yet remote
as if out of a great depth

i cannot read the fiery letters  said frodo in a quavering voice
 no  said gandalf  but i can the letters are elvish of an ancient
mode but the language is that of mordor which i will not utter here but this
in the common tongue is what is said close enough
one ring to rule them all one ring to find them

one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known in elven lore
three rings for the elven kings under the sky

seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone

nine for mortal men doomed to die

one for the dark lord on his dark throne

in the land of mordor where the shadows lie

one ring to rule them all one ring to find them

one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

in the land of mordor where the shadows lie 
he paused and then said slowly in a deep voice  this is the master ring
the one ring to rule them all this is the one ring that he lost many ages ago
to the great weakening of his power he greatly desires it   but he must not
get it 
frodo sat silent and motionless fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like
a dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulf him  this ring 
he stammered  how how on earth did it come to me 
 ah  said gandalf  that is a very long story the beginnings lie back
in the black years which only the lore masters now remember if i were to tell
you all that tale we should still be sitting here when spring had passed into
winter
 but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord the rumours
that you have heard are true he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in
mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor that
name even you hobbits have heard of like a shadow on the borders of old
stories always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes another shape and
grows again 
 i wish it need not have happened in my time  said frodo
 so do i  said gandalf  and so do all who live to see such times but
that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the
time that is given us and already frodo our time is beginning to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very strong his plans are far from ripe i think
but they are ripening we shall be hard put to it we should be very hard put to
it even if it were not for this dreadful chance
 the enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat
down all resistance break the last defences and cover all the lands in a
second darkness he lacks the one ring
 the three fairest of all the elf lords hid from him and his hand never
touched them or sullied them seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has
recovered and the others the dragons have consumed nine he gave to mortal men
proud and great and so ensnared them long ago they fell under the dominion of
the one and they became ringwraiths shadows under his great shadow his most
terrible servants long ago it is many a year since the nine walked abroad yet
who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again but come we
will not speak of such things even in the morning of the shire
 so it is now the nine he has gathered to himself the seven also or else
they are destroyed the three are hidden still but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring himself it is his and he let a
great part of his own former power pass into it so that he could rule all the
others if he recovers it then he will command them all again wherever they
be even the three and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare
and he will be stronger than ever
 and this is the dreadful chance frodo he believed that the one had
perished that the elves had destroyed it as should have been done but he
knows now that it has not perished that it has been found so he is
seeking it seeking it and all his thought is bent on it it is his great hope
and our great fear 
 why why wasn t it destroyed  cried frodo  and how did the enemy
ever come to lose it if he was so strong and it was so precious to him  he
clutched the ring in his hand as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out
to seize it
 it was taken from him  said gandalf  the strength of the elves to
resist him was greater long ago and not all men were estranged from them the
men of westernesse came to their aid that is a chapter of ancient history which
it might be good to recall for there was sorrow then too and gathering dark
but great valour and great deeds that were not wholly vain one day perhaps i
will tell you all the tale or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows
it best
 but for the moment since most of all you need to know how this thing came
to you and that will be tale enough this is all that i will say it was
gil galad elven king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew sauron though
they themselves perished in the deed and isildur elendil s son cut the ring
from sauron s hand and took it for his own then sauron was vanquished and his
spirit fled and was hidden for long years until his shadow took shape again in
mirkwood
 but the ring was lost it fell into the great river anduin and vanished
for isildur was marching north along the east banks of the river and near the
gladden fields he was waylaid by the orcs of the mountains and almost all his
folk were slain he leaped into the waters but the ring slipped from his finger
as he swam and then the orcs saw him and killed him with arrows 
gandalf paused  and there in the dark pools amid the gladden fields  he
said  the ring passed out of knowledge and legend and even so much of its
history is known now only to a few and the council of the wise could discover
no more but at last i can carry on the story i think
 long after but still very long ago there lived by the banks of the great
river on the edge of wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little people
i guess they were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers of the fathers of the
stoors for they loved the river and often swam in it or made little boats of
reeds there was among them a family of high repute for it was large and
wealthier than most and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and
wise in old lore such as they had the most inquisitive and curious minded of
that family was called sméagol he was interested in roots and
beginnings he dived into deep pools he burrowed under trees and growing
plants he tunnelled into green mounds and he ceased to look up at the
hill tops or the leaves on trees or the flowers opening in the air his head
and his eyes were downward
 he had a friend called déagol of similar sort sharper eyed but
not so quick and strong on a time they took a boat and went down to the gladden
fields where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds there sméagol
got out and went nosing about the banks but déagol sat in the boat and
fished suddenly a great fish took his hook and before he knew where he was he
was dragged out and down into the water to the bottom then he let go of his
line for he thought he saw something shining in the river bed and holding his
breath he grabbed at it
 then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud
and he swam to the bank and behold when he washed the mud away there in his
hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone and glittered in the sun so that
his heart was glad but sméagol had been watching him from behind a tree
and as déagol gloated over the ring sméagol came softly up
behind
 “give us that déagol my love” said sméagol over his
friend s shoulder
 “why” said déagol
  “because it s my birthday my love and i wants it” said sméagol
 “i don t care” said déagol “i have given you a present
already more than i could afford i found this and i m going to keep it”
  “oh are you indeed my love” said sméagol and he caught déagol
by the throat and strangled him because the gold looked so bright and
beautiful then he put the ring on his finger
 no one ever found out what had become of déagol he was murdered
far from home and his body was cunningly hidden but sméagol returned
alone and he found that none of his family could see him when he was wearing
the ring he was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it and he
used it to find out secrets and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious
uses he became sharp eyed and keen eared for all that was hurtful the ring had
given him power according to his stature it is not to be wondered at that he
became very unpopular and was shunned when visible by all his relations they
kicked him and he bit their feet he took to thieving and going about
muttering to himself and gurgling in his throat so they called him gollum
and cursed him and told him to go far away and his grandmother desiring
peace expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole
 he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the hardness of the world
and he journeyed up the river till he came to a stream that flowed down from
the mountains and he went that way he caught fish in deep pools with invisible
fingers and ate them raw one day it was very hot and as he was bending over a
pool he felt a burning on the back of his head and a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet eyes he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about
the sun then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her
 but as he lowered his eyes he saw far above the tops of the misty
mountains out of which the stream came and he thought suddenly “it would be
cool and shady under those mountains the sun could not watch me there the
roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there must be great secrets
buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning”
 so he journeyed by night up into the highlands and he found a little cave
out of which the dark stream ran and he wormed his way like a maggot into the
heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge the ring went into the
shadows with him and even the maker when his power had begun to grow again
could learn nothing of it 
 gollum  cried frodo  gollum do you mean that this is the very
gollum creature that bilbo met how loathsome 
 i think it is a sad story  said the wizard  and it might have
happened to others even to some hobbits that i have known 
 i can t believe that gollum was connected with hobbits however
distantly  said frodo with some heat  what an abominable notion 
 it is true all the same  replied gandalf  about their origins at
any rate i know more than hobbits do themselves and even bilbo s story
suggests the kinship there was a great deal in the background of their minds
and memories that was very similar they understood one another remarkably well
very much better than a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an orc or
even an elf think of the riddles they both knew for one thing 
 yes  said frodo  though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and
of much the same sort and hobbits don t cheat gollum meant to cheat all the
time he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard and i daresay it
amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an
easy victim but if he lost would not hurt him 
 only too true i fear  said gandalf  but there was something else in
it i think which you don t see yet even gollum was not wholly ruined he
had proved tougher than even one of the wise would have guessed  as a hobbit
might there was a little corner of his mind that was still his own and light
came through it as through a chink in the dark light out of the past it was
actually pleasant i think to hear a kindly voice again bringing up memories
of wind and trees and sun on the grass and such forgotten things
 but that of course would only make the evil part of him angrier in the
end   unless it could be conquered unless it could be cured  gandalf sighed
 alas there is little hope of that for him yet not no hope no not though
he possessed the ring so long almost as far back as he can remember for it was
long since he had worn it much in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had never “faded” he is thin and tough still but the thing
was eating up his mind of course and the torment had become almost unbearable
 all the “great secrets” under the mountains had turned out to be just
empty night there was nothing more to find out nothing worth doing only nasty
furtive eating and resentful remembering he was altogether wretched he hated
the dark and he hated light more he hated everything and the ring most of
all 
 what do you mean  said frodo  surely the ring was his precious and
the only thing he cared for but if he hated it why didn t he get rid of it
or go away and leave it 
 you ought to begin to understand frodo after all you have heard  said
gandalf  he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself he could
not get rid of it he had no will left in the matter
 a ring of power looks after itself frodo it may slip off
treacherously but its keeper never abandons it at most he plays with the idea
of handing it on to someone else s care   and that only at an early stage
when it first begins to grip but as far as i know bilbo alone in history has
ever gone beyond playing and really done it he needed all my help too and
even so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside it was not
gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things the ring left him 
 what just in time to meet bilbo  said frodo  wouldn t an orc have
suited it better 
 it is no laughing matter  said gandalf  not for you it was the
strangest event in the whole history of the ring so far bilbo s arrival just
at that time and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
 there was more than one power at work frodo the ring was trying to get
back to its master it had slipped from isildur s hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poor déagol and he was murdered and after
that gollum and it had devoured him it could make no further use of him he
was too small and mean and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave
his deep pool again so now when its master was awake once more and sending out
his dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum only to be picked up by the
most unlikely person imaginable bilbo from the shire
 behind that there was something else at work beyond any design of the
ring maker i can put it no plainer than by saying that bilbo was meant to
find the ring and not by its maker in which case you also were meant
to have it and that maybe an encouraging thought 
it is not  said frodo “though i am not sure that i understand you but
how have you learned all this about the ring and about gollum do you really
know it all or are you just guessing still 
gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted i knew much and i have learned
much  he answered  but i am not going to give an account of all my doings
to you the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring is known to
all the wise your ring is shown to be that one ring by the fire writing alone
apart from any other evidence   and when did you discover that  asked
frodo interrupting  just now in this room of course  answered the wizard
sharply  but i expected to find it i have come back from dark journeys and
long search to make that final test it is the last proof and all is now only
too clear making out gollum s part and fitting it into the gap in the
history required some thought i may have started with guesses about gollum
but i am not guessing now i know i have seen him 
 you have seen gollum  exclaimed frodo in amazement
 yes the obvious thing to do of course if one could i tried long ago
but i have managed it at last 
 then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do you know that 
 not so clearly what i have told you is what gollum was willing to tell  
though not of course in the way i have reported it gollum is a liar and you
have to sift his words for instance he called the ring his “birthday
present” and he stuck to that he said it came from his grandmother who had
lots of beautiful things of that kind a ridiculous story i have no doubt that
sméagols grandmother was a matriarch a great person in her way but to
talk of her possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for giving them away
it was a lie but a lie with a grain of truth
 the murder of déagol haunted gollum and he had made up a defence
repeating it to his “precious” over and over again as he gnawed bones in
the dark until he almost believed it it was his birthday déagol
ought to have given the ring to him it had previously turned up just so as to
be a present it was his birthday present and so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the truth was desperately important
and in the end i had to be harsh i put the fear of fire on him and wrung the
true story out of him bit by bit together with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill used but when he had at last told me
his history as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbo s escape he would
not say any more except in dark hints some other fear was on him greater than
mine he muttered that he was going to gel his own back people would see if he
would stand being kicked and driven into a hole and then robbed gollum
had good friends now good friends and very strong they would help him baggins
would pay for it that was his chief thought he hated bilbo and cursed his
name what is more he knew where he came from 
 but how did he find that out  asked frodo
 well as for the name bilbo very foolishly told gollum himself and after
that it would not be difficult to discover his country once gollum came out oh
yes he came out his longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear of the
orcs or even of the light after a year or two he left the mountains you see
though still bound by desire of it the ring was no longer devouring him he
began to revive a little he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was
mortally hungry
 light light of sun and moon he still feared and hated and he always
will i think but he was cunning he found he could hide from daylight and
moonshine and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale
cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary things he grew stronger and
bolder with new food and new air he found his way into mirkwood as one would
expect 
 is that where you found him  asked frodo
 i saw him there  answered gandalf  but before that he had wandered
far following bilbo s trail it was difficult to learn anything from him for
certain for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats “what
had it got in its pocketses” he said “it wouldn t say no precious
little cheat not a fair question it cheated first it did it broke the rules
we ought to have squeezed it yes precious and we will precious”
 that is a sample of his talk i don t suppose you want any more i had
weary days of it but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered that
his padding feet had taken him at last to esgaroth and even to the streets of
dale listening secretly and peering well the news of the great events went
far and wide in wilderland and many had heard bilbo s name and knew where he
came from we had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the west
gollum s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted 
 then why didn t he track bilbo further  asked frodo  why didn t
he come to the shire 
 ah  said gandalf  now we come to it i think gollum tried to he set
out and came back westward as far as the great river but then he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure no something else drew him away
so my friends think those that hunted him for me
 the wood elves tracked him first an easy task for them for his trail was
still fresh then through mirkwood and back again it led them though they never
caught him the wood was full of the rumour of him dreadful tales even among
beasts and birds the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad a
ghost that drank blood it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes to
find the young it slipped through windows to find cradles
 but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away it wandered off
southwards and passed out of the wood elves  ken and was lost and then i
made a great mistake yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove
the worst i let the matter be i let him go for i had much else to think of at
that time and i still trusted the lore of saruman
 well that was years ago i have paid for it since with many dark and
dangerous days the trail was long cold when i took it up again after bilbo
left here and my search would have been in vain but for the help that i had
from a friend aragorn the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the
world together we sought for gollum down the whole length of wilderland
without hope and without success but at last when i had given up the chase
and turned to other parts gollum was found my friend returned out of the great
perils bringing the miserable creature with him
 what he had been doing he would not say he only wept and called us cruel
with many a gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he whined and
cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his fingers as if they pained him
as if he remembered some old torture but i am afraid there is no possible
doubt he had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile by mile south
down at last to the land of mordor 
a heavy silence fell in the room frodo could hear his heart beating even
outside everything seemed still no sound of sam s shears could now be heard
 yes to mordor  said gandalf  alas mordor draws all wicked things
and the dark power was bending all its will to gather them there the ring of
the enemy would leave its mark too leave him open to the summons and all folk
were whispering then of the new shadow in the south and its hatred of the west
there were his fine new friends who would help him in his revenge
 wretched fool in that land he would learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught
and taken   for examination that was the way of it i fear when he was found
he had already been there long and was on his way back on some errand of
mischief but that does not matter much now his worst mischief was done
 yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the one has been found
again he knows where isildur fell he knows where gollum found his ring he
knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life he knows that it is not
one of the three for they have never been lost and they endure no evil he
knows that it is not one of the seven or the nine for they are accounted for
he knows that it is the one and he has at last heard i think of hobbits
and the shire
 the shire   he may be seeking for it now if he has not already found out
where it lies indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that the
long unnoticed name of baggins has become important 
 but this is terrible  cried frodo  far worse than the worst that i
imagined from your hints and warnings o gandalf best of friends what am i to
do for now i am really afraid what am i to do what a pity that bilbo did not
stab that vile creature when he had a chance 
 pity it was pity that stayed his hand pity and mercy not to strike
without need and he has been well rewarded frodo be sure that he took so
little hurt from the evil and escaped in the end because he began his
ownership of the ring so with pity 
 i am sorry  said frodo  but i am frightened and i do not feel any
pity for gollum 
 you have not seen him  gandalf broke in
 no and i don t want to  said frodo i can t understand you do you
mean to say that you and the elves have let him live on after all those
horrible deeds now at any rate he is as bad as an orc and just an enemy he
deserves death 
 deserves it i daresay he does many that live deserve death and some
that die deserve life can you give it to them then do not be too eager to deal
out death in judgement for even the very wise cannot see all ends i have not
much hope that gollum can be cured before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring my heart tells me that he has some
part to play yet for good or ill before the end and when that comes the pity
of bilbo may rule the fate of many   yours not least in any case we did not
kill him he is very old and very wretched the wood elves have him in prison
but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts 
 all the same  said frodo  even if bilbo could not kill gollum i
wish he had not kept the ring i wish he had never found it and that i had not
got it why did you let me keep it why didn t you make me throw it away or
or destroy it 
 let you make you  said the wizard  haven t you been listening to
all that i have said you are not thinking of what you are saying but as for
throwing it away that was obviously wrong these rings have a way of being
found in evil hands it might have done great evil worst of all it might have
fallen into the hands of the enemy indeed it certainly would for this is the
one and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself
 of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you and that has troubled
me deeply but there was so much at stake that i had to take some risk   though
even when i was far away there has never been a day when the shire has not been
guarded by watchful eyes as long as you never used it i did not think that the
ring would have any lasting effect on you not for evil not at any rate for a
very long time and you must remember that nine years ago when i last saw you
i still knew little for certain 
 but why not destroy it as you say should have been done long ago 
cried frodo again if you had warned me or even sent me a message i would have
done away with it 
 would you how would you do that have you ever tried 
 no but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it 
 try  said gandalf try now 
frodo drew the ring out of his pocket again and looked at it it now appeared
plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see the gold looked very
fair and pure and frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour how
perfect was its roundness it was an admirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest
part of the fire but he found now that he could not do so not without a great
struggle he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating and forcing himself to
remember all that gandalf had told him and then with an effort of will he made
a movement as if to cast it away   but he found that he had put it back in his
pocket
gandalf laughed grimly  you see already you too frodo cannot easily let
it go nor will to damage it and i could not “make” you   except by force
which would break your mind but as for breaking the ring force is useless
even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge hammer it would make no
dint in it it cannot be unmade by your hands or by mine
 your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold this ring
has already passed through it unscathed and even unheated but there is no
smith s forge in this shire that could change it at all not even the anvils
and furnaces of the dwarves could do that it has been said that dragon fire
could melt and consume the rings of power but there is not now any dragon left
on earth in which the old fire is hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not
even ancalagon the black who could have harmed the one ring the ruling ring
for that was made by sauron himself there is only one way to find the cracks
of doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and cast the ring in
there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy
for ever 
 i do really wish to destroy it  cried frodo  or well to have it
destroyed i am not made for perilous quests i wish i had never seen the ring
why did it come to me why was i chosen 
 such questions cannot be answered  said gandalf  you may be sure
that it was not for any merit that others do not possess not for power or
wisdom at any rate but you have been chosen and you must therefore use such
strength and heart and wits as you have 
 but i have so little of any of these things you are wise and powerful
will you not take the ring 
 no  cried gandalf springing to his feet  with that power i should
have power too great and terrible and over me the ring would gain a power still
greater and more deadly  his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire
within  do not tempt me for i do not wish to become like the dark lord
himself yet the way of the ring to my heart is by pity pity for weakness and
the desire of strength to do good do not tempt me i dare not take it not even
to keep it safe unused the wish to wield it would be too great for my
strength i shall have such need of it great perils lie before me 
he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters sunlight
streamed back again into the room sam passed along the path outside whistling
 and now  said the wizard turning back to frodo  the decision lies with
you but i will always help you  he laid his hand on frodo s shoulder  i
will help you bear this burden as long as it is yours to bear but we must do
something soon the enemy is moving 
there was a long silence gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as
if lost in thought his eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watching
frodo intently frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth until they
filled all his vision and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of
fire he was thinking of the fabled cracks of doom and the terror of the fiery
mountain
 well  said gandalf at last  what are you thinking about have you
decided what to do 
 no  answered frodo coming back to himself out of darkness and finding
to his surprise that it was not dark and that out of the window he could see
the sunlit garden  or perhaps yes as far as i understand what you have
said i suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at least for the present
whatever it may do to me 
 whatever it may do it will be slow slow to evil if you keep it with
that purpose  said gandalf
 i hope so  said frodo  but i hope that you may find some other
better keeper soon but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger a danger
to all that live near me i cannot keep the ring and stay here i ought to leave
bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away  he sighed
 i should like to save the shire if i could   though there have been times
when i thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and have felt that
an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them but i don t
feel like that now i feel that as long as the shire lies behind safe and
comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i shall know that somewhere
there is a firm foothold even if my feet cannot stand there again
 of course i have sometimes thought of going away but i imagined that as
a kind of holiday a series of adventures like bilbo s or better ending in
peace but this would mean exile a flight from danger into danger drawing it
after me and i suppose i must go alone if i am to do that and save the shire
but i feel very small and very uprooted and well   desperate the enemy is so
strong and terrible 
he did not tell gandalf but as he was speaking a great desire to follow
bilbo flamed up in his heart   to follow bilbo and even perhaps to find him
again it was so strong that it overcame his fear he could almost have run out
there and then down the road without his hat as bilbo had done on a similar
morning long ago
 my dear frodo  exclaimed gandalf  hobbits really are amazing
creatures as i have said before you can learn all that there is to know about
their ways in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you
at a pinch i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you but
bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir though he little thought how
important it would prove i am afraid you are right the ring will not be able
to stay hidden in the shire much longer and for your own sake as well as for
others you will have to go and leave the name of baggins behind you that name
will not be safe to have outside the shire or in the wild i will give you a
travelling name now when you go go as mr underhill
 but i don t think you need go alone not if you know of anyone you can
trust and who would be willing to go by your side   and that you would be
willing to take into unknown perils but if you look for a companion be careful
in choosing and be careful of what you say even to your closest friends the
enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing 
suddenly he stopped as if listening frodo became aware that all was very
quiet inside and outside gandalf crept to one side of the window then with a
dart he sprang to the sill and thrust a long arm out and downwards there was a
squawk and up came sam gamgee s curly head hauled by one ear
 well well bless my beard  said gandalf  sam gamgee is it now what
may you be doing 
 lor bless you mr gandalf sir  said sam  nothing leastways i was
just trimming the grass border under the window if you follow me  he picked
up his shears and exhibited them as evidence
 i don t  said gandalf grimly it is some time since i last heard the
sound of your shears how long have you been eavesdropping 
 eavesdropping sir i don t follow you begging your pardon there
ain t no eaves at bag end and that s a fact 
 don t be a fool what have you heard and why did you listen 
gandalf s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles
 mr frodo sir  cried sam quaking  don t let him hurt me sir
don t let him turn me into anything unnatural my old dad would take on so i
meant no harm on my honour sir 
 he won t hurt you  said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himself startled and rather puzzled  he knows as well as i
do that you mean no harm but just you up and answer his questions straight
away 
 well sir  said sam dithering a little  i heard a deal that i
didn t rightly understand about an enemy and rings and mr bilbo sir and
dragons and a fiery mountain and   and elves sir i listened because i
couldn t help myself if you know what i mean lor bless me sir but i do
love tales of that sort and i believe them too whatever ted may say elves
sir i would dearly love to see them couldn t you take me to see
elves sir when you go 
suddenly gandalf laughed  come inside  he shouted and putting out both
his arms he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
through the window and stood him on the floor  take you to see elves eh 
he said eyeing sam closely but with a smile flickering on his face  so you
heard that mr frodo is going away 
 i did sir and that s why i choked which you heard seemingly i tried
not to sir but it burst out of me i was so upset 
 it can t be helped sam  said frodo sadly he had suddenly realized
that flying from the shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying
farewell to the familiar comforts of bag end  i shall have to go but   
and here he looked hard at sam    if you really care about me you will keep
that dead secret see if you don t if you even breathe a word of what
you ve heard here then i hope gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and
fill the garden full of grass snakes 
sam fell on his knees trembling  get up sam  said gandalf i have
thought of something better than that something to shut your mouth and punish
you properly for listening you shall go away with mr frodo 
 me sir  cried sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk  me
go and see elves and all hooray  he shouted and then burst into tears
 
 you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon  said gandalf two or
three weeks had passed and still frodo made no sign of getting ready to go
 i know but it is difficult to do both  he objected if i just vanish
like bilbo the tale will be all over the shire in no time 
 of course you mustn t vanish  said gandalf  that wouldn t do at
all i said soon not instantly if you can think of any way of
slipping out of the shire without its being generally known it will be worth a
little delay but you must not delay too long 
 what about the autumn on or after our birthday  asked frodo  i
think i could probably make some arrangements by then 
to tell the truth he was very reluctant to start now that it had come to
the point bag end seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years and
he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the shire when
autumn came he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of
journeying as it always did at that season he had indeed privately made up his
mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday bilbo s one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him following
bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one thing that made the thought of
leaving bearable he thought as little as possible about the ring and where it
might lead him in the end but he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalf what
the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at frodo and smiled  very well  he said  i think that will
do   but it must not be any later i am getting very anxious in the mean while
do take care and don t let out any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk if he does i really shall turn him into a toad 
 as for where i am going  said frodo  it would be difficult to
give that away for i have no clear idea myself yet 
 don t be absurd  said gandalf  i am not warning you against
leaving an address at the post office but you are leaving the shire   and that
should not be known until you are far away and you must go or at least set
out either north south west or east   and the direction should certainly not
be known 
 i have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving bag end and of
saying farewell that i have never even considered the direction  said frodo
 for where am i to go and by what shall i steer what is to be my quest
bilbo went to find a treasure there and back again but i go to lose one and
not return as far as i can see 
 but you cannot see very far  said gandalf  neither can i it may be
your task to find the cracks of doom but that quest may be for others i do not
know at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet 
 no indeed  said frodo  but in the meantime what course am i to
lake 
 towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight  answered the
wizard  if you want my advice make for rivendell that journey should not
prove too perilous though the road is less easy than it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails 
 rivendell  said frodo  very good i will go east and i will make
for rivendell i will take sam to visit the elves he will be delighted  he
spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house
of elrond halfelven and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the
fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summer s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the ivy bush
and green dragon giants and other portents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling bag end indeed
he had already sold it   to the sackville bagginses
 for a nice bit loo  said some  at a bargain price  said others
 and that s more likely when mistress lobelia s the buyer  otho had
died some years before at the ripe but disappointed age of 102
just why mr frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable
than the price a few held the theory   supported by the nods and hints of mr
baggins himself   that frodo s money was running out he was going to leave
hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in buckland
among his brandybuck relations  as far from the sackville bagginses as may
be  some added but so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth
of the bagginses of bag end become that most found this hard to believe harder
than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf though he kept himself very
quiet and did not go about by day it was well known that he was  hiding up in
the bag end  but however a removal might fit in with the designs of his
wizardry there was no doubt about the fact frodo baggins was going back to
buckland
 yes i shall be moving this autumn  he said  merry brandybuck is
looking out for a nice little hole for me or perhaps a small house 
as a matter of fact with merry s help he had already chosen and bought a
little house at crickhollow in the country beyond bucklebury to all but sam he
pretended he was going to settle down there permanently the decision to set out
eastwards had suggested the idea to him for buckland was on the eastern borders
of the shire and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at
least seem credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months then one evening at the end
of june soon after frodo s plan had been finally arranged he suddenly
announced that he was going off again next morning  only for a short while i
hope  he said  but i am going down beyond the southern borders to get some
news if i can i have been idle longer than i should 
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried
 has anything happened  he asked
 well no but i have heard something that has made me anxious and needs
looking into if i think it necessary after all for you to get off at once i
shall come back immediately or at least send word in the meanwhile stick to
your plan but be more careful than ever especially of the ring let me impress
on you once more don t use it 
he went off at dawn  i may be back any day  he said  at the very
latest i shall come back for the farewell party i think after all you may need
my company on the road 
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and wondered often what gandalf
could have heard but his uneasiness wore off and in the fine weather he forgot
his troubles for a while the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or so rich
an autumn the trees were laden with apples honey was dripping in the combs
and the corn was tall and full
autumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf again
september was passing and there was still no news of him the birthday and the
removal drew nearer and still he did not come or send word bag end began to
be busy some of frodo s friends came to stay and help him with the packing
there was fredegar bolger and folco boffin and of course his special friends
pippin took and merry brandybuck between them they turned the whole place
upside down
on september 20th two covered carts went off laden to buckland conveying the
furniture and goods that frodo had not sold to his new home by way of the
brandywine bridge the next day frodo became really anxious and kept a constant
look out for gandalf thursday his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear
as it had long ago for bilbo s great party still gandalf did not appear in
the evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was quite small just a dinner for
himself and his four helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it
the thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on
his heart he wondered how he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were however in high spirits and the party soon
became very cheerful in spite of gandalf s absence the dining room was bare
except for a table and chairs but the food was good and there was good wine
frodo s wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville bagginses
 whatever happens to the rest of my stuff when the s bs get their claws
on it at any rate i have found a good home for this  said frodo as he
drained his glass it was the last drop of old winyards
when they had sung many songs and talked of many things they had done
together they toasted bilbo s birthday and they drank his health and
frodo s together according to frodo s custom then they went out for a sniff
of air and glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed frodo s party was
over and gandalf had not come
the next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of
the luggage merry took charge of this and drove off with fatty that is
fredegar bolger  someone must get there and warm the house before you
arrive  said merry  well see you later   the day after tomorrow if you
don t go to sleep on the way 
folco went home after lunch but pippin remained behind frodo was restless
and anxious listening in vain for a sound of gandalf he decided to wait until
nightfall after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go to
crickhollow and might even get there first for frodo was going on foot his
plan   for pleasure and a last look at the shire as much as any other reason  
was to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
 i shall get myself a bit into training too  he said looking at
himself in a dusty mirror in the half empty hall he had not done any strenuous
walking for a long time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and her sandy haired son
lotho turned up much to frodo s annoyance  ours at last  said lobelia
as she stepped inside it was not polite nor strictly true for the sale of bag
end did not take effect until midnight but lobelia can perhaps be forgiven she
had been obliged to wait about seventy seven years longer for bag end than she
once hoped and she was now a hundred years old anyway she had come to see
that nothing she had paid for had been carried off and she wanted the keys it
took a long while to satisfy her as she had brought a complete inventory with
her and went right through it in the end she departed with lotho and the spare
key and the promise that the other key would be left at the gamgees  in
bagshot row she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during the night frodo did not offer her any
tea
he took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen it had been
officially announced that sam was coming to buckland  to do for mr frodo and
look after his bit of garden  an arrangement that was approved by the gaffer
though it did not console him for the prospect of having lobelia as a neighbour
 our last meal at bag end  said frodo pushing back his chair they left
the washing up for lobelia pippin and sam strapped up their three packs and
piled them in the porch pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden sam
disappeared
the sun went down bag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled frodo
wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light of the sunset fade on the
walls and shadows creep out of the corners it grew slowly dark indoors he
went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a
short way down the hill road he half expected to see gandalf come striding up
through the dusk
the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright  it s going to be a
fine night  he said aloud  that s good for a beginning i feel like
walking i can t bear any more hanging about i am going to start and gandalf
must follow me  he turned to go back and then slopped for he heard voices
just round the corner by the end of bagshot row one voice was certainly the old
gaffer s the other was strange and somehow unpleasant he could not make out
what it said but he heard the gaffer s answers which were rather shrill the
old man seemed put out
 no mr baggins has gone away went this morning and my sam went with
him anyway all his stuff went yes sold out and gone i tell ee why
why s none of my business or yours where to that ain t no secret he s
moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonder yes it is   a tidy
way i ve never been so far myself they re queer folks in buckland no i
can t give no message good night to you 
footsteps went away down the hill frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that
they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief  i am sick of
questions and curiosity about my doings i suppose  he thought  what an
inquisitive lot they all are  he had half a mind to go and ask the gaffer who
the inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it and turned and walked
quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch sam was not there frodo stepped
inside the dark door  sam  he called  sam time 
 coming sir  came the answer from far within followed soon by sam
himself wiping his mouth he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in the
cellar
 all aboard sam  said frodo
 yes sir i ll last for a bit now sir 
frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to sam  run down
with this to your home sam  he said  then cut along the row and meet us
as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows we are not going
through the village tonight too many ears pricking and eyes prying  sam ran
off at full speed
 well now we re off at last  said frodo they shouldered their packs
and took up their sticks and walked round the corner to the west side of bag
end  good bye  said frodo looking at the dark blank windows he waved his
hand and then turned and following bilbo if he had known it hurried after
peregrin down the garden path they jumped over the low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the fields passing into the darkness like a rustle in
the grasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate opening
on to a narrow lane there they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy pack was
hoisted high on his shoulders and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell
bag which he called a hat in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf
 i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff  said frodo  i
pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs 
 i could take a lot more yet sir my packet is quite light  said sam
stoutly and untruthfully
 no you don t sam  said pippin  it is good for him he s got
nothing except what he ordered us to pack he s been slack lately and he ll
feel the weight less when he s walked off some of his own 
 be kind to a poor old hobbit  laughed frodo  i shall be as thin as a
willow wand i m sure before i get to buckland but i was talking nonsense i
suspect you have taken more than your share sam and i shall look into it at
our next packing  he picked up his stick again  well we all like walking
in the dark  he said  so let s put some miles behind us before bed 
for a short way they followed the lane westwards then leaving it they turned
left and took quietly to the fields again they went in single file along
hedgerows and the borders of coppices and night fell dark about them in their
dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings since they
were all hobbits and were trying to be silent they made no noise that even
hobbits would hear even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed
their passing
after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow
plank bridge the stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon bordered
with leaning alder trees a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the
great road from the brandywine bridge they were now in the tookland and bending
south eastwards they made for the green hill country as they began to climb its
first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling in
the gentle valley of the water soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened
land and was followed by bywater beside its grey pool when the light of the
last farm was far behind peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand
in farewell
 i wonder if i shall ever look down into that valley again  he said
quietly
when they had walked for about three hours they rested the night was clear
cool and starry but smoke like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill sides
from the streams and deep meadows thin clad birches swaying in a light wind
above their heads made a black net against the pale sky they ate a very frugal
supper for hobbits and then went on again soon they struck a narrow road
that went rolling up and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road to
woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry it climbed away from the main
road in the water valley and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that
rustled their dry leaves in the night it was very dark at first they talked
or hummed a tune softly together being now far away from inquisitive ears then
they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag behind at last as they
began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
 i am so sleepy  he said  that soon i shall fall down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight 
 i thought you liked walking in the dark  said frodo  but there is no
great hurry merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but that leaves
us nearly two days more we ll halt at the first likely spot 
 the wind s in the west  said sam  if we get to the other side of
this hill we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough sir there is
a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly  sam knew the land well
within twenty miles of hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography
just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wood leaving the
road they went into the deep resin scented darkness of the trees and gathered
dead sticks and cones to make a fire soon they had a merry crackle of flame at
the foot of a large fir tree and they sat round it for a while until they began
to nod then each in an angle of the great tree s roots they curled up in
their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep they set no watch even
frodo feared no danger yet for they were still in the heart of the shire a few
creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away a fox passing
through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed
 hobbits  he thought  well what next i have heard of strange doings
in this land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a
tree three of them there s something mighty queer behind this  he was
quite right but he never found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clammy frodo woke up first and found that a
tree root had made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
 walking for pleasure why didn t i drive  he thought as he usually
did at the beginning of an expedition  and all my beautiful feather beds are
sold to the sackville bagginses these tree roots would do them good  he
stretched  wake up hobbits  he cried it s a beautiful morning 
 what s beautiful about it  said pippin peering over the edge of his
blanket with one eye  sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have you
got the bath water hot 
sam jumped up looking rather bleary  no sir i haven t sir  he
said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over and then walked
off to the edge of the wood away eastward the sun was rising red out of the
mists that lay thick on the world touched with gold and red the autumn trees
seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea a little below him to the left
the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared
when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire going  water 
shouted pippin  where s the water 
 i don t keep water in my pockets  said frodo  we thought you had
gone to find some  said pippin busy setting out the food and cups  you
had better go now 
 you can come too  said frodo  and bring all the water bottles 
there was a stream at the foot of the hill they filled their bottles and the
small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an
outcrop of grey stone it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as they
bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their packs all trussed up again it was
after ten o clock and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot they went
down the slope and across the stream where it dived under the road and up the
next slope and up and down another shoulder of the hills and by that time
their cloaks blankets water food and other gear already seemed a heavy
burden
the day s march promised to be warm and tiring work after some miles
however the road ceased to roll up and down it climbed to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sort of way and then prepared to go down for the
last time in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of
trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze they were
looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river the road wound away
before them like a piece of string
 the road goes on for ever  said pippin  but i can t without a
rest it is high time for lunch  he sat down on the bank at the side of the
road and looked away east into the haze beyond which lay the river and the end
of the shire in which he had spent all his life sam stood by him his round
eyes were wide open   for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new
horizon
 do elves live in those woods  he asked
 not that i ever heard  said pippin frodo was silent he too was gazing
eastward along the road as if he had never seen it before suddenly he spoke
aloud but as if to himself saying slowly
the road goes ever on and on

down from the door where it began

now far ahead the road has gone

and i must follow if i can

pursuing it with weary feet

until it joins some larger way

where many paths and errands meet

and whither then i cannot say
 that sounds like a bit of old bilbo s rhyming  said pippin  or is
it one of your imitations it does not sound altogether encouraging 
 i don t know  said frodo it came to me then as if i was making it
up but i may have heard it long ago certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo
in the last years before he went away he used often to say there was only one
road that it was like a great river its springs were at every doorstep and
every path was its tributary “it s a dangerous business frodo going out
of your door” he used to say “you step into the road and if you don t
keep your feet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to do you
realize that this is the very path that goes through mirkwood and that if you
let it it might take you to the lonely mountain or even further and to worse
places” he used to say that on the path outside the front door at bag end
especially after he had been out for a long walk 
 well the road won t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least  said
pippin unslinging his pack the others followed his example putting their
packs against the bank and their legs out into the road after a rest they had a
good lunch and then more rest
the sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land
as they went down the hill so far they had not met a soul on the road this way
was not much used being hardly fit for carts and there was little traffic to
the woody end they had been jogging along again for an hour or more when sam
stopped a moment as if listening they were now on level ground and the road
after much winding lay straight ahead through grass land sprinkled with tall
trees outliers of the approaching woods
 i can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind  said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far
 i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us  said frodo but even as he
said it he had a feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire to hide from
the view of the rider came over him
 it may not matter much  he said apologetically  but i would rather
not be seen on the road   by anyone i am sick of my doings being noticed and
discussed and if it is gandalf  he added as an afterthought  we can give
him a little surprise to pay him out for being so late let s get out of
sight 
the other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far
from the road there they lay flat frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or
some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide the sound of hoofs
drew nearer just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind
a tree that overshadowed the road then he lifted his head and peered cautiously
above one of the great roots
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but a full sized horse
and on it sat a large man who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed
below his face was shadowed and invisible
when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped the
riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening from inside
the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head
turned from side to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo and he thought of
his ring he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to get it out of his
pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand he felt that he
had only to slip it on and then he would be safe the advice of gandalf seemed
absurd bilbo had used the ring  and i am still in the shire  he thought
as his hand touched the chain on which it hung at that moment the rider sat up
and shook the reins the horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and
then breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider until he
dwindled into the distance he could not be quite sure but it seemed to him
that suddenly before it passed out of sight the horse turned aside and went
into the trees on the right
 well i call that very queer and indeed disturbing  said frodo to
himself as he walked towards his companions pippin and sam had remained flat
in the grass and had seen nothing so frodo described the rider and his strange
behaviour
 i can t say why but i felt certain he was looking or smelling
for me and also i felt certain that i did not want him to discover me i ve
never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before 
 but what has one of the big people got to do with us  said pippin
 and what is he doing in this part of the world 
 there are some men about  said frodo  down in the southfarthing they
have had trouble with big people i believe but i have never heard of anything
like this rider i wonder where he comes from 
 begging your pardon  put in sam suddenly  i know where he comes
from it s from hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless there s
more than one and i know where he s going to 
 what do you mean  said frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment
 why didn t you speak up before 
 i have only just remembered sir it was like this when i got back to our
hole yesterday evening with the key my dad he says to me hello sam
he says i thought you were away with mr frodo this morning there s been
a strange customer asking for mr baggins of bag end and he s only just gone
i ve sent him on to bucklebury not that i liked the sound of him he seemed
mighty put out when i told him mr baggins had left his old home for good
hissed at me he did it gave me quite a shudder what sort of a fellow was he
says i to the gaffer i don t know says he but he wasn t
a hobbit he was tall and black like and he stooped aver me i reckon it was
one of the big folk from foreign parts he spoke funny
 i couldn t stay to hear more sir since you were waiting and i
didn t give much heed to it myself the gaffer is getting old and more than a
bit blind and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the hill and
found him taking the air at the end of our row i hope he hasn t done no harm
sir nor me 
 the gaffer can t be blamed anyway  said frodo  as a matter of fact
i heard him talking to a stranger who seemed to be inquiring for me and i
nearly went and asked him who it was i wish i had or you had told me about it
before i might have been more careful on the road 
 still there may be no connexion between this rider and the gaffer s
stranger  said pippin  we left hobbiton secretly enough and i don t see
how he could have followed us 
 what about the smelling sir  said sam  and the gaffer said
he was a black chap 
 i wish i had waited for gandalf  frodo muttered  but perhaps it
would only have made matters worse 
 then you know or guess something about this rider  said pippin who had
caught the muttered words
 i don t know and i would rather not guess  said frodo  all right
cousin frodo you can keep your secret for the present if you want to be
mysterious in the meanwhile what are we to do i should like a bite and a sup
but somehow i think we had better move on from here your talk of sniffing
riders with invisible noses has unsettled me 
 yes i think we will move on now  said frodo  but not on the road
 in case that rider comes back or another follows him we ought to do a good
step more today buckland is still miles away 
the shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass as they started off
again they now kept a stone s throw to the left of the road and kept out of
sight of it as much as they could but this hindered them for the grass was
thick and tussocky and the ground uneven and the trees began to draw together
into thickets
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs and evening was
coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over
which it had run straight for some miles at that point it bent left and went
down into the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a lane branched right
winding through a wood of ancient oak trees on its way to woodhall  that is
the way for us  said frodo
not far from the road meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree it was
still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the
broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it was hollow and could be entered
by a great crack on the side away from the road the hobbits crept inside and
sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood they rested and had a
light meal talking quietly and listening from time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane the west wind was
sighing in the branches leaves were whispering soon the road began to fall
gently but steadily into the dusk a star came out above the trees in the
darkening east before them they went abreast and in step to keep up their
spirits after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter the feeling of
disquiet left them and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs they
began to hum softly as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along
especially when they are drawing near to home at night with most hobbits it is
a supper song or a bed song but these hobbits hummed a walking song though
not of course without any mention of supper and bed bilbo baggins had made
the words to a tune that was as old as the hills and taught it to frodo as
they walked in the lanes of the water valley and talked about adventure
upon the hearth the fire is red

beneath the roof there is a bed

but not yet weary are our feet

still round the corner we may meet

a sudden tree or standing stone

that none have seen but we alone

tree and flower and leaf and grass

let them pass let them pass

hill and water under sky

pass them by pass them by



still round the corner there may wait

a new road or a secret gate

and though we pass them by today

tomorrow we may come this way

and take the hidden paths that run

towards the moon or to the sun

apple thorn and nut and sloe

let them go let them go

sand and stone and pool and dell

fare you well fare you well



home is behind the world ahead

and there are many paths to tread

through shadows to the edge of night

until the stars are all alight

then world behind and home ahead

we ll wander back to home and bed

mist and twilight cloud and shade

away shall fade away shall fade

fire and lamp and meat and bread

and then to bed and then to bed
the song ended  and now to bed and now to bed  sang
pippin in a high voice
 hush  said frodo  i think i hear hoofs again 
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree shadows listening there
was a sound of hoofs in the lane some way behind but coming slow and clear
down the wind quickly and quietly they slipped off the path and ran into the
deeper shade under the oak trees
 don t let us go too far  said frodo  i don t want to be seen
but i want to see if it is another black rider 
 very well  said pippin  but don t forget the sniffing 
the hoofs drew nearer they had no time to find any hiding place better than
the general darkness under the trees sam and pippin crouched behind a large
tree bole while frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane it showed grey
and pale a line of fading light through the wood above it the stars were thick
in the dim sky but there was no moon
the sound of hoofs stopped as frodo watched he saw something dark pass
across the lighter space between two trees and then halt it looked like the
black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow the black shadow stood
close to the point where they had left the path and it swayed from side to
side frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling the shadow bent to the
ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slip on the ring came over frodo but this time it
was stronger than before so strong that almost before he realized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his pocket but at that moment there came a sound
like mingled song and laughter clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air
the black shadow straightened up and retreated it climbed on to the shadowy
horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side
frodo breathed again
 elves  exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper  elves sir  he would
have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices if they had not
pulled him back
 yes it is elves  said frodo  one can meet them sometimes in the
woody end they don t live in the shire but they wander into it in spring and
autumn out of their own lands away beyond the tower hills i am thankful that
they do you did not see but that black rider stopped just here and was
actually crawling towards us when the song began as soon as he heard the voices
he slipped away 
 what about the elves  said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
 can t we go and see them 
 listen they are coming this way  said frodo  we have only to
wait  the singing drew nearer one clear voice rose now above the others it
was singing in the fair elven tongue of which frodo knew only a little and the
others knew nothing yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape
itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood this was
the song as frodo heard it
snow white snow white o lady clear

o queen beyond the western seas

o light to us that wander here

amid the world of woven trees



gilthoniel o elbereth

clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath

snow white snow white we sing to thee

in a far land beyond the sea



o stars that in the sunless year

with shining hand by her were sawn

in windy fields now bright and clear

we see your silver blossom blown



o elbereth gilthoniel

we still remember we who dwell

in this far land beneath the trees

thy starlight on the western seas
the song ended  these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth 
said frodo in amazement  few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the shire
not many now remain in middle earth east of the great sea this is indeed a
strange chance 
the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside before long the elves came down the
lane towards the valley they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the
starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes they bore no lights yet
as they walked a shimmer like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills
before it rises seemed to fall about their feet they were now silent and as
the last elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed
 hail frodo  he cried  you are abroad late or are you perhaps
lost  then he called aloud to the others and all the company stopped and
gathered round
 this is indeed wonderful  they said  three hobbits in a wood at
night we have not seen such a thing since bilbo went away what is the meaning
of it 
 the meaning of it fair people  said frodo  is simply that we seem
to be going the same way as you are i like walking under the stars but i would
welcome your company 
 but we have no need of other company and hobbits are so dull  they
laughed  and how do you know that we go the same way as you for you do not
know whither we are going 
 and how do you know my name  asked frodo in return
 we know many things  they said  we have seen you often before with
bilbo though you may not have seen us 
 who are you and who is your lord  asked frodo
 i am gildor  answered their leader the elf who had first hailed him
 gildor inglorion of the house of finrod we are exiles and most of our
kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while
ere we return over the great sea but some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace
in rivendell come now frodo tell us what you are doing for we see that there
is some shadow of fear upon you 
 o wise people  interrupted pippin eagerly  tell us about the black
riders 
 black riders  they said in low voices  why do you ask about black
riders 
 because two black riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
twice  said pippin  only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew
near 
the elves did not answer at once but spoke together softly in their own
tongue at length gildor turned to the hobbits  we will not speak of this
here  he said  we think you had best come now with us it is not our
custom but for this time we will lake you on our road and you shall lodge with
us tonight if you will 
 o fair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope  said pippin sam was
speechless  i thank you indeed gildor inglorion  said frodo bowing  elen
síla lúmenn  omentielvo a star shines on the hour of our
meeting  he added in the high elven speech
 be careful friends  cried gildor laughing  speak no secrets here
is a scholar in the ancient tongue bilbo was a good master hail
elf friend  he said bowing to frodo  come now with your friends and join
our company you had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray you may
be weary before we halt 
 why where are you going  asked frodo
 for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above woodhall it is some
miles but you shall have rest at the end of it and it will shorten your
journey tomorrow 
they now marched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint
lights for elves even more than hobbits could walk when they wished without
sound or footfall pippin soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a
fall sam walked along at frodo s side as if in a dream with an expression
on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy
the woods on either side became denser the trees were now younger and
thicker and as the lane went lower running down into a fold of the hills
there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand at
last the elves turned aside from the path a green ride lay almost unseen
through the thickets on the right and this they followed as it wound away back
up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out
into the lower land of the river valley suddenly they came out of the shadow of
the trees and before them lay a wide space of grass grey under the night on
three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward the ground fell steeply and
the tops of the dark trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their
feet beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars nearer at hand a
few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices they seemed to
take no further notice of the hobbits frodo and his companions wrapped
themselves in cloaks and blankets and drowsiness stole over them the night
grew on and the lights in the valley went out pippin fell asleep pillowed on
a green hillock
away high in the east swung remmirath the netted stars and slowly above the
mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire then by some shift of airs
all the mist was drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as he climbed over
the rim of the world the swordsman of the sky menelvagor with his shining
belt the elves all burst into song suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up
with a red light
 come  the elves called to the hobbits  come now is the time for
speech and merriment 
pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes he shivered  there is a fire in the
hall and food for hungry guests  said an elf standing before him
at the south end of the greensward there was an opening there the green
floor ran on into the wood and formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the
boughs of trees their great trunks ran like pillars down each side in the
middle there was a wood fire blazing and upon the tree pillars torches with
lights of gold and silver were burning steadily the elves sat round the fire
upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks some went to and fro
bearing cups and pouring drink others brought food on heaped plates and dishes
 this is poor fare  they said to the hobbits  for we are lodging in
the greenwood far from our halls if ever you are our guests at home we will
treat you better 
 it seems to me good enough for a birthday party  said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for his mind was
filled with the light upon the elf faces and the sound of voices so various and
so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream but he remembered that there was
bread surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving and
fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens he
drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain
golden as a summer afternoon
sam could never describe in words nor picture clearly to himself what he
felt or thought that night though it remained in his memory as one of the chief
events of his life the nearest he ever got was to say  well sir if i could
grow apples like that i would call myself a gardener but it was the singing
that went to my heart if you know what i mean 
frodo sat eating drinking and talking with delight but his mind was
chiefly on the words spoken he knew a little of the elf speech and listened
eagerly now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in
their own language they smiled at him and said laughing  here is a jewel
among hobbits 
after a while pippin fell fast asleep and was lifted up and borne away to a
bower under the trees there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of
the night away sam refused to leave his master when pippin had gone he came
and sat curled up at frodo s feet where at last he nodded and closed his
eyes frodo remained long awake talking with gildor
they spoke of many things old and new and frodo questioned gildor much
about happenings in the wide world outside the shire the tidings were mostly
sad and ominous of gathering darkness the wars of men and the flight of the
elves at last frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart
 tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo since he left us 
gildor smiled  yes  he answered  twice he said farewell to us on
this very spot but i saw him once again far from here  he would say no more
about bilbo and frodo fell silent
 you do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself frodo  said
gildor  but i already know a little and i can read more in your face and in
the thought behind your questions you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt
that you will find what you seek or accomplish what you intend or that you
will ever return is not that so 
 it is  said frodo  but i thought my going was a secret known only to
gandalf and my faithful sam  he looked down at sam who was snoring gently
 the secret will not reach the enemy from us  said gildor
 the enemy  said frodo  then you know why i am leaving the shire 
 i do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing you  answered
gildor  but i perceive that he is   strange indeed though that seems to me
and i warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you and upon either
side 
 you mean the riders i feared that they were servants of the enemy what are
the black riders 
 has gandalf told you nothing 
 nothing about such creatures 
 then i think it is not for me to say more   lest terror should keep you
from your journey for it seems to me that you have set out only just in time
if indeed you are in time you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn
back for the shire is no longer any protection to you 
 i cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints
and warnings  exclaimed frodo  i knew that danger lay ahead of course
but i did not expect to meet it in our own shire can t a hobbit walk from the
water to the river in peace 
 but it is not your own shire  said gildor  others dwelt here before
hobbits were and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more the
wide world is all about you you can fence yourselves in but you cannot for
ever fence it out 
 i know   and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar what can i do
now my plan was to leave the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but
now my footsteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland 
 i think you should still follow that plan  said gildor  i do not
think the road will prove too hard for your courage but if you desire clearer
counsel you should ask gandalf i do not know the reason for your flight and
therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you these
things gandalf must know i suppose that you will see him before you leave the
shire 
 i hope so but that is another thing that makes me anxious i have been
expecting gandalf for many days he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights ago but he has never appeared now i am wondering what can have
happened should i wait for him 
gildor was silent for a moment  i do not like this news  he said at
last  that gandalf should be late does not bode well but it is said do
not meddle in the affairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait 
 and it is also said  answered frodo  go not to the elves for
counsel for they will say both no and yes 
 is it indeed  laughed gildor  elves seldom give unguarded advice
for advice is a dangerous gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses
may run ill but what would you you have not told me all concerning yourself
and how then shall i choose better than you but if you demand advice i will
for friendship s sake give it i think you should now go at once without
delay and if gandalf does not come before you set out then i also advise this
do not go alone take such friends as are trusty and willing now you should be
grateful for i do not give this counsel gladly the elves have their own
labours and their own sorrows and they are little concerned with the ways of
hobbits or of any other creatures upon earth our paths cross theirs seldom by
chance or purpose in this meeting there may be more than chance but the
purpose is not clear to me and i fear to say too much 
 i am deeply grateful  said frodo  but i wish you would tell me
plainly what the black riders are if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i ought to know what is the danger that pursues me 
 is it not enough to know that they are servants of the enemy  answered
gildor  flee them speak no words to them they are deadly ask no more of
me but my heart forbodes that ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will
know more of these fell things than gildor inglorion may elbereth protect
you 
 but where shall i find courage  asked frodo  that is what i chiefly
need 
 courage is found in unlikely places  said gildor  be of good hope
sleep now in the morning we shall have gone but we will send our messages
through the lands the wandering companies shall know of your journey and those
that have power for good shall be on the watch i name you elf friend and may
the stars shine upon the end of your road seldom have we had such delight in
strangers and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speech from the lips of
other wanderers in the world 
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking  i will
sleep now  he said and the elf led him to a bower beside pippin and he
threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber
 
in the morning frodo woke refreshed he was lying in a bower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his bed was of fern and
grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant the sun was shining through the
fluttering leaves which were still green upon the tree he jumped up and went
out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood pippin was standing
studying the sky and weather there was no sign of the elves
 they have left us fruit and drink and bread  said pippin  come and
have your breakfast the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night i did
not want to leave you any but sam insisted 
frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat  what is the plan for today 
asked pippin
 to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible  answered frodo and gave
his attention to the food
 do you think we shall see anything of those riders  asked pippin
cheerfully under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them
did not seem very alarming to him
 yes probably  said frodo not liking the reminder  but i hope to
get across the river without their seeing us 
 did you find out anything about them from gildor 
 not much   only hints and riddles  said frodo evasively  did you ask
about the sniffing 
 we didn t discuss it  said frodo with his mouth full
 you should have i am sure it is very important 
 in that case i am sure gildor would have refused to explain it  said
frodo sharply  and now leave me in peace for a bit i don t want to answer
a string of questions while i am eating i want to think 
 good heavens  said pippin  at breakfast  he walked away towards
the edge of the green
from frodo s mind the bright morning   treacherously bright he thought  
had not banished the fear of pursuit and he pondered the words of gildor the
merry voice of pippin came to him he was running on the green turf and singing
 no i could not  he said to himself  it is one thing to take my
young friends walking over the shire with me until we are hungry and weary and
food and bed are sweet to take them into exile where hunger and weariness may
have no cure is quite another   even if they are willing to come the
inheritance is mine alone i don t think i ought even to take sam  he
looked at sam gamgee and discovered that sam was watching him
 well sam  he said  what about it i am leaving the shire as soon as
ever i can   in fact i have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at
crickhollow if it can be helped 
 very good sir 
 you still mean to come with me 
 i do 
 it is going to be very dangerous sam  it is already dangerous most
likely neither of us will come back 
 if you don t come back sir then i shan t that s certain  said
sam  don t you leave him they said to me leave him i said
i never mean to i am going with him if he climbs to the moon and if any of
those black rulers try to stop him they ll have sam gamgee to reckon with
i said they laughed 
 who are they and what are you talking about 
 the elves sir we had some talk last night and they seemed to know you
were going away so i didn t see the use of denying it wonderful folk elves
sir wonderful 
 they are  said frodo  do you like them still now you have had a
closer view 
 they seem a bit above my likes and dislikes so to speak  answered sam
slowly  it don t seem to matter what i think about them they are quite
different from what i expected   so old and young and so gay and sad as it
were 
frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to see some outward sign
of the odd change that seemed to have come over him it did not sound like the
voice of the old sam gamgee that he thought he knew but it looked like the old
sam gamgee sitting there except that his face was unusually thoughtful
 do you feel any need to leave the shire now   now that your wish to see
them has come true already  he asked
 yes sir i don t know how to say it but after last night i feel
different i seem to see ahead in a kind of way i know we are going to take a
very long road into darkness but i know i can t turn back it isn t to see
elves now nor dragons nor mountains that i want   i don t rightly know what
i want but i have something to do before the end and it lies ahead not in the
shire i must see it through sir if you understand me 
 i don t altogether but i understand that gandalf chose me a good
companion i am content we will go together 
frodo finished his breakfast in silence then standing up he looked over the
land ahead and called to pippin
 all ready to start  he said as pippin ran up  we must be getting off
at once we slept late and there are a good many miles to go 
 you
 i have finished both now and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as
quickly as possible i am not going out of the way back to the road we left
last night i am going to cut straight across country from here 
 then you are going to fly  said pippin  you won t cut straight on
foot anywhere in this country 
 we can cut straighter than the road anyway  answered frodo  the
ferry is east from woodhall but the hard road curves away to the left   you can
see a bend of it away north over there it goes round the north end of the
marish so as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock but that is
miles out of the way we could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line
for the ferry from where we stand 
 short cuts make long delays 
 it is less easy to find people in the woods and fields  answered frodo
 and if you are supposed to be on the road there is some chance that you will
be looked for on the road and not off it 
 all right  said pippin  i will follow you into every bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counted on passing the golden perch at stock before
sundown the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be it is a long time
since i tasted it 
 that settles it  said frodo  short cuts make delays but inns make
longer ones at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch we
want to get to bucklebury before dark what do you say sam 
 i will go along with you mr frodo  said sam in spite of private
misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
 then if we are going to toil through bog and briar let s go now 
said pippin
it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before but clouds were
beginning to come up from the west it looked likely to turn to rain the
hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees
below their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their left and to cut
slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills
until they reached the flats beyond then they could make straight for the ferry
over country that was open except for a few ditches and fences frodo reckoned
they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line
he soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had
appeared there were no paths in the undergrowth and they did not get on very
fast when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank they found a stream
running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides
overhung with brambles most inconveniently it cut across the line they had
chosen they could not jump over it nor indeed get across it at all without
getting wet scratched and muddy they halted wondering what to do  first
check  said pippin smiling grimly
sam gamgee looked back through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse
of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down
 look  he said clutching frodo by the arm they all looked and on the
edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing beside it
stooped a black figure
they at once gave up any idea of going back frodo led the way and plunged
quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream  whew  he said to pippin
 we were both right the short cut has gone crooked already but we got under
cover only just in time you ve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything
coming 
they stood still almost holding their breath as they listened but there was
no sound of pursuit  i don t fancy he would try bringing his horse down
that bank  said sam  but i guess he knows we came down it we had better
be going on 
going on was not altogether easy they had packs to carry and the bushes and
brambles were reluctant to let them through they were cut off from the wind by
the ridge behind and the air was still and stuffy when they forced their way
at last into more open ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and
they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going the
banks of the stream sank as it reached the levels and became broader and
shallower wandering off towards the marish and the river
 why this is the stock brook  said pippin  if we are going to try
and get back on to our course we must cross at once and bear right 
they waded the stream and hurried over a wide open space rush grown and
treeless on the further side beyond that they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part with here and there an elm tree or an ash the
ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowth but the trees were
loo close for them to see far ahead the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of
wind and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky then the wind died
away and the rain came streaming down they trudged along as fast as they could
over patches of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and all about
them the rain pattered and trickled they did not talk but kept glancing back
and from side to side
after half an hour pippin said  i hope we have not turned too much towards
the south and are not walking longwise through this wood it is not a very
broad belt  i should have said no more than a mile at the widest   and we ought
to have been through it by now 
 it is no good our starting to go in zig zags  said frodo  that
won t mend matters let us keep on as we are going i am not sure that i want
to come out into the open yet 
they went on for perhaps another couple of miles then the sun gleamed out of
ragged clouds again and the rain lessened it was now past mid day and they
felt it was high time for lunch they halted under an elm tree its leaves
though fast turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its feel was
fairly dry and sheltered when they came to make their meal they found that the
elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink pale golden in colour it had
the scent of a honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing very
soon they were laughing and snapping their fingers at rain and at black
riders the last few miles they felt would soon be behind them
frodo propped his back against the tree trunk and closed his eyes sam and
pippin sat near and they began to hum and then to sing softly
ho ho ho to the bottle i go

to heal my heart and drown my woe

rain may fall and wind may blow

and many miles be still to go

but under a tall tree i will lie

and let the clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho
 and what do you think that was  pippin asked at last trying to speak
lightly but quavering a little  if it was a bird it was one that i never
heard in the shire before 
 it was not bird or beast  said frodo  it was a call or a signal  
there were words in that cry though i could not catch them but no hobbit has
such a voice 
no more was said about it they were all thinking of the riders but no one
spoke of them they were now reluctant either to stay or go on but sooner or
later they had got to get across the open country to the ferry and it was best
to go sooner and in daylight in a few moments they had shouldered their packs
again and were off
before long the wood came to a sudden end wide grass lands stretched before
them they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south away
over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of bucklebury across the river
but it was now to their left creeping cautiously out from the edge of the
trees they set off across the open as quickly as they could
at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood far back behind
them stood the high place where they had breakfasted frodo half expected to see
the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but
there was no sign of one the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills they had left was now shining brightly again their fear left
them though they still felt uneasy but the land became steadily more tame and
well ordered soon they came into well tended fields and meadows there were
hedges and gates and dikes for drainage everything seemed quiet and peaceful
just an ordinary corner of the shire their spirits rose with every step the
line of the river grew nearer and the black riders began to seem like phantoms
of the woods now left far behind
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field and came to a stout gate
beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well laid hedges towards a distant clump
of trees pippin stopped
 i know these fields and this gate  he said  this is bamfurlong old
farmer maggot s land that s his farm away there in the trees 
 one trouble after another  said frodo looking nearly as much alarmed
as if pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon s den the
others looked at him in surprise
 what s wrong with old maggot  asked pippin  he s a good friend
to all the brandy bucks of course he s a terror to trespassers and keeps
ferocious dogs   but after all folk down here are near the border and have to
be more on their guard 
 i know  said frodo  but all the same  he added with a shamefaced
laugh  i am terrified of him and his dogs i have avoided his farm for years
and years he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i was a
youngster at brandy hall on the last occasion he beat me and then took me and
showed me to his dogs “see lads” he said “next time this young varmint
sets foot on my land you can eat him now see him off” they chased me all
the way to the ferry i have never got over the fright   though i daresay the
beasts knew their business and would not really have touched me 
pippin laughed  well it s time you made it up especially if you are
coming back to live in buckland old maggot is really a stout fellow   if you
leave his mushrooms alone let s get into the lane and then we shan t be
trespassing if we meet him i ll do the talking he is a friend of merry s
and i used to come here with him a good deal at one time 
they went along the lane until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house
and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead the maggots and the
puddifoots of stock and most of the inhabitants of the marish were
house dwellers and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all
round it there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out and a
loud voice was heard shouting  grip fang wolf come on lads 
frodo and sam stopped dead but pippin walked on a few paces the gate opened
and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane and dashed towards the
travellers barking fiercely they took no notice of pippin but sam shrank
against the wall while two wolvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
and snarled if he moved the largest and most ferocious of the three halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbit with a round red
face  hallo hallo and who may you be and what may you be wanting  he
asked
 good afternoon mr maggot  said pippin
the farmer looked at him closely  well if it isn t master pippin   mr
peregrin took i should say  he cried changing from a scowl to a grin
 it s a long time since i saw you round here it s lucky for you that i
know you i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers there are some
funny things going on today of course we do get queer folk wandering in these
parts at times too near the river  he said shaking his head  but this
fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on he won t cross my land
without leave a second time not if i can stop it 
 what fellow do you mean  asked pippin
 then you haven t seen him  said the farmer  he went up the lane
towards the causeway not a long while back he was a funny customer and asking
funny questions but perhaps you ll come along inside and we ll pass the
news more comfortable i ve a drop of good ale on tap if you and your friends
are willing mr took 
it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more if allowed to do it in
his own time and fashion so they all accepted the invitation  what about the
dogs  asked frodo anxiously
the farmer laughed  they won t harm you   not unless i tell  em to
here grip fang heel  he cried  heel wolf  to the relief of frodo
and sam the dogs walked away and let them go free
pippin introduced the other two to the farmer  mr frodo baggins  he
said  you may not remember him but he used to live at brandy hall  at the
name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance for a moment
frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused and that the
dogs would be told to see him off but farmer maggot took him by the arm
 well if that isn t queerer than ever  he exclaimed  mr baggins
is it come inside we must have a talk 
they went into the farmer s kitchen and sat by the wide fire place mrs
maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mugs it was a good
brew and pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the golden
perch sam sipped his beer suspiciously he had a natural mistrust of the
inhabitants of other parts of the shire and also he was not disposed to be
quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master however long ago
after a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects which
were no worse than usual farmer maggot put down his mug and looked at them all
in turn
 now mr peregrin  he said  where might you be coming from and
where might you be going to were you coming to visit  me for if so you had
gone past my gate without my seeing you 
 well no  answered pippin  to tell you the truth since you have
guessed it we got into the lane from the other end we had come over your
fields but that was quite by accident we lost our way in the woods back near
woodhall trying to take a short cut to the ferry 
 if you were in a hurry the road would have served you better  said the
farmer  but i wasn t worrying about that you have leave to walk over my
land if you have a mind mr peregrin and you mr baggins   though i daresay
you still like mushrooms  he laughed  ah yes i recognized the name i
recollect the time when young frodo baggins was one of the worst young rascals
of buckland but it wasn t mushrooms i was thinking of i had just heard the
name baggins before you turned up what do you think that funny customer asked
me 
they waited anxiously for him to go on  well  the farmer continued
approaching his point with slow relish  he came riding on a big black horse
in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door all black he
was himself too and cloaked and hooded up as if he did not want to be known
“now what in the shire can he want” i thought to myself we don t see
many of the big folk over the border and anyway i had never heard of any like
this black fellow
  “good day to you” i says going out to him “this lane don t
lead anywhere and wherever you may be going your quickest way will be back to
the road” i didn t like the looks of him and when grip came out he took
one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung he put down his tail and
bolted off howling the black fellow sat quite still
  “i come from yonder” he said slow and stiff like pointing back
west over my fields if you please “have you seen baggins”
he asked in a queer voice and bent down towards me i could not see any face
for his hood fell down so low and i felt a sort of shiver down my back but i
did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold
  “be off” i said “there are no bagginses here you re in the
wrong part of the shire you had better go back west to hobbiton   but you can
go by road this time”
  “baggins has left” he answered in a whisper “he is coming he is
not far away i wish to find him if he passes will you tell me i will come
back with gold”
  “no you won t” i said “you ll go back where you belong
double quick i give you one minute before i call all my dogs”
 he gave a sort of hiss it might have been laughing and it might not
then he spurred his great horse right at me and i jumped out of the way only
just in time i called the dogs but he swung off and rode through the gate and
up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder what do you think of
that 
frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire but his only thought was how on
earth would they reach the ferry  i don t know what to think  he said at
last
 then i ll tell you what to think  said maggot  you should never
have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo folk are queer up
there  sam stirred in his chair and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly
eye  but you were always a reckless lad when i heard you had left the
brandybucks and gone off to that old mr bilbo i said that you were going to
find trouble mark my words this all comes of those strange doings of mr
bilbo s his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels
that he buried in the hill of hobbiton as i hear 
frodo said nothing the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather
disconcerting
 well mr frodo  maggot went on  i m glad that you ve had the
sense to come back to buckland my advice is stay there and don t get mixed
up with these outlandish folk you ll have friends in these parts if any of
these black fellows come after you again i ll deal with them i ll say
you re dead or have left the shire or anything you like and that might be
true enough for as like as not it is old mr bilbo they want news of 
 maybe you re right  said frodo avoiding the farmer s eye and
staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully  well i see you have ideas of your
own  he said  it is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and
that rider here on the same afternoon and maybe my news was no great news to
you after all i am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep
to yourself but i see you are in some kind of trouble perhaps you are thinking
it won t be too easy to get to the ferry without being caught 
 i was thinking so  said frodo  but we have got to try and get there
and it won t be done by sitting and thinking so i am afraid we must be going
thank you very much indeed for your kindness i ve been in terror of you and
your dogs for over thirty years farmer maggot though you may laugh to hear it
it s a pity for i ve missed a good friend and now i m sorry to leave so
soon but i ll come back perhaps one day   if i get a chance 
 you ll be welcome when you come  said maggot  but now i ve a
notion it s near sundown already and we are going to have our supper for we
mostly go to bed soon after the sun if you and mr peregrin and all could stay
and have a bite with us we would be pleased 
 and so should we  said frodo  but we must be going at once i m
afraid even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry 
 ah but wait a minute i was going to say after a bit of supper i ll
gel out a small waggon and i ll drive you all to the ferry that will save
you a good step and it might also save you trouble of another sort 
frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippin and
sam the sun was already behind the western hills and the light was failing
two of maggot s sons and his three daughters came in and a generous supper
was laid on the large table the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was
mended mrs maggot hustled in and out one or two other hobbits belonging to
the farm household came in in a short while fourteen sat down to eat there was
beer in plenty and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon besides much other
solid farmhouse fare the dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked
bones
when they had finished the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and
got the waggon ready it was dark in the yard when the guests came out they
threw their packs on board and climbed in the farmer sat in the driving seat
and whipped up his two stout ponies his wife stood in the light of the open
door
 you be careful of yourself maggot  she called  don t go arguing
with any foreigners and come straight back 
 i will  said he and drove out of the gate there was now no breath of
wind stirring the night was still and quiet and a chill was in the air they
went without lights and took it slowly after a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossing a deep dike and climbing a short slope up on to the high banked
causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either way north and south but nothing
could be seen in the darkness and there was not a sound in the still air thin
strands of river mist were hanging above the dikes and crawling over the
fields
 it s going to be thick  said maggot  but i ll not light my
lantern till i turn for home we ll hear anything on the road long before we
meet it tonight 
it was five miles or more from maggot s lane to the ferry the hobbits
wrapped themselves up but their ears were strained for any sound above the
creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies  hoofs the waggon
seemed slower than a snail to frodo beside him pippin was nodding towards
sleep but sam was staring forwards into the rising fog
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last it was marked by two
tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right farmer maggot drew in
his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt they were just beginning lo
scramble out when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on
the road ahead the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies  heads and peering forward
into the gloom clip clop clip clop came the approaching rider the fall
of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
 you d better be hidden mr frodo  said sam anxiously  you get
down in the waggon and cover up with blankets and we ll send this rider to
the rightabouts  he climbed out and went to the farmer s side black riders
would have to ride over him to get near the waggon
clop clop clop clop
 hallo there  called farmer maggot the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist a yard or
two ahead  now then  said the farmer throwing the reins to sam and
striding forward  don t you come a step nearer what do you want and where
are you going 
 i want mr baggins have you seen him  said a muffled voice   but the
voice was the voice of merry brandybuck a dark lantern was uncovered and its
light fell on the astonished face of the farmer
 mr merry  he cried
 yes of course who did you think it was  said merry coming forward as
he came out of the mist and their fears subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish
to ordinary hobbit size he was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed round his
neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him  so there you are at last 
said merry  i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today and
i was just going back to supper when it grew foggy i came across and rode up
towards stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches but i m blest if i know
which way you have come where did you find them mr maggot in your
duck pond 
 no i caught  em trespassing  said the farmer  and nearly set my
dogs on  em but they ll tell you all the story i ve no doubt now if
you ll excuse me mr merry and mr frodo and all i d best be turning for
home mrs maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick 
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it  well good night to you
all  he said  it s been a queer day and no mistake but all s well as
ends well though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors
i ll not deny that i ll be glad now when i do  he lit his lanterns and
got up suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat  i was nearly
forgetting  he said  mrs maggot put this up for mr baggins with her
compliments  he handed it down and moved off followed by a chorus of thanks
and good nights
they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into
the foggy night suddenly frodo laughed from the covered basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was rising
 
 now we had better get home ourselves  said merry there s something
funny about all this i see but it must wait till we get in 
they turned down the ferry lane which was straight and well kept and edged
with large white washed stones in a hundred yards or so it brought them to the
river bank where there was a broad wooden landing stage a large flat
ferry boat was moored beside it the white bollards near the water s edge
glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts behind them the mists in the
flat fields were now above the hedges but the water before them was dark with
only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank there seemed to
be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry and the others followed
merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole the brandywine flowed slow and
broad before them on the other side the bank was steep and up it a winding
path climbed from the further landing lamps were twinkling there behind loomed
up the buck hill and out of it through stray shrouds of mist shone many round
windows yellow and red they were the windows of brandy hall the ancient home
of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck family one of the oldest in
the marish or indeed in the shire had crossed the river which was the original
boundary of the land eastwards he built and excavated brandy hall changed
his name to brandybuck and settled down to become master of what was virtually
a small independent country his family grew and grew and after his days
continued to grow until brandy hall occupied the whole of the low hill and had
three large front doors many side doors and about a hundred windows the
brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow and later to
build all round about that was the origin of buckland a thickly inhabited
strip between the river and the old forest a sort of colony from the shire its
chief village was bucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy
hall
the people in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders and the
authority of the master of the hall as the head of the brandybuck family was
called was still acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey but most
of the folk of the old shire regarded the bucklanders as peculiar half
foreigners as it were though as a matter of fact they were not very different
from the other hobbits of the four farthings except in one point they were
fond of boats and some of them could swim
their land was originally unprotected from the east but on that side they
had built a hedge the high hay it had been planted many generations ago and
was now thick and tail for it was constantly tended it ran all the way from
brandywine bridge in a big loop curving away from the river to haysend where
the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine well over twenty
miles from end to end but of course it was not a complete protection the
forest drew close to the hedge in many places the bucklanders kept their doors
locked after dark and that also was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before he
had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by his old life lay
behind in the mists dark adventure lay in front he scratched his head and for
a moment had a passing wish that mr frodo could have gone on living quietly at
bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry merry was tying it up and pippin was
already leading the pony up the path when sam who had been looking back as if
to take farewell of the shire said in a hoarse whisper
 look back mr frodo do you see anything 
on the far stage under the distant lamps they could just make out a figure
it looked like a dark black bundle left behind but as they looked it seemed to
move and sway this way and that as if searching the ground it then crawled or
went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps
 what in the shire is that  exclaimed merry
 something that is following us  said frodo  but don t ask any more
now let s get away at once  they hurried up the path to the top of the
bank but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist and nothing
could be seen
 thank goodness you don t keep any boats on the west bank  said frodo
 can horses cross the river 
 they can go twenty miles north to brandywine bridge   or they might
swim  answered merry  though i never heard of any horse swimming the
brandywine but what have horses to do with it  i ll tell you later
let s get indoors and then we can talk 
 all right you and pippin know your way so i ll just ride on and tell
fatty bolger that you are coming we ll see about supper and things 
 we had our supper early with farmer maggot  said frodo  but we could
do with another 
 you shall have it give me that basket  said merry and rode ahead into
the darkness
it was some distance from the brandywine to frodo s new house at
crickhollow they passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left and on the
outskirts of bucklebury struck the main road of buckland that ran south from the
bridge half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their
right this they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into
the country
at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge nothing could be seen of
the house in the dark it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide
circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge frodo
had chosen it because it stood in an out of the way corner of the country and
there were no other dwellings close by you could get in and out without being
noticed it had been built a long while before by the brandybucks for the use
of guests or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life
of brandy hall for a time it was an old fashioned countrified house as much
like a hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no upper storey and
it had a roof of turf round windows and a large round door
as they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible the
windows were dark and shuttered frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger
opened it a friendly light streamed out they slipped in quickly and shut
themselves and the light inside they were in a wide hall with doors on either
side in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house
 well what do you think of it  asked merry coming up the passage  we
have done our best in a short time to make it look like home after all fatty
and i only got here with the last cart load yesterday 
frodo looked round it did look like home many of his own favourite things  
or bilbo s things they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling  
were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end it was a
pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found himself wishing that he was
really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement it seemed unfair to have
put his friends to all this trouble and he wondered again how he was going to
break the news to them that he must leave them so soon indeed at once yet that
would have to be done that very night before they all went to bed
 it s delightful  he said with an effort  i hardly feel that i have
moved at all 
the travellers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor
merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end firelight
came out and a puff of steam
 a bath  cried pippin  o blessed meriadoc 
 which order shall we go in  said frodo  eldest first or quickest
first you ll be last either way master peregrin 
 trust me to arrange things better than that  said merry  we can t
begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths in that room there are three
tubs and a copper full of boiling water there are also towels mats and soap
get inside and be quick 
merry and fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage and
busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper snatches of
competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and
wallowing the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of
bilbo s favourite bath songs
sing hey for the bath at close of day

that washes the weary mud away

a loon is he that will not sing

o water hot is a noble thing



o sweet is the sound of falling rain

and the brook that leaps from hill to plain

but better than rain or rippling streams

is water hot that smokes and steams



o water cold we may pour at need

down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed

but better is beer if drink we lack

and water hot poured down the back



o water is fair that leaps on high

in a fountain white beneath the sky

but never did fountain sound so sweet

as splashing hot water with my feet
there was a terrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo it
appeared that a lot of pippin s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on
high
merry went to the door  what about supper and beer in the throat  he
called frodo came out drying his hair
 there s so much water in the air that i m coming into the kitchen to
finish  he said
 lawks  said merry looking in the stone floor was swimming  you
ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat peregrin  he said
 hurry up or we shan t wait for you 
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire  i suppose you
three won t want mushrooms again  said fredegar without much hope
 yes we shall  cried pippin
 they re mine  said frodo  given to me by mrs maggot a
queen among farmers  wives take your greedy hands away and i ll serve
them 
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the greediest likings
of big people a fact which partly explains young frodo s long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot on this
occasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit standards there
were also many other things to follow and when they had finished even fatty
bolger heaved a sigh of content they pushed back the table and drew chairs
round the fire
 we ll clear up later  said merry  now tell me all about it i
guess that you have been having adventures which was not quite fair without me
i want a full account and most of all i want to know what was the matter with
old maggot and why he spoke to me like that he sounded almost as if he was scared
if that is possible 
 we have all been scared  said pippin after a pause in which frodo
stared at the fire and did not speak  you would have been too if you had
been chased for two days by black riders 
 and what are they 
 black figures riding on black horses  answered pippin  if frodo
won t talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning  he then gave
a full account of their journey from the time when they left hobbiton sam gave
various supporting nods and exclamations frodo remained silent
 i should think you were making it all up  said merry  if i had not
seen that black shape on the landing stage   and heard the queer sound in
maggot s voice what do you make of it all frodo 
 cousin frodo has been very close  said pippin  but the time has come
for him to open out so far we have been given nothing more to go on than farmer
maggot s guess that it has something to do with old bilbo s treasure 
 that was only a guess  said frodo hastily  maggot does not know anything 
 old maggot is a shrewd fellow  said merry  a lot goes on behind his
round face that does not come out in his talk i ve heard that he used to go
into the old forest at one time and he has the reputation of knowing a good
many strange things but you can at least tell us frodo whether you think his
guess good or bad 
 i think  answered frodo slowly  that it was a good guess as
far as it goes there is a connexion with bilbo s old adventures and
the riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching for him or
for me i also fear if you want to know that it is no joke at all and that i
am not safe here or anywhere else  he looked round at the windows and walls
as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way the others looked at him in
silence and exchanged meaning glances among themselves
 it s coming out in a minute  whispered pippin to merry merry nodded
 well  said frodo at last sitting up and straightening his back as if
he had made a decision  i can t keep it dark any longer i have got
something to tell you all but i don t know quite how to begin 
 i think i could help you  said merry quietly  by telling you some of
it myself 
 what do you mean  said frodo looking at him anxiously  just this
my dear old frodo you are miserable because you don t know how to say
good bye you meant to leave the shire of course but danger has come on you
sooner than you expected and now you are making up your mind to go at once and
you don t want to we are very sorry for you 
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again his look of surprise was so comical
that they laughed  dear old frodo  said pippin  did you really think
you had thrown dust in all our eyes you have not been nearly careful or clever
enough for that you have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to
all your haunts all this year since april we have constantly heard you
muttering “shall i ever look down into that valley again i wonder” and
things like that and pretending that you had come to the end of your money and
actually selling your beloved bag end to those sackville bagginses and all
those close talks with gandalf 
 good heavens  said frodo  i thought i had been both careful and
clever i don t know what gandalf would say is all the shire discussing my
departure then 
 oh no  said merry  don t worry about that the secret won t keep
for long of course but at present it is i think only known to us
conspirators after all you must remember that we know you well and are often
with you we can usually guess what you are thinking i knew bilbo too to tell
you the truth i had been watching you rather closely ever since he left i
thought you would go after him sooner or later indeed i expected you to go
sooner and lately we have been very anxious we have been terrified that you
might give us the slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did ever
since this spring we have kept our eyes open and done a good deal of planning
on our own account you are not going to escape so easily 
 but i must go  said frodo  it cannot be helped dear friends it is
wretched for us all but it is no use your trying to keep me since you have
guessed so much please help me and do not hinder me 
 you do not understand  said pippin  you must go   and therefore we
must too merry and i are coming with you sam is an excellent fellow and
would jump down a dragon s throat to save you if he did not trip over his own
feet but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure 
 my dear and most beloved hobbits  said frodo deeply moved  but i
could not allow it i decided that long ago too you speak of danger but you
do not understand this is no treasure hunt no there and back journey i am
flying from deadly peril into deadly peril 
 of course we understand  said merry firmly  that is why we have
decided to come we know the ring is no laughing matter but we are going to do
our best to help you against the enemy 
 the ring  said frodo now completely amazed
 yes the ring  said merry  my dear old hobbit you don t allow for
the inquisitiveness of friends i have known about the existence of the ring for
years   before bilbo went away in fact but since he obviously regarded it as
secret i kept the knowledge in my head until we formed our conspiracy i did
not know bilbo of course as well as i know you i was too young and he was
also more careful   but he was not careful enough if you want to know how i
first found out i will tell you 
 go on  said frodo faintly
it was the sackville bagginses that were his downfall as you might expect
one day a year before the party i happened to be walking along the road when
i saw bilbo ahead suddenly in the distance the s bs appeared coming towards
us bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanished i was so startled that
i hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i got
through the hedge and walked along the field inside i was peeping through into
the road after the s bs had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he
suddenly reappeared i caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his
trouser pocket
 after that i kept my eyes open in fact i confess that i spied but you
must admit that it was very intriguing and i was only in my teens i must be
the only one in the shire besides you frodo that has ever seen the old
fellow s secret book 
 you have read his book  cried frodo  good heavens above is nothing
safe 
 not too safe i should say  said merry  but i have only had one
rapid glance and that was difficult to get he never left the book about i
wonder what became of it i should like another look have you got it frodo 
 no it was not at bag end he must have taken it away 
 well as i was saying  merry proceeded  i kept my knowledge to
myself till this spring when things got serious then we formed our conspiracy
and as we were serious too and meant business we have not been too
scrupulous you are not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse but if
you want to be introduced to our chief investigator i can produce him 
 where is he  said frodo looking round as if he expected a masked and
sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
 step forward sam  said merry and sam stood up with a face scarlet up
to the ears  here s our collector of information and he collected a lot i
can tell you before he was finally caught after which i may say he seemed to
regard himself as on parole and dried up 
 sam  cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no further and quite
unable to decide whether he felt angry amused relieved or merely foolish
 yes sir  said sam  begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong
to you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter he has some sense
mind you and when you said go alone he said no take someone as you
can trust 
 but it does not seem that i can trust anyone  said frodo sam looked at
him unhappily  it all depends on what you want  put in merry  you can
trust us to stick to you through thick and thin   to the bitter end and you can
trust us to keep any secret of yours   closer than you keep it yourself but you
cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone and go off without a word we are
your friends frodo anyway there it is we know most of what gandalf has told
you we know a good deal about the ring we are horribly afraid   but we are
coming with you or following you like hounds 
 and after all sir  added sam  you did ought to take the elves 
advice gildor said you should take them as was willing and you can t deny
it 
 i don t deny it  said frodo looking at sam who was now grinning
 i don t deny it but i ll never believe you are sleeping again whether
you snore or not i shall kick you hard to make sure
 you are a set of deceitful scoundrels  he said turning to the others
 but bless you  he laughed getting up and waving his arms  i give in i
will take gildor s advice if the danger were not so dark i should dance for
joy even so i cannot help feeling happy happier than i have felt for a long
time i had dreaded this evening 
 good that s settled three cheers for captain frodo and company 
they shouted and they danced round him merry and pippin began a song which
they had apparently got ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwarf song that started bilbo on his
adventure long ago and went to the same tune
farewell we call to hearth and hall

though wind may blow and rain may fall

we must away ere break of day

far over wood and mountain tall



to rivendell where elves yet dwell

in glades beneath the misty fell

through moor and waste we ride in haste

and whither then we cannot tell



with foes ahead behind us dread

beneath the sky shall be our bed

until at last our toil be passed

our journey done our errand sped



we must away we must away

we ride before the break of day
 very good  said frodo  but in that case there are a lot of things to
do before we go to bed   under a roof for tonight at any rate 
 oh that was poetry  said pippin  do you really mean to start before
the break of day 
 i don t know  answered frodo  i fear those black riders and i am
sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long especially in a place to which it
is known i was going also gildor advised me not to wait but i should very much
like to see gandalf i could see that even gildor was disturbed when he heard
that gandalf had never appeared it really depends on two things how soon could
the riders get to bucklebury and how soon could we get off it will take a good
deal of preparation 
 the answer to the second question  said merry  is that we could get
off in an hour i have prepared practically everything there are six ponies in
a stable across the fields stores and tackle are all packed except for a few
extra clothes and the perishable food 
 it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy  said frodo  but
what about the black riders would it be safe to wait one day for gandalf 
 that all depends on what you think the riders would do if they found you
here  answered merry  they could have reached here by now of
course if they were not stopped at the north gate where the hedge runs down to
the river bank just this side of the bridge the gate guards would not let them
through by night though they might break through even in the daylight they
would try to keep them out i think at any rate until they got a message
through to the master of the hall   for they would not like the look of the
riders and would certainly be frightened by them but of course buckland
cannot resist a determined attack for long and it is possible that in the
morning even a black rider that rode up and asked for mr baggins would be let
through it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at
crickhollow 
frodo sat for a while in thought  i have made up my mind  he said
finally  i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light but i am not going
by road it would be safer to wait here than that if i go through the
north gate my departure from buckland will be known at once instead of being
secret for several days at least as it might be and what is more the bridge
and the east road near the borders will certainly be watched whether any rider
gets into buckland or not we don t know how many there are but there are at
least two and possibly more the only thing to do is to go off in a quite
unexpected direction 
 but that can only mean going into the old forest  said fredegar
horrified  you can t be thinking of doing that it is quite as dangerous as
black riders 
 not quite  said merry it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is
right it is the only way of getting off without being followed at once with
luck we might gel a considerable start 
 but you won t have any luck in the old forest  objected fredegar
 no one ever has luck in there you ll gel lost people don t go in
there 
 oh yes they do  said merry  the brandybucks go in   occasionally
when the fit takes them we have a private entrance frodo went in once long
ago i have been in several times usually in daylight of course when the
trees are sleepy and fairly quiet 
 well do as you think best  said fredegar  i am more afraid of the
old forest than of anything i know about the stories about it are a nightmare
but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey still i am very
glad someone is stopping behind who can tell gandalf what you have done when
he turns up as i am sure he will before long 
fond as he was of frodo fatty bolger had no desire to leave the shire nor
to see what lay outside it his family came from the eastfarthing from
budgeford in bridgefields in fact but he had never been over the brandywine
bridge his task according to the original plans of the conspirators was to
stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and to keep up as long as possible
the pretence that mr baggins was still living at crickhollow he had even
brought along some old clothes of frodo s to help him in playing the part
they little thought how dangerous that part might prove
 excellent  said frodo when he understood the plan  we could not
have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise i don t know whether these
riders can read or not of course but i should not have dared to risk a written
message in case they got in and searched the house but if fatty is willing to
hold the fort and i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we have gone that
decides me i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow 
 well that s that  said pippin  on the whole i would rather have
our job than fatty s   waiting here till black riders come 
 you wait till you are well inside the forest  said fredegar
 you ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow 
 it s no good arguing about it any more  said merry  we have still
got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing before we get to
bed i shall call you all before the break of day 
when at last he had got to bed frodo could not sleep for some time his legs
ached he was glad that he was riding in the morning eventually he fell into a
vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark
sea of tangled trees down below among the roots there was the sound of
creatures crawling and snuffling he felt sure they would smell him out sooner
or later
then he heard a noise in the distance at first he thought it was a great
wind coming over the leaves of the forest then he knew that it was not leaves
but the sound of the sea far off a sound he had never heard in waking life
though it had often troubled his dreams suddenly he found he was out in the
open there were no trees after all he was on a dark heath and there was a
strange salt smell in the air looking up he saw before him a tall white tower
standing alone on a high ridge a great desire came over him to climb the tower
and see the sea he started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower but
suddenly a light came in the sky and there was a noise of thunder
 
frodo woke suddenly it was still dark in the room merry was standing there
with a candle in one hand and banging on the door with the other  all right
what is it  said frodo still shaken and bewildered
 what is it  cried merry  it is time to get up it is half past four
and very foggy come on sam is already getting breakfast ready even pippin is
up i am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch the one that is to be the
baggage carrier wake that sluggard fatty at least he must get up and see us
off 
soon after six o clock the five hobbits were ready to start fatty bolger
was still yawning they stole quietly out of the house merry went in front
leading a laden pony and took his way along a path that went through a spinney
behind the house and then cut across several fields the leaves of trees were
glistening and every twig was dripping the grass was grey with cold dew
everything was still and far away noises seemed near and clear fowls
chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house
in their shed they found the ponies sturdy little beasts of the kind loved
by hobbits not speedy but good for a long day s work they mounted and soon
they were riding off into the mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them
and close forbiddingly behind them after riding for about an hour slowly and
without talking they saw the hedge looming suddenly ahead it was tall and
netted over with silver cobwebs  how are you going to get through this 
asked fredegar  follow me  said merry  and you will see  he turned
to the left along the hedge and soon they came to a point where it bent
inwards running along the lip of a hollow a cutting had been made at some
distance from the hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground it had
walls of brick at the sides which rose steadily until suddenly they arched
over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the hedge and came out in the
hollow on the other side
here fatty bolger halted  good bye frodo  he said  i wish you were
not going into the forest i only hope you will not need rescuing before the day
is out but good luck to you   today and every day 
 if there are no worse things ahead than the old forest i shall be
lucky  said frodo  tell gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall
soon be back on it and going as fast as we can   good bye  they cried
and rode down the slope and disappeared from fredegar s sight into the tunnel
it was dark and damp at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick set
iron bars merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they had all passed
through he pushed it to again it shut with a clang and the lock clicked the
sound was ominous
 there  said merry  you have left the shire and are now outside and
on the edge of the old forest 
 are the stories about it true  asked pippin
 i don t know what stories you mean  merry answered  if you mean
the old bogey stories fatty s nurses used to tell him about goblins and
wolves and things of that sort i should say no at any rate i don t believe
them but the forest is queer everything in it is very much more alive
more aware of what is going on so to speak than things are in the shire and
the trees do not like strangers they watch you they are usually content merely
to watch you as long as daylight lasts and don t do much occasionally the
most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or stick a root out or grasp at you
with a long trailer but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only once or twice been in here after dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispering to each other passing news and plots
along in an unintelligible language and the branches swayed and groped without
any wind they do say the trees do actually move and can surround strangers and
hem them in in fact long ago they attacked the hedge they came and planted
themselves right by it and leaned over it but the hobbits came and cut down
hundreds of trees and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned all the
ground in a long strip east of the hedge after that the trees gave up the
attack but they became very unfriendly there is still a wide bare space not
far inside where the bonfire was made 
 is it only the trees that are dangerous  asked pippin
 there are various queer things living deep in the forest and on the far
side  said merry  or at least i have heard so but i have never seen any
of them but something makes paths whenever one comes inside one finds open
tracks but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or was for a long time the beginning of
quite a broad path leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or less in our
direction east and a little north that is the path i am going to try and
find 
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow on the
far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the forest a hundred
yards and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon as it brought them
under the trees looking back they could see the dark line of the hedge through
the stems of trees that were already thick about them looking ahead they could
see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes straight or bent twisted
leaning squat or slender smooth or gnarled and branched and all the stems
were green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful  you had better lead on and find that
path  frodo said to him  don t let us lose one another or forget which
way the hedge lies 
they picked a way among the trees and their ponies plodded along carefully
avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots there was no undergrowth the
ground was rising steadily and as they went forward it seemed that the trees
became taller darker and thicker there was no sound except an occasional
drip of moisture falling through the still leaves for the moment there was no
whispering or movement among the branches but they all got an uncomfortable
feeling that they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and
even enmity the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up
quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden
blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path and the trees seemed constantly to
bar their way pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer and
without warning let out a shout  oi oi  he cried  i am not going to do
anything just let me pass through will you 
the others halted startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy
curtain there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more
crowded and more watchful than before
 i should not shout if i were you  said merry it does more harm than
good 
frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through and if he
had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood merry was
looking from side to side and seemed already uncertain which way to go pippin
noticed it  it has not taken you long to lose us  he said but at that
moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
 well well  he said  these trees do shift there is the
bonfire glade in front of us or i hope so but the path to it seems to have
moved away 
the light grew clearer as they went forward suddenly they came out of the
trees and found themselves in a wide circular space there was sky above them
blue and clear to their surprise for down under the forest roof they had not
been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist the sun was
not however high enough yet to shine down into the clearing though its light
was on the tree tops the leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of
the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall no tree grew there only
rough grass and many tall plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley
fire weed seeding into fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles a dreary
place but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the broadening
daylight in the sky at the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall
of trees and a clear path beyond it they could see it running on into the
wood wide in places and open above though every now and again the trees drew
in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs up this path they rode they were
still climbing gently but they now went much quicker and with better heart
for it seemed to them that the forest had relented and was going to let them
pass unhindered after all
but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy the trees drew close
again on either side and they could no longer see far ahead now stronger than
ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them so silent was it
that the fall of their ponies  hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally
stumbling on hidden roots seemed to thud in their ears frodo tried to sing a
song to encourage them but his voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land

despair not for though dark they stand

all woods there be must end at last

and see the open sun go past

the setting sun the rising sun

the day s end or the day begun

for east or west all woods must fail…
fail   even as he said the word his voice faded into silence the air
seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome just behind them a large
branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path the trees
seemed to close in before them
 they do not like all that about ending and failing  said merry  i
should not sing any more at present wait till we do get to the edge and then
we ll turn and give them a rousing chorus 
he spoke cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the others did not answer they were depressed a heavy weight was settling
steadily on frodo s heart and he regretted now with every step forward that
he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees he was indeed just
about to stop and propose going back if that was still possible when things
took a new turn the path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see the path going almost
straight forward before them but some distance off there stood a green
hill top treeless rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood the path
seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of climbing out
for a while above the roof of the forest the path dipped and then again began
to climb upwards leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside there
it left the trees and faded into the turf the wood stood all round the hill
like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round until they reached
the top there they stood and gazed about them the air was gleaming and sunlit
but hazy and they could not see to any great distance near at hand the mist
was now almost gone though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood and to
the south of them out of a deep fold cutting right across the forest the fog
still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke
 that  said merry pointing with his hand  that is the line of the
withywindle it comes down out of the downs and flows south west through the
midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysend we don t want to go that
way the withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood  
the centre from which all the queerness comes as it were 
the others looked in the direction that merry pointed out but they could see
little but mists over the damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern
half of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hill top was now getting hot it must have been about eleven
o clock but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other
directions in the west they could not make out either the line of the hedge or
the valley of the brandywine beyond it northward where they looked most
hopefully they could see nothing that might be the line of the great east road
for which they were making they were on an island in a sea of trees and the
horizon was veiled
on the south eastern side the ground fell very steeply as if the slopes of
the hill were continued far down under the trees like island shores that really
are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters they sat on the green
edge and looked out over the woods below them while they ate their mid day
meal as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the
grey green lines of the downs that lay beyond the old forest on that side that
cheered them greatly for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the
wood s borders though they did not mean to go that way if they could help
it the barrow downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit legend as the forest
itself
at length they made up their minds to go on again the path that had brought
them to the hill reappeared on the northward side but they had not followed it
far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right soon it
began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading
towards the withywindle valley not at all the direction they wished lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike
northward for although they had not been able to see it from the hill top the
road must lie that way and it could not be many miles off also northward and
to the left of the path the land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up
to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines and firs replaced the oaks and
ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood
at first their choice seemed to be good they got along at a fair speed
though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to have veered eastwards but after a time the trees began to
close in again just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and
less tangled then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and
choked with brambles these lay usually right across their line of march and
could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again which was troublesome
and difficult with their ponies each time they climbed down they found the
hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave way when they turned to the right and they had
to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further
bank each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeper and darker and
always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way and they
were forced to the right and downwards
after an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction though they
knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all they were
being headed off and were simply following a course chosen for them   eastwards
and southwards into the heart of the forest and not out of it
the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold
that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met it was so sleep and
overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again either forwards or
backwards without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind all they could
do was to follow the fold   downwards the ground grew soft and in places
boggy springs appeared in the banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed then the ground began to
fall rapidly and the brook growing strong and noisy flowed and leaped swiftly
downhill they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees high above
them
after stumbling along for some way along the stream they came quite suddenly
out of the gloom as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them coming
to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a
high sleep bank almost a cliff at its feet was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep a
golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land
between in the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water
bordered with ancient willows arched over with willows blocked with fallen
willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves the air was thick
with them fluttering yellow from the branches for there was a warm and gentle
breeze blowing softly in the valley and the reeds were rustling and the
willow boughs were creaking
 well now i have at least some notion of where we are  said merry
 we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended this is
the river withywindle i will go on and explore 
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses after
a while he reappeared and reported that there was fairly solid ground between
the cliff foot and the river in some places firm turf went down to the
water s edge  what s more  he said  there seems to be something
like a footpath winding along on this side of the river if we turn left and
follow it we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the forest
eventually 
 i dare say  said pippin  that is if the track goes on so far and
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there who made the track do
you suppose and why i am sure it was not for our benefit i am getting very
suspicious of this forest and everything in it and i begin to believe all the
stories about it and have you any idea how far eastward we should have to
go 
 no  said merry  i haven t i don t know in the least how far
down the withywindle we are or who could possibly come here often enough to
make a path along it but there is no other way out that i can see or think
of 
there being nothing else for it they filed out and merry led them to the
path that he had discovered everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and
tall in places far above their heads but once found the path was easy to
follow as it turned and twisted picking out the sounder ground among the bogs
and pools here and there it passed over other rills running down gullies into
the withywindle out of the higher forest lands and at these points there were
tree trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across
the hobbits began to feel very hot there were armies of flies of all kinds
buzzing round their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs at
last they came suddenly into a thin shade great grey branches reached across
the path each step forward became more reluctant than the last sleepiness
seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs and falling softly
out of the air upon their heads and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod just in front of him pippin
fell forward on to his knees frodo halted  it s no good  he heard merry
saying  can t go another step without rest must have nap it s cool
under the willows less flies 
frodo did not like the sound of this  come on  he cried  we can t
have a nap yet we must get clear of the forest first  but the others were
too far gone to care beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly
suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him his head swam there now
seemed hardly a sound in the air the flies had stopped buzzing only a gentle
noise on the edge of hearing a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered
seemed to stir in the boughs above he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning
over him a huge willow tree old and hoary enormous it looked its sprawling
branches going up like reaching arms with many long fingered hands its knotted
and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs
moved the leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and he toppled
over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to
the willow trunk behind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the
tree swayed and creaked they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
softly against the light and singing they shut their eyes and then it seemed
that they could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and
sleep they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of
the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him then
with an effort he struggled to his feel again he felt a compelling desire for
cool water  wait for me sam  he stammered  must bathe feet a
minute 
half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree where
great winding roots grew out into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining
down to drink he straddled one of these and paddled his hot feel in the cool
brown water and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the
tree
sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern he was
worried the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness
uncanny  there s more behind this than sun and warm air  he muttered to
himself  i don t like this great big tree i don t trust it hark at it
singing about sleep now this won t do at all 
he pulled himself to his feet and staggered off to see what had become of
the ponies he found that two had wandered on a good way along the path and he
had just caught them and brought them back towards the others when he heard two
noises one loud and the other soft but very clear one was the splash of
something heavy falling into the water the other was a noise like the snick of
a lock when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank frodo was in the water close to the edge and a
great tree root seemed to be over him and holding him down but he was not
struggling sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from under the root
and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank almost at once he woke and
coughed and spluttered
 do you know sam  he said at length  the beastly tree threw
me in i felt it the big root just twisted round and tipped me in 
 you were dreaming i expect mr frodo  said sam  you shouldn t sit
in such a place if you feel sleepy 
 what about the others  frodo asked  i wonder what sort of dreams
they are having 
they went round to the other side of the tree and then sam understood the
click that he had heard pippin had vanished the crack by which he had laid
himself had closed together so that not a chink could be seen merry was
trapped another crack had closed about his waist his legs lay outside but the
rest of him was inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of
pincers
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain they then
struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor merry
it was quite useless
 what a foul thing to happen  cried frodo wildly  why did we ever
come into this dreadful forest i wish we were all back at crickhollow  he
kicked the tree with all his strength heedless of his own feet a hardly
perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches the leaves
rustled and whispered but with a sound now of faint and far off laughter
 i suppose we haven t got an axe among our luggage mr frodo  asked
sam
 i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood  said frodo  that
wouldn t be much use 
 wait a minute  cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood
 we might do something with fire 
 we might  said frodo doubtfully  we might succeed in roasting pippin
alive inside 
 we might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with  said sam
fiercely  if it don t let them go i ll have it down if i have to gnaw
it  he ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder boxes and
a hatchet
quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of bark and made a pile
of broken twigs and chopped sticks these they heaped against the trunk on the
far side of the tree from the prisoners as soon as sam had struck a spark into
the tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up
the twigs crackled little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of
the ancient tree and scorched it a tremor ran through the whole willow the
leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger a loud
scream came from merry and from far inside the tree they heard pippin give a
muffled yell
 put it out put it out  cried merry  he ll squeeze me in two if
you don t he says so 
 who what  shouted frodo rushing round to the other side of the tree
 put it out put it out  begged merry the branches of the willow began
to sway violently there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards
to the branches of all the other trees round about as though they had dropped a
stone into the quiet slumber of the river valley and set up ripples of anger
that ran out over the whole forest sam kicked at the little fire and stamped
out the sparks but frodo without any clear idea of why he did so or what he
hoped for ran along the path crying help help help it seemed to him
that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it was blown away
from him by the willow wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves as soon as the
words left his mouth he felt desperate lost and witless
suddenly he slopped there was an answer or so he thought but it seemed to
come from behind him away down the path further back in the forest he turned
round and listened and soon there could be no doubt someone was singing a
song a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily but it was singing
nonsense
hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo

ring a dong hop along fal lal the willow

tom bom jolly tom tom bombadillo
half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger frodo and sam now both stood
still suddenly out of a long string of nonsense words or so they seemed the
voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song
hey come merry dot derry dol my darling

light goes the weather wind and the feathered starling

down along under hill shining in the sunlight

waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight

there my pretty lady is river woman s daughter

slender as the willow wand clearer than the water

old tom bombadil water lilies bringing

comes hopping home again can you hear him singing

hey come merry dol deny dol and merry o

goldberry goldberry merry yellow berry o

poor old willow man you tuck your roots away

tom s in a hurry now evening will follow day

tom s going home again water lilies bringing

hey come derry dol can you hear me singing
frodo and sam stood as if enchanted the wind puffed out the leaves hung
silently again on stiff branches there was another burst of song and then
suddenly hopping and dancing along the path there appeared above the reeds an
old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound there came into view a man or so it seemed at any
rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one
of the big people though he made noise enough for one slumping along with
great yellow boots on his thick legs and charging through grass and rushes like
a cow going down to drink he had a blue coat and a long brown beard his eyes
were blue and bright and his face was red as a ripe apple but creased into a
hundred wrinkles of laughter in his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a
tray a small pile of white water lilies
 help  cried frodo and sam running towards him with their hands
stretched out
 whoa whoa steady there  cried the old man holding up one hand and
they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff  now my little fellows
where be you a going to puffing like a bellows what s the matter here then
do you know who i am i m tom bombadil tell me what s your trouble tom s
in a hurry now don t you crush my lilies 
 my friends are caught in the willow tree  cried frodo breathlessly
 master merry s being squeezed in a crack  cried sam
 what  shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air  old man willow
naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended i know the tune for him
old grey willow man i ll freeze his marrow cold if he don t behave
himself i ll sing his roots off i ll sing a wind up and blow leaf and
branch away old man willow  setting down his lilies carefully on the grass
he ran to the tree there he saw merry s feet still sticking out   the rest
had already been drawn further inside tom put his mouth to the crack and began
singing into it in a low voice they could not catch the words but evidently
merry was aroused his legs began to kick tom sprang away and breaking off a
hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it  you let them out again
old man willow  he said  what be you a thinking of you should not be
waking eat earth dig deep drink water go to sleep bombadil is talking 
he then seized merry s feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split open and out of it
pippin sprang as if he had been kicked then with a loud snap both cracks
closed fast again a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete
silence fell
 thank you  said the hobbits one after the other
tom bombadil burst out laughing  well my little fellows  said he
stooping so that he peered into their faces  you shall come home with me the
table is all laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
goldberry is waiting time enough for questions around the supper table you
follow after me as quick as you are able  with that he picked up his lilies
and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the
path eastward still singing loudly and nonsensically
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed after him as
fast as they could but that was not fast enough tom soon disappeared in front
of them and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away suddenly his
voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo
hop along my little friends up the withywindle

tom s going on ahead candles for to kindle

down west sinks the sun soon you will be groping

when the night shadows fall then the door will open

out of the window panes light will twinkle yellow

fear no alder black heed no hoary willow

fear neither root nor bough tom goes on before you

hey now merry dot we ll be waiting for you
after that the hobbits heard no more almost at once the sun seemed to sink
into the trees behind them they thought of the slanting light of evening
glittering on the brandywine river and the windows of bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds of lights great shadows fell across them trunks and
branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path white mists began to
rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees
upon its borders out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and
mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow the path and they were very tired their legs
seemed leaden strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either
side of them and if they looked up to the pale sky they caught sight of queer
gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered
down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood they began to feel
that all this country was unreal and that they were stumbling through an
ominous dream that led to no awakening
just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill they noticed that
the ground was gently rising the water began to murmur in the darkness they
caught the white glimmer of foam where the river flowed over a short fall then
suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind they stepped
out from the forest and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them the
river now small and swift was leaping merrily down to meet them glinting here
and there in the light of the stars which were already shining in the sky
the grass under their feet was smooth and short as if it had been mown or
shaven the eaves of the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge the
path was now plain before them well tended and bordered with stone it wound up
on to the top of a grassy knoll now grey under the pale starry night and
there still high above them on a further slope they saw the twinkling lights
of a house down again the path went and then up again up a long smooth
hillside of turf towards the light suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out
brightly from a door that was opened there was tom bombadil s house before
them up down under hill behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and
bare and beyond that the dark shapes of the barrow downs stalked away into the
eastern night
they all hurried forward hobbits and ponies already half their weariness
and all their fears had fallen from them hey come merry dol rolled out
the song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop along my hearties

hobbits ponies all we are fond of parties

now let the fun begin let us sing together
then another clear voice as young and as ancient as spring like the song of
a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills
came falling like silver to meet them
now let the song begin let us sing together

of sun stars moon and mist rain and cloudy weather

light on the budding leaf dew on the feather

wind on the open hill bells on the heather

reeds by the shady pool lilies on the water

old tom bombadil and the river daughter
and with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a golden light
was all about them
 
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still
blinking they were in a long low room filled with the light of lamps swinging
from the beams of the roof and on the table of dark polished wood stood many
candles tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room facing the outer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders her gown was green green as
young reeds shot with silver like beads of dew and her belt was of gold
shaped like a chain of flag lilies set with the pale blue eyes of
forget me nots about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware
white water lilies were floating so that she seemed to be enthroned in the
midst of a pool
 enter good guests  she said and as she spoke they knew that it was
her clear voice they had heard singing they came a few timid steps further into
the room and began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward like
folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water have been
answered by a fair young elf queen clad in living flowers but before they could
say anything she sprang lightly up and over the lily bowls and ran laughing
towards them and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the
flowering borders of a river
 come dear folk  she said taking frodo by the hand  laugh and be
merry i am goldberry daughter of the river  then lightly she passed them
and closing the door she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out
across it  let us shut out the night  she said  for you are still
afraid perhaps of mist and tree shadows and deep water and untame things
fear nothing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil 
the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she looked at each of them and
smiled  fair lady goldberry  said frodo at last feeling his heart moved
with a joy that he did not understand he stood as he had at times stood
enchanted by fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon him was
different less keen and lofty was the delight but deeper and nearer to mortal
heart marvellous and yet not strange  fair lady goldberry  he said again
 now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer than clear water

o reed by the living pool fair river daughter

o spring time and summer time and spring again after

o wind on the waterfall and the leaves  laughter 
suddenly he stopped and stammered overcome with surprise to hear himself
saying such things but goldberry laughed
 welcome  she said  i had not heard that folk of the shire were so
sweet tongued but i see you are an elf friend the light in your eyes and the
ring in your voice tells it this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for the
master of the house he will not be long he is tending your tired beasts 
the hobbits sat down gladly in low rush seated chairs while goldberry busied
herself about the table and their eyes followed her for the slender grace of
her movement filled them with quiet delight from somewhere behind the house
came the sound of singing every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated
words
old tom bombadil is a merry fellow

bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow
 fair lady  said frodo again after a while  tell me if my asking
does not seem foolish who is tom bombadil 
 he is  said goldberry staying her swift movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly  he is as you have seen him  she
said in answer to his look  he is the master of wood water and hill 
 then all this strange land belongs to him 
 no indeed  she answered and her smile faded  that would indeed be a
burden  she added in a low voice as if to herself  the trees and the
grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves
tom bombadil is the master no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow he
has no fear tom bombadil is master 
a door opened and in came tom bombadil he had now no hat and his thick brown
hair was crowned with autumn leaves he laughed and going to goldberry took
her hand
 here s my pretty lady  he said bowing to the hobbits  here s my
goldberry clothed all in silver green with flowers in her girdle is the table
laden i see yellow cream and honeycomb and white bread and butter milk
cheese and green herbs and ripe berries gathered is that enough for us is the
supper ready 
 it is  said goldberry  but the guests perhaps are not 
tom clapped his hands and cried  tom tom your guests are tired and you
had near forgotten come now my merry friends and tom will refresh you you
shall clean grimy hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy cloaks
and comb out your tangles 
he opened the door and they followed him down a short passage and round a
sharp turn they came to a low room with a sloping roof a penthouse it seemed
built on to the north end of the house its walls were of clean stone but they
were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains the floor was
flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes there were four deep mattresses
each piled with white blankets laid on the floor along one side against the
opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins and beside it
stood brown ewers filled with water some cold some steaming hot there were
soft green slippers set ready beside each bed
before long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at the table two
on each side while at either end sat goldberry and the master it was a long
and merry meal though the hobbits ate as only famished hobbits can eat there
was no lack the drink in their drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold water
yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices the guests
became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily as if it was easier and
more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly the guests were
commanded to sit quiet and were set in chairs each with a footstool to his
tired feet there was a fire in the wide hearth before them and it was burning
with a sweet smell as if it were built of apple wood when everything was set
in order all the lights in the room were put out except one lamp and a pair of
candles at each end of the chimney shelf then goldberry came and stood before
them holding a candle and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep
 have peace now  she said  until the morning heed no nightly noises
for nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the
wind off the hill top good night  she passed out of the room with a glimmer
and a rustle the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away
downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside them in silence while each of them tried to muster
the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids at last frodo spoke
 did you hear me calling master or was it just chance that brought you at
that moment 
tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream  eh
what  said he  did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy
singing just chance brought me then if chance you call it it was no plan of
mine though i was waiting for you we heard news of you and learned that you
were wandering we guessed you d come ere long down to the water all paths
lead that way down to withywindle old grey willow man he s a mighty singer
and it s hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes but tom had an
errand there that he dared not hinder  tom nodded as if sleep was taking him
again but he went on in a soft singing voice
i had an errand there gathering water lilies

green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady

the last ere the year s end to keep them from the winter

to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted

each year at summer s end i go to find them for her

in a wide pool deep and clear far down withywindle

there they open first in spring and there they linger latest

by that pool long ago i found the river daughter

fair young goldberry sitting in the rushes

sweet was her singing then and her heart was beating
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue
and that proved well for you   for now i shall no longer

go down deep again along the forest water

not while the year is old nor shall i be passing

old man willow s house this side of spring time

not till the merry spring when the river daughter

dances down the withy path to bathe in the water
he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking one more question the
one he most desired to have answered  tell us master  he said  about
the willow man what is he i have never heard of him before 
 no don t  said merry and pippin together sitting suddenly upright
 not now not until the morning 
 that is right  said the old man  now is the time for resting some
things are ill to hear when the world s in shadow sleep till the
morning light rest on the pillow heed no nightly noise fear no grey
willow  and with that he took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping a
candle in either hand he led them out of the room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the blankets were of
white wool they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light
covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light then he saw the young
moon rising under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate it seemed to frodo that he was lifted
up and passing over he saw that the rock wall was a circle of hills and that
within it was a plain and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone
like a vast tower but not made by hands on its top stood the figure of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in
his white hair as the wind stirred it up from the dark plain below came the
crying of fell voices and the howling of many wolves suddenly a shadow like
the shape of great wings passed across the moon the figure lifted his arms and
a light flashed from the staff that he wielded a mighty eagle swept down and
bore him away the voices wailed and the wolves yammered there was a noise like
a strong wind blowing and on it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping
galloping galloping from the east  black riders  thought frodo as he
wakened with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind he wondered if
he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent and at last he
turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream
at his side pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change came over his dreams
and he turned and groaned suddenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet
still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream tip tap
squeak the noise was like branches fretting in the wind twig fingers
scraping wall and window creak creak creak he wondered if there were
willow trees close to the house and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling
that he was not in an ordinary house at all but inside the willow and listening
to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again he sat up and felt
the soft pillows yield to his hands and he lay down again relieved he seemed
to hear the echo of words in his ears  fear nothing have peace until the
morning heed no nightly noises  then he went to sleep again
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling into his quiet sleep
water streaming down gently and then spreading spreading irresistibly all
round the house into a dark shoreless pool it gurgled under the walls and was
rising slowly but surely  i shall be drowned  he thought it will find its
way in and then i shall drown  he felt that he was lying in a soft slimy
bog and springing up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again he seemed to hear or
remember hearing  nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and
starlight and the wind off the hill top  a little breath of sweet air moved
the curtain he breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept through the night in deep content if
logs are contented
they woke up all four at once in the morning light tom was moving about
the room whistling like a starling when he heard them stir he clapped his
hands and cried  hey come merry dol derry dol my hearties  he drew
back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that these had covered the
windows at either end of the room one looking east and the other looking west
they leapt up refreshed frodo ran to the eastern window and found himself
looking into a kitchen garden grey with dew he had half expected to see turf
right up to the walls turf all pocked with hoof prints actually his view was
screened by a tall line of beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise it was a pale morning in
the east behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges
lay glimmering deeps of yellow the sky spoke of rain to come but the light was
broadening quickly and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the
wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist the forest
was hidden under a fog it was like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from
above there was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes
and billows the valley of the withywindle the stream ran down the hill on the
left and vanished into the white shadows near at hand was a flower garden and a
clipped hedge silver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with
dew drops there was no willow tree to be seen
 good morning merry friends  cried tom opening the eastern window
wide a cool air flowed in it had a rainy smell  sun won t show her face
much today i m thinking i have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops
since the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass underfoot wet sky
above me i wakened goldberry singing under window but nought wakes hobbit folk
in the early morning in the night little folk wake up in the darkness and
sleep after light has come ring a ding dillo wake now my merry friends
forget the nightly noises ring a ding dillo del derry del my hearties if you
come soon you ll find breakfast on the table if you come late you ll get
grass and rain water 
needless to say   not that tom s threat sounded very serious   the hobbits
came soon and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo look rather
empty neither tom nor goldberry were there tom could be heard about the house
clattering in the kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and
there outside the room looked westward over the mist clouded valley and the
window was open water dripped down from the thatched eaves above before they
had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof and a
straight grey rain came softly and steadily down behind its deep curtain the
forest was completely veiled
as they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was
flowing down the rain out of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up
above them they could hear few words but it seemed plain to them that the song
was a rain song as sweet as showers on dry hills that told the tale of a river
from the spring in the highlands to the sea far below the hobbits listened with
delight and frodo was glad in his heart and blessed the kindly weather
because it delayed them from departing the thought of going had been heavy upon
him from the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they would not go further
that day
the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to
spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the downs nothing could be seen all
round the house but falling water frodo stood near the open door and watched
the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down
into the valley tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house
waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain   and indeed when he sprang
over the threshold he seemed quite dry except for his boots these he took off
and put in the chimney corner then he sat in the largest chair and called the
hobbits to gather round him
 this is goldberry s washing day  he said  and her autumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit folk   let them rest while they are able it s a good day
for long tales for questions and for answers so tom will start the talking 
he then told them many remarkable stories sometimes half as if speaking to
himself sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his
deep brows often his voice would turn to song and he would get out of his
chair and dance about he told them tales of bees and flowers the ways of
trees and the strange creatures of the forest about the evil things and good
things things friendly and things unfriendly cruel things and kind things and
secrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they began to understand the lives of the forest apart
from themselves indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other
things were at home moving constantly in and out of his talk was old man
willow and frodo learned now enough to content him indeed more than enough
for it was not comfortable lore tom s words laid bare the hearts of trees and
their thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with a hatred of
things that go free upon the earth gnawing biting breaking hacking burning
destroyers and usurpers it was not called the old forest without reason for it
was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods and in it there lived
yet ageing no quicker than the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees
remembering times when they were lords the countless years had filled them with
pride and rooted wisdom and with malice but none were more dangerous than the
great willow his heart was rotten but his strength was green and he was
cunning and a master of winds and his song and thought ran through the woods
on both sides of the river his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible twig fingers in
the air till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the forest from
the hedge to the downs
suddenly tom s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream
over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn rocks and among small flowers
in close grass and wet crannies wandering at last up on to the downs they
heard of the great barrows and the green mounds and the stone rings upon the
hills and in the hollows among the hills sheep were bleating in flocks green
walls and white walls rose there were fortresses on the heights kings of
little kingdoms fought together and the young sun shone like fire on the red
metal of their new and greedy swords there was victory and defeat and towers
fell fortresses were burned and flames went up into the sky gold was piled on
the biers of dead kings and queens and mounds covered them and the stone doors
were shut and the grass grew over all sheep walked for a while biting the
grass but soon the hills were empty again a shadow came out of dark places far
away and the bones were stirred in the mounds barrow wights walked in the
hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the
wind  stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the
moonlight
the hobbits shuddered even in the shire the rumour of the barrow wights of
the barrow downs beyond the forest had been heard but it was not a tale that
any hobbit liked to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away these
four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their
minds the house of tom bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those
dreaded hills they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily looking
aside at one another
when they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into
strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought into limes
when the world was wider and the seas flowed straight to the western shore and
still on and back tom went singing out into ancient starlight when only the
elf sires were awake then suddenly he slopped and they saw that he nodded as
if he was falling asleep the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it
seemed as if under the spell of his words the wind had gone and the clouds
had dried up and the day had been withdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed frodo
could not tell he did not feel either hungry or tired only filled with wonder
the stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be
round him he spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence
 who are you master  he asked
 eh what  said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom
 don t you know my name yet that s the only answer tell me who are you
alone yourself and nameless but you are young and i am old eldest that s
what i am mark my words my friends tom was here before the river and the
trees tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn he made paths
before the big people and saw the little people arriving he was here before
the kings and the graves and the barrow wights when the elves passed westward
tom was here already before the seas were bent he knew the dark under the
stars when it was fearless   before the dark lord came from outside 
a shadow seemed to pass by the window and the hobbits glanced hastily
through the panes when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind
framed in light she held a candle shielding its flame from the draught with
her hand and the light flowed through it like sunlight through a white shell
 the rain has ended  she said  and new waters are running downhill
under the stars let us now laugh and be glad 
 and let us have food and drink  cried tom  long tales are thirsty
and long listening s hungry work morning noon and evening  with that he
jumped out of his chair and with a bound took a candle from the chimney shelf
and lit it in the flame that goldberry held then he danced about the table
suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he returned bearing a large and laden tray then tom and goldberry
set the table and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter so fair
was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of tom yet in
some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance neither hindering the other
in and out of the room and round about the table and with great speed food and
vessels and lights were set in order the boards blazed with candles white and
yellow tom bowed to his guests  supper is ready  said goldberry and now
the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle and her
shoes were like fishes  mail but tom was all in clean blue blue as
rain washed forget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than before the hobbits under the spell of
tom s words may have missed one meal or many but when the food was before
them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten they did not sing or even
speak much for a while and paid close attention to business but after a time
their hearts and spirit rose high again and their voices rang out in mirth and
laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them songs that began
merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence and in the silences they
saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known and looking
into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions
he appeared already to know much about them and all their families and
indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the shire down from days
hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves it no longer surprised them but
he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined
 there s earth under his old feet and clay on his fingers wisdom in his
bones and both his eyes are open  said tom it was also clear that tom had
dealings with the elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had reached
him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was his questioning that frodo
found himself telling him more about bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he
had told before even to gandalf tom wagged his head up and down and there was
a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders
 show me the precious ring  he said suddenly in the midst of the story
and frodo to his own astonishment drew out the chain from his pocket and
unfastening the ring handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown skinned
hand then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed for a second the hobbits
had a vision both comical and alarming of his bright blue eye gleaming through
a circle of gold then tom put the ring round the end of his little finger and
held it up to the candlelight for a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange
about this then they gasped there was no sign of tom disappearing
tom laughed again and then he spun the ring in the air   and it vanished
with a flash frodo gave a cry   and tom leaned forward and handed it back to
him with a smile
frodo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously like one who has lent a
trinket to a juggler it was the same ring or looked the same and weighed the
same for that ring had always seemed to frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the
hand but something prompted him to make sure he was perhaps a trifle annoyed
with tom for seeming to make so light of what even gandalf thought so perilously
important he waited for an opportunity when the talk was going again and tom
was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways   then he slipped
the ring on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start and checked an
exclamation frodo was delighted in a way it was his own ring all right for
merry was staring blankly at his chair and obviously could not see him he got
up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door
 hey there  cried tom glancing towards him with a most seeing look in
his shining eyes  hey come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadil s not as blind as that yet take off your golden ring your hand s
more fair without it come back leave your game and sit down beside me we must
talk a while more and think about the morning tom must teach the right road
and keep your feet from wandering 
frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off the ring he came and
sat down again tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine tomorrow
and it would be a glad morning and setting out would be hopeful but they would
do well to start early for weather in that country was a thing that even tom
could not be sure of for long and it would change sometimes quicker than he
could change his jacket  i am no weather master  he said  nor is aught
that goes on two legs 
by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house over the
western and lower slopes of the downs they might hope in that way to strike the
east road in a day s journey and avoid the barrows he told them not to be
afraid   but to mind their own business
 keep to the green grass don t you go a meddling with old stone or cold
wights or prying in their houses unless you be strong folk with hearts that
never falter  he said this more than once and he advised them to pass
barrows by on the west side if they chanced to stray near one then he taught
them a rhyme to sing if they should by ill luck fall into any danger or
difficulty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo

by water wood and hill by the reed and willow

by fire sun and moon harken now and hear us

come tom bombadil for our need is near us
when they had sung this altogether after him he clapped them each on the
shoulder with a laugh and taking candles led them back to their bedroom
 
that night they heard no noises but either in his dreams or out of them he
could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind a song
that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growing
stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver until at last it was rolled
back and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling like a tree full
of birds and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open
window outside everything was green and pale gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready to say farewell
as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning cool bright and
clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue the air came fresh from the
north west their quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving
restlessly tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the
doorstep bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed
they rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house and went
slanting up towards the north end of the hill brow under which it sheltered
they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope when
suddenly frodo stopped
goldberry he cried my fair lady clad all in silver green we have never
said farewell to her nor seen her since the evening he was so distressed that
he turned back but at that moment a clear call came rippling down there on the
hill brow she stood beckoning to them her hair was flying loose and as it
caught the sun it shone and shimmered a light like the glint of water on dewy
grass flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened up the last slope and stood breathless beside her they bowed
but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round and they looked out from
the hill top over lands under the morning it was now as clear and far seen as
it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the forest which
could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the west in
that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green yellow russet under the
sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine to the south over
the line of the withywindle there was a distant glint like pale glass where the
brandywine river made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the
knowledge of the hobbits northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away
in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth colours until it faded
into a featureless and shadowy distance eastward the barrow downs rose ridge
behind ridge into the morning and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of
the sky but it spoke to them out of memory and old tales of the high and
distant mountains
they took a deep draught of the air and felt that a skip and a few stout
strides would bear them wherever they wished it seemed fainthearted to go
jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the road when they
should be leaping as lusty as tom over the stepping stones of the hills
straight towards the mountains
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts speed now
fair guests she said and hold to your purpose north with the wind in the
left eye and a blessing on your footsteps make haste while the sun shines and
to frodo she said farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting
but frodo found no words to answer he bowed low and mounted his pony and
followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill tom
bombadils house and the valley and the forest were lost to view the air grew
warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside and the scent of turf
rose strong and sweet as they breathed turning back when they reached the
bottom of the green hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching them and her
hands were stretched out towards them as they looked she gave a clear call and
lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and round the green feet of a
steep hill into another deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of
further hills and down their long limbs and up their smooth sides again up on
to new hill tops and down into new valleys there was no tree nor any visible
water it was a country of grass and short springy turf silent except for the
whisper of the air over the edges of the land and high lonely cries of strange
birds as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot each time they climbed a
ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less when they caught a glimpse of the
country westward the distant forest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen rain
was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould a shadow now lay round the
edge of sight a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap hot
and heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened like a
shallow saucer with a green mounded rim inside there was no air stirring and
the sky seemed near their heads they rode across and looked northwards then
their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they had come further already than
they had expected certainly the distances had now all become hazy and
deceptive but there could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end a
long valley lay below them winding away northwards until it came to an opening
between two steep shoulders beyond there seemed to be no more hills due north
they faintly glimpsed a long dark line that is a line of trees said merry
and that must mark the road all along it for many leagues east of the bridge
there are trees growing some say they were planted in the old days
splendid said frodo  if we make as good going this afternoon as we have
done this morning we shall have left the downs before the sun sets and be
jogging on in search of a camping place but even as he spoke he turned his
glance eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked
down upon them and all those hills were crowned with green mounds and on some
were standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums
that view was somehow disquieting so they turned from the sight and went
down into the hollow circle in the midst of it there stood a single stone
standing tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow it was
shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or a guarding finger or more
like a warning but they were now hungry and the sun was still at the fearless
noon so they set their backs against the east side of the stone it was cool
as if the sun had had no power to warm it but at that time this seemed
pleasant there they took food and drink and made as good a noon meal under the
open sky as anyone could wish for the food came from down under hill tom had
provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day their ponies unburdened
strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm sun and the scent of
turf lying a little too long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky
above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had
never meant to take the standing stone was cold and it cast a long pale shadow
that stretched eastward over them the sun a pale and watery yellow was
gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they
lay north south and east beyond the wall the fog was thick cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chill their ponies were standing crowded together
with their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim they
found that they were upon an island in the fog even as they looked out in
dismay towards the setting sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea and
a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind the fog rolled up to the walls
and rose above them and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became
a roof they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing
stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about them but they did not quite lose
heart they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the
road ahead and they still knew in which direction it lay in any case they now
had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of
remaining there was in their minds they packed up as quickly as their chilled
fingers would work
soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the
long northward slope of the hill down into a foggy sea as they went down the
mist became colder and damper and their hair hung lank and dripping on their
foreheads when they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got
out cloaks and hoods which soon became bedewed with grey drops then mounting
their ponies they went slowly on again feeling their way by the rise and fall
of the ground they were steering as well as they could guess for the
gate like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had
seen in the morning once they were through the gap they had only lo keep on in
anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did not go beyond that except for a vague hope that perhaps away
beyond the downs there might be no fog
their going was very slow to prevent their getting separated and wandering
in different directions they went in file with frodo leading sam was behind
him and after him came pippin and then merry the valley seemed to stretch on
endlessly suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign on either side ahead a darkness
began to loom through the mist and he guessed that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs if they
could pass that they would be free
come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried
forward but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm the dark patches
grew darker but they shrank and suddenly he saw towering ominous before him
and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door
two huge standing stones he could not remember having seen any sign of these in
the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning he had passed
between them almost before he was aware and even as he did so darkness seemed
to fall round him his pony reared and snorted and he fell off when he looked
back he found that he was alone the others had not followed him sam he
called pippin merry come along why dont you keep up
there was no answer fear took him and he ran back past the stones shouting
wildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thought he heard a cry hoy frodo
hoy it was away eastward on his left as he stood under the great stones
staring and straining into the gloom he plunged off in the direction of the
call and found himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kept on calling more and more
frantically but he heard no answer for some time and then it seemed faint and
far ahead and high above him frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the
mist and then a cry that sounded like help help often repeated ending
with a last help that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries but the light
was now gone and clinging night had closed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direction he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up
only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at
last came to the top of a ridge or hill he was weary sweating and yet chilled
it was wholly dark
where are you he cried out miserably
there was no reply he stood listening he was suddenly aware that it was
getting very cold and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind a
change was coming in the weather the mist was flowing past him now in shreds
and tatters his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid
the strands of hurrying cloud and fog the wind began to hiss over the grass
he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and he made towards it
and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside and the
starry sky was unveiled a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards
and was on a round hill top which he must have climbed from the north out of
the east the biting wind was blowing to his right there loomed against the
westward stars a dark black shape a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried again both angry and afraid
here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to come out of the ground
i am waiting for you
no said frodo but he did not run away his knees gave and he fell on the
ground nothing happened and there was no sound trembling he looked up in
time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars it leaned over
him he thought there were two eyes very cold though lit with a pale light that
seemed to come from some remote distance then a grip stronger and colder than
iron seized him the icy touch froze his bones and he remembered no more
when he came to himself again for a moment he could recall nothing except a
sense of dread then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow a barrow wight had taken him and he was probably already
under the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales
spoke he dared not move but lay as he found himself flat on his back upon a
cold stone with his hands on his breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very
darkness that was round him he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories of their jogging along together in the lanes of the
shire and talking about roads and adventures there is a seed of courage hidden
often deeply it is true in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit
wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow frodo was neither
very fat nor very timid indeed though he did not know it bilbo and gandalf
had thought him the best hobbit in the shire he thought he had come to the end
of his adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him he found
himself stiffening as if for a final spring he no longer felt limp like a
helpless prey
as he lay there thinking and getting a hold of himself he noticed all at
once that the darkness was slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing
round him it did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in for the
light seemed to be coming out of himself and from the floor beside him and had
not yet reached the roof or wall he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merry they were on their backs and their
faces looked deathly pale and they were clad in white about them lay many
treasures of gold maybe though in that light they looked cold and unlovely on
their heads were circlets gold chains were about their waists and on their
fingers were many rings swords lay by their sides and shields were at their
feet but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling the voice seemed
far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high in the air and thin sometimes
like a low moan from the ground out of the formless stream of sad but horrible
sounds strings of words would now and again shape themselves grim hard cold
words heartless and miserable the night was railing against the morning of
which it was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it
hungered frodo was chilled to the marrow after a while the song became
clearer and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an
incantation
cold be hand and heart and bone

and cold be sleep under stone

never mare to wake on stony bed

never till the sun fails and the moon is dead

in the black wind the stars shall die

and still on gold here let them lie

till the dark lord lifts his hand

over dead sea and withered land
he heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound raising himself on
one arm he looked and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of
passage which behind them turned a corner round the corner a long arm was
groping walking on its fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the
incantation then a wild thought of escape came to him he wondered if he put on
the ring whether the barrow wight would miss him and he might find some way
out he thought of himself running free over the grass grieving for merry and
sam and pippin but free and alive himself gandalf would admit that there had
been nothing else he could do
but the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong he could
not leave his friends so easily he wavered groping in his pocket and then
fought with himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer suddenly
resolve hardened in him and he seized a short sword that lay beside him and
kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions with what strength he
had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but at
the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt there was a shriek and the
light vanished in the dark there was a snarling noise
frodo fell forward over merry and merrys face felt cold all at once back
into his mind from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog
came the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing he
remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them in a small desperate voice he
began ho tom bombadil and with that name his voice seemed to grow
strong it had a full and lively sound and the dark chamber echoed as if to
drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo

by water wood and hill by the reed and willow

by fire sun and moon harken now and hear us

come tom bombadil for our need is near us
there was a sudden deep silence in which frodo could hear his heart beating
after a long slow moment he heard plain but far away as if it was coming down
through the ground or through thick walls an answering voice singing
old tom bombadil is a merry fellow

bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow

none has ever caught him yet for tom he is the master

his songs are stronger songs and his feet are faster
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling and falling and
suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day a low door like
opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond frodos feet and there was
toms head hat feather and all framed against the light of the sun rising
red behind him the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces of the three
hobbits lying beside frodo they did not stir but the sickly hue had left them
they looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark chamber singing
get out you old wight vanish in the sunlight

shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go wailing

out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains

come never here again leave your barrow empty

lost and forgotten be darker than the darkness

where gates stand for ever shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell
in with a crash then there was a long trailing shriek fading away into an
unguessable distance and after that silence
come friend frodo said tom let us get out on to clean grass you must
help me bear them
together they carried out merry pippin and sam as frodo left the barrow
for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded spider in a heap of fallen earth tom went back in again and there was
a sound of much thumping and stamping when he came out he was bearing in his
arms a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper and bronze many
beads and chains and jewelled ornaments he climbed the green barrow and laid
them all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair and looked
down upon the three hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at
the west side of the mound raising his right hand he said in a clear and
commanding voice
wake now my merry tads wake and hear me calling

warm now be heart and limb the cold stone is fallen

dark door is standing wide dead hand is broken

night under night is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms rubbed their
eyes and then suddenly sprang up they looked about in amazement first at
frodo and then at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above them and
then at themselves in their thin white rags crowned and belted with pale gold
and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of wonder began merry feeling the golden circlet that
had slipped over one eye then he stopped and a shadow came over his face and
he closed his eyes of course i remember he said the men of carn dûm
came on us at night and we were worsted ah the spear in my heart he
clutched at his breast no no he said opening his eyes what am i saying
i have been dreaming where did you get to frodo
 i thought that i was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think of what we are to do now let us go on
dressed up like this sir said sam where are my clothes he flung his
circlet belt and rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if he
expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and other hobbit garments
lying somewhere to hand
you wont find your clothes again said tom bounding down from the mound
and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight one would have thought
that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened and indeed the horror faded out
of their hearts as they looked at him and saw the merry glint in his eyes
what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half
amused why not
but tom shook his head saying youve found yourselves again out of the
deep water clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning be glad
my merry friends and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb cast off
these cold rags run naked on the grass while tom goes a hunting
he sprang away down hill whistling and calling looking down
after him frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between
their hill and the next still whistling and crying
hey now come hoy now whither do you wander

up down near or far here there or yonder

sharp ears wise nose swish tail and bumpkin

white socks my little lad and old fatty lumpkin
so he sang running fast tossing up his hat and catching it until he was
hidden by a fold of the ground but for some time his hey now hoy now came
floating back down the wind which had shifted round towards the south
the air was growing very warm again the hobbits ran about for a while on the
grass as he told them then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of
those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime or
of people that after being long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that
they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise
by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry he
reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill and behind him came in an
obedient line six ponies their own five and one more the last was
plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger stronger fatter and older than
their own ponies merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact given
them any such names but they answered to the new names that tom had given them
for the rest of their lives tom called them one by one and they climbed over
the brow and stood in a line then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said theyve more sense in some ways than
you wandering hobbits have   more sense in their noses for they sniff danger
ahead which you walk right into and if they run to save themselves then they
run the right way you must forgive them all for though their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not what they were made for see
here they come again bringing all their burdens
merry sam and pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their
packs and they soon felt too hot for they were obliged to put on some of the
thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter
where does that other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked
frodo
hes mine said tom my four legged friend though i seldom ride him and
he wanders often far free upon the hillsides when your ponies stayed with me
they got to know my lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and quickly ran to
meet him i thought hed look for them and with his words of wisdom take all
their fear away but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride hey hes
coming with you just to set you on the road so he needs a pony for you cannot
easily talk to hobbits that are riding when youre on your own legs trying to
trot beside them
the hobbits were delighted to hear this and thanked tom many times but he
laughed and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not
feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land  ive got
things to do he said my making and my singing my talking and my walking
and my watching of the country tom cant be always near to open doors and
willow cracks tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
it was still fairly early by the sun something between nine and ten and the
hobbits turned their minds to food their last meal had been lunch beside the
standing stone the day before they breakfasted now off the remainder of toms
provisions meant for their supper with additions that tom had brought with
him it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the circumstances but
they felt much better for it while they were eating tom went up to the mound
and looked through the treasures most of these he made into a pile that
glistened and sparkled on the grass he bade them lie there free to all
finders birds beasts elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the
spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no wight ever come back to
it he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones
many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies he looked long
at it as if stirred by some memory shaking his head and saying at last
here is a pretty toy for tom and for his lady fair was she who long ago
wore this on her shoulder goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget
her
for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger long leaf shaped and keen of
marvellous workmanship damasked with serpent forms in red and gold they
gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths wrought of some strange metal
light and strong and set with many fiery stones whether by some virtue in
these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound the blades seemed
untouched by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit people he said sharp
blades are good to have if shire folk go walking east south or far away into
dark and danger then he told them that these blades were forged many long
years ago by men of westernesse they were foes of the dark lord but they were
overcome by the evil king of carn dûm in the land of angmar
few now remember them tom murmured yet still some go wandering sons of
forgotten kings walking in loneliness guarding from evil things folk that are
heedless
the hobbits did not understand his words but as he spoke they had a vision
as it were of a great expanse of years behind them like a vast shadowy plain
over which there strode shapes of men tall and grim with bright swords and
last came one with a star on his brow then the vision faded and they were back
in the sunlit world it was time to start again they made ready packing their
bags and lading their ponies their new weapons they hung on their leather belts
under their jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they would be
of any use fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the
adventures in which their flight would land them
at last they set off they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting
they trotted quickly along the valley they looked back and saw the top of the
old mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a
yellow flame then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from
view
though frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great
stones standing like a gate and before long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them it was a merry journey
with tom bombadil trotting gaily beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin
who could move much faster than his girth promised tom sang most of the time
but it was chiefly nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and
delight
they went forward steadily but they soon saw that the road was further away
than they had imagined even without a fog their sleep at mid day would have
prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before the
dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on
the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side tom said that it
had once been the boundary of a kingdom but a very long lime ago he seemed to
remember something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall and then
tom turned due north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west the land
was now open and fairly level and they quickened their pace but the sun was
already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead and they
knew that they had come back to the road after many unexpected adventures they
galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted under the long shadows
of the trees they were on the top of a sloping bank and the road now dim as
evening drew on wound away below them at this point it ran nearly from
south west to north east and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide
hollow it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain there were
pools and pot holes full of water they rode down the bank and looked up and
down there was nothing to be seen well here we are again at last said
frodo i suppose we havent lost more than two days by my short cut through the
forest but perhaps the delay will prove useful   it may have put them off our
trail
the others looked at him the shadow of the fear of the black riders came
suddenly over them again ever since they had entered the forest they had
thought chiefly of getting back to the road only now when it lay beneath their
feet did they remember the danger which pursued them and was more than likely
to be lying in wait for them upon the road itself they looked anxiously back
towards the setting sun but the road was brown and empty
do you think asked pippin hesitatingly do you think we may be pursued
tonight
no i hope not tonight answered tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do not trust my guess for i cannot tell for certain out east my knowledge
fails tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them they felt that he
would know how to deal with black riders if anyone did they would soon now be
going forward into lands wholly strange to them and beyond all but the most
vague and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering twilight they
longed for home a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them they stood
silent reluctant to make the final parting and only slowly became aware that
tom was wishing them farewell and telling them to have good heart and to ride
on till dark without halting
tom will give you good advice till this day is over after that your own
luck must go with you and guide you four miles along the road youll come upon
a village bree under bree hill with doors looking westward there youll find
an old inn that is called the prancing pony barliman butterbur is the
worthy keeper there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning will
speed you upon your way be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and ride
to meet your fortune
they begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with
them but he laughed and refused saying
toms country ends here he will not pass the borders

tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins back and rode up over
the bank and away singing into the dusk
the hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight
 i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam hes a caution
and no mistake i reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better
nor queerer but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing pony he
spoke of i hope itll be like the green dragon away back home what sort
of folk are they in bree
 there are hobbits in bree said merry as well as big folk i daresay it
will be homelike enough the pony is a good inn by all accounts my
people ride out there now and again
 it may be all we could wish said frodo but it is outside the shire all
the same dont make yourselves too much at home please remember  all of you  
that the name of baggins must not be mentioned i am mr underhill if any name
must be given
they now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and up again until
at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose bree hill barring the way a dark mass against misty stars
and under its western flank nestled a large village towards it they now hurried
desiring only to find a fire and a door between them and the night
 
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small inhabited region like
an island in the empty lands round about besides bree itself there was staddle
on the other side of the hill combe in a deep valley a little further eastward
and archet on the edge of the chetwood lying round bree hill and the villages
was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad
the men of bree were brown haired broad and rather short cheerful and
independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but they were more friendly
and familiar with hobbits dwarves elves and other inhabitants of the world
about them than was or is usual with big people according to their own tales
they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of the first men
that ever wandered into the west of the middle world few had survived the
turmoils of the elder days but when the kings returned again over the great sea
they had found the bree men still there and they were still there now when the
memory of the old kings had faded into the grass
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west or within a
hundred leagues of the shire but in the wild lands beyond bree there were
mysterious wanderers the bree folk called them rangers and knew nothing of
their origin they were taller and darker than the men of bree and were believed
to have strange powers of sight and hearing and to understand the languages of
beasts and birds they roamed at will southwards and eastwards even as far as
the misty mountains but they were now few and rarely seen when they appeared
they brought news from afar and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly
listened to but the bree folk did not make friends of them
there were also many families of hobbits in the bree land and they claimed
to be the oldest settlement of hobbits in the world one that was founded long
before even the brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized they lived
mostly in staddle though there were some in bree itself especially on the
higher slopes of the hill above the houses of the men the big folk and the
little folk as they called one another were on friendly terms minding their
own affairs in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves as
necessary parts of the bree folk nowhere else in the world was this peculiar
but excellent arrangement to be found
the bree folk big and little did not themselves travel much and the
affairs of the four villages were their chief concern occasionally the hobbits
of bree went as far as buckland or the eastfarthing but though their link land
was not much further than a days riding east of the brandywine bridge the
hobbits of the shire now seldom visited it an occasional bucklander or
adventurous took would come out to the inn for a night or two but even that was
becoming less and less usual the shire hobbits referred to those of bree and
to any others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took very little
interest in them considering them dull and uncouth there were probably many
more outsiders scattered about in the west of the world in those days than the
people of the shire imagined some doubtless were no better than tramps ready
to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them but in the
bree land at any rate the hobbits were decent and prosperous and no more
rustic than most of their distant relatives inside it was not yet forgotten
that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the
shire and bree there was bree blood in the brandybucks by all accounts
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of the big folk mostly
above the road nestling on the hillside with windows looking west on that
side running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it there was
a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side over this the road crossed by
a causeway but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate there
was another gate in the southern comer where the road ran out of the village
the gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them were small lodges for
the gatekeepers
down on the road where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the
hill there was a large inn it had been built long ago when the traffic on the
roads had been far greater for bree stood at an old meeting of ways another
ancient road crossed the east road just outside he dike at the western end of
the village and in former days men and other folk of various sorts had
travelled much on it strange as news from bree was still a saying in the
eastfarthing descending from those days when news from north south and east
could be heard in the inn and when the shire hobbits used to go more often to
hear it but the northern lands had long been desolate and the north road was
now seldom used it was grass grown and the bree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and the innkeeper was an important
person his house was a meeting place for the idle talkative and inquisitive
among the inhabitants large and small of the four villages and a resort of
rangers and other wanderers and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still
journeyed on the east road to and from the mountains
it was dark and white stars were shining when frodo and his companions came
at last to the greenway crossing and drew near the village they came to the
west gate and found it shut but at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a
man sitting he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them
in surprise
what do you want and where do you come from he asked gruffly
we are making for the inn here answered frodo we are journeying east and
cannot go further tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the shire by their talk
said the gatekeeper softly as if speaking to himself he stared at them darkly
for a moment and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on the road at night he went on as
they halted a moment by his door youll pardon my wondering what business
takes you away east of bree what may your names be might i ask
our names and our business are our own and this does not seem a good place
to discuss them said frodo not liking the look of the man or the tone of his
voice
your business is your own no doubt said the man but its my business to
ask questions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at
the inn here put in merry i am mr brandybuck is that enough for you the
bree folk used to be fair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man i meant no offence but youll find
maybe that more folk than old harry at the gate will be asking you questions
theres queer folk about if you go on to the pony youll find youre
oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no more but frodo could see in the
lantern light that the man was still eyeing them curiously he was glad to hear
the gate clang to behind them as they rode forward he wondered why the man was
so suspicious and whether any one had been asking for news of a party of
hobbits could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while they were
delayed in the forest and the downs but there was something in the look and the
voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and then he went back to his
house as soon as his back was turned a dark figure climbed quickly in over the
gate and melted into the shadows of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a few detached houses and
drew up outside the inn the houses looked large and strange to them sam stared
up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and other creatures
even more terrifying some time or other in the course of his journey but at
the moment he was finding his first sight of men and their tall houses quite
enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day he pictured black
horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn yard and black riders
peering out of dark upper windows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night are we sir he
exclaimed if there are hobbit folk in these pans why dont we look for some
that would be willing to take us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo tom bombadil recommended it i
expect its homelike enough inside
even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes it
had a front on the road and two wings running back on land partly cut out of
the lower slopes of the hill so that at the rear the second floor windows were
level with the ground there was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the
two wings and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a
few broad steps the door was open and light streamed out of it above the arch
there was a lamp and beneath it swung a large signboard a fat white pony
reared up on its hind legs over the door was painted in white letters the
prancing pony by barliman butterbur many of the lower windows showed lights
behind thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom someone began singing a merry song
inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus they listened to
this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies the song
ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and leaving them standing in the yard
they climbed up the steps frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat
man with a bald head and a red face he had a white apron on and was bustling
out of one door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
can we  began frodo
half a minute if you please shouted the man over his shoulder and
vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke in a moment he was out
again wiping his hands on his apron
good evening little master he said bending down what may you be
wanting
beds for four and stabling for five ponies if that can be managed are you
mr butterbur
thats right barliman is my name barliman butterbur at your service
youre from the shire eh he said and then suddenly he clapped his hand to
his forehead as if trying to remember something hobbits he cried now what
does that remind me of might i ask your names sir
mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo and this is sam gamgee my name
is underhill
there now said mr butterbur snapping his fingers its gone again but
itll come back when i have time to think im run off my feet but ill see
what i can do for you we dont often get a party out of the shire nowadays and
i should be sorry not to make you welcome but there is such a crowd already in
the house tonight as there hasnt been for long enough it never rains but it
pours we say in bree
hi nob he shouted where are you you woolly footed slow coach nob
coming sir coming a cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a door and
seeing the travellers stopped short and stared at them with great interest
wheres bob asked the landlord you dont know well find him double
sharp i havent got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob theres five
ponies that have to be stabled he must find room somehow nob trotted off with
a grin and a wink
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his
forehead one thing drives out another so to speak im that busy tonight my
head is going round theres a party that came up the greenway from down south
last night   and that was strange enough to begin with then theres a
travelling company of dwarves going west come in this evening and now theres
you if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you but weve got a room
or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was
built on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows and all as they
like it i hope youll be comfortable youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be this way now
he led them a short way down a passage and opened a door here is a nice
little parlour he said i hope it will suit excuse me now im that busy no
time for talking i must be trotting its hard work for two legs but i dont
get thinner ill look in again later if you want anything ring the hand bell
and nob will come if he dont come ring and shout
off he went at last and left them feeling rather breathless he seemed
capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be they found
themselves in a small and cosy room there was a bit of bright fire burning on
the hearth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs there was a
round table already spread with a white cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustling in long before they thought of
ringing he brought candles and a tray full of plates
will you be wanting anything to drink masters he asked and shall i show
you the bedrooms while your supper is got ready
they were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when mr
butterbur and nob came in again in a twinkling the table was laid there was
hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new loaves slabs of butter and half a
ripe cheese good plain food as good as the shire could show and homelike
enough to dispel the last of sams misgivings already much relieved by the
excellence of the beer
the landlord hovered round for a link and then prepared to leave them i
dont know whether you would care to join the company when you have supped he
said standing at the door perhaps you would rather go to your beds still the
company would be very pleased to welcome you if you had a mind we dont
get outsiders   travellers from the shire i should say begging your pardon  
often and we like to hear a bit of news or any story or song you may have in
mind but as you please ring the bell if you lack anything
so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper about
three quarters of an hours steady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that
frodo pippin and sam decided to join the company merry said it would be too
stuffy i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit and perhaps go out
later for a sniff of the air mind your ps and qs and dont forget that you are
supposed to be escaping in secret and are still on the high road and not
very far from the shire
all right said pippin mind yourself dont get lost and dont forget
that it is safer indoors
the company was in the big common room of the inn the gathering was large
and mixed as frodo discovered when his eyes got used to the light this came
chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three lamps hanging from the beams were
dim and half veiled in smoke barliman butterbur was standing near the fire
talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange looking men on the
benches were various folk men of bree a collection of local hobbits sitting
chattering together a few more dwarves and other vague figures difficult to
make out away in the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus of welcome from the
bree landers the strangers especially those that had come up the greenway
stared at them curiously the landlord introduced the newcomers to the
bree folk so quickly that though they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the names belonged to the men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rushlight goatleaf heathertoes
appledore thistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur some of the hobbits
had similar names the mugworts for instance seemed numerous but most of them
had natural names such as banks brockhouse longholes sandheaver and
tunnelly many of which were used in the shire there were several underhills
from saddle and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related
they took frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitive and frodo soon
found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given he gave
out that he was interested in history and geography at which there was much
wagging of heads although neither of these words were much used in the
bree dialect he said he was thinking of writing a book at which there was
silent astonishment and that he and his friends wanted to collect
information about hobbits living outside the shire especially in the eastern
lands
at this a chorus of voices broke out if frodo had really wanted to write a
book and had had many ears he would have learned enough for several chapters
in a few minutes and if that was not enough he was given a whole list of
names beginning with old barliman here to whom he could go for further
information but after a time as frodo did not show any sign of writing
a book on the spot the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the
shire frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found himself sitting
alone in a comer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling flews
of a kind that was becoming only too familiar there was trouble away in the
south and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway were on the move
looking for lands where they could find some peace the bree folk were
sympathetic but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into
their little land one of the travellers a squint eyed ill favoured fellow was
foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves theyve a right
to live same as other folk he said loudly the local inhabitants did not look
pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this and it did not at the
moment seem to concern hobbits big folk could hardly beg for lodgings in
hobbit holes they were more interested in sam and pippin who were now feeling
quite at home and were chatting gaily about events in the shire pippin roused
a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the town
hole in michel delving will whitfoot the mayor and the fattest hobbit in the
westfarthing had been buried in chalk and came out like a floured dumpling
but there were several questions asked that made frodo a little uneasy one of
the bree landers who seemed to have been in the shire several times wanted to
know where the underhills lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strange looking weather beaten man sitting in
the shadows near the wall was also listening intently to the hobbit talk he
had a tall tankard in front of him and was smoking a long stemmed pipe
curiously carved his legs were stretched out before him showing high boots of
supple leather that fitted him well but had seen much wear and were now caked
with mud a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn close about
him and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his
face but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him
him said the landlord in an answering whisper cocking an eye without
turning his head i dont rightly know he is one of the wandering folk
 rangers we call them he seldom talks not but what he can tell a rare tale
when he has the mind he disappears for a month or a year and then he pops up
again he was in and out pretty often last spring but i havent seen him about
lately what his right name is ive never heard but hes known round here as
strider goes about at a great pace on his long shanks though he dont tell
nobody what cause he has to hurry but theres no accounting for east and west
as we say in bree meaning the rangers and the shire folk begging your pardon
funny you should ask about him but at that moment mr butterbur was called
away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained
frodo found that strider was now looking at him as if he had heard or
guessed all that had been said presently with a wave of his hand and a nod he
invited frodo to come over and sit by him as frodo drew near be threw back his
hood showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and in a pale stem
face a pair of keen grey eyes
i am called strider he said in a low voice i am very pleased to meet
you master   underhill if old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffly he felt far from comfortable under the stare of
those keen eyes
well master underhill said strider if i were you i should stop your
young friends from talking too much drink fire and chance meeting are
pleasant enough but well   this isnt the shire there are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he added with a wry smile seeing
frodos glance and there have been even stranger travellers through bree
lately he went on watching frodos face
frodo returned his gaze but said nothing and strider made no further sign
his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin to his alarm frodo became
aware that the ridiculous young took encouraged by his success with the fat
mayor of michel delving was now actually giving a comic account of bilbos
farewell party he was already giving an imitation of the speech and was
drawing near to the astonishing disappearance
frodo was annoyed it was a harmless enough tale for most of the local
hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the
river but some old butterbur for instance knew a thing or two and had
probably heard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishing it would bring the name
of baggins to their minds especially if there had been inquiries in bree after
that name
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do pippin was evidently much enjoying the
attention he was getting and had become quite forgetful of their danger frodo
had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the ring and
that might well be disastrous
you had better do something quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk the attention of
pippins audience was disturbed some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed
and clapped thinking that mr underhill had taken as much ale as was good for
him
frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was his habit when
making a speech fingering the things in his pocket he felt the ring on its
chain and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish
out of the silly situation it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him from outside from someone or something a the room he resisted the
temptation firmly and clasped the ring in his hand as if to keep a hold on it
and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief at any rate it gave
him no inspiration he spoke a few suitable words as they would have said in
the shire we are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception
and i venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of
friendship between the shire and bree and then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him a song shouted one of the
hobbits a song a song shouted all the others come on now master sing us
something that we havent heard before
for a moment frodo stood gaping then in desperation he began a ridiculous
song that bilbo had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of for he had
made up the words himself it was about an inn and that is probably why it
came into frodos mind just then here it is in full only a few words of it are
now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a merry old inn

beneath an old grey hill

and there they brew a beer so brown

that the man in the moon himself came down

one night to drink his fill



the ostler has a tipsy cat

that plays a five stringed fiddle

and up and down he runs his bow

now squeaking high now purring low

now sawing in the middle



the landlord keeps a little dog

that is mighty fond of jokes

when theres good cheer among the guests

he cocks an ear at all the jests

and laughs until he chokes



they also keep a horned cow

as proud as any queen

but music turns her head like ale

and makes her wave her tufted tail

and dance upon the green



and o the rows of silver dishes

and the store of silver spoons

for sunday* theres a special pair

and these they polish up with care

on saturday afternoons



the man in the moon was drinking deep

and the cat began to wail

a dish and a spoon on the table danced

the cow in the garden madly pranced

and the little dog chased his tail



the man in the moon took another mug

and then rolled beneath his chair

and there he dozed and dreamed of ale

till in the sky the stars were pale

and dawn was in the air



then the ostler said to his tipsy cat

 the white horses of the moon

they neigh and champ their silver bits

but their masters been and drowned his wits

and the sunll be rising soon 



so the cat on his fiddle played hey diddle diddle

a jig that would wake the dead

he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune

while the landlord shook the man in the moon

its after three he said



they rolled the man slowly up the hill

and bundled him into the moon

while his horses galloped up in rear

and the cow came capering like a deer

and a dish ran up with the spoon



now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle

the dog began to roar

the cow and the horses stood on their heads

the guests all bounded from their beds

and danced upon the floor



with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke

the cow jumped over the moon

and the little dog laughed to see such fun

and the saturday dish went off at a run

with the silver sunday spoon



the round moon rolled behind the hill

as the sun raised up her head

she* hardly believed her fiery eyes

for though it was day to her surprise

they all went back to bed
there was loud and long applause frodo had a good voice and the song
tickled their fancy wheres old barley they cried he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle and then wed have a dance they called
for more ale and began to shout lets have it again master come on now
once more
they made frodo have another drink and then begin his song again while many
of them joined in for the tune was well known and they were quick at picking
up words it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself he capered about
on the table and when he came a second time to the cow jumped over the moon
he leaped in the air much too vigorously for he came down bang into a tray
full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the table with a crash clatter and
bump the audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter and stopped short
a gaping silence for the singer disappeared he simply vanished as if he had
gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole
the local hobbits stared in amazement and then sprang to their feet and
shouted for barliman all the company drew away from pippin and sam who found
themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a
distance it was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a
travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose but there was one swarthy
bree lander who stood looking at them with a knowing and half mocking
expression that made them feel very uncomfortable presently he slipped out of
the door followed by the squint eyed southerner the two had been whispering
together a good deal during the evening harry the gatekeeper also went out just
behind them
frodo felt a fool not knowing what else to do he crawled away under the
tables to the dark comer by strider who sat unmoved giving no sign of his
thoughts frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ring how it came
to be on his finger he could not tell he could only suppose that he had been
handling it in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it had slipped on when
he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall for a moment he wondered if
the ring itself had not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to reveal
itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room he did not
like the looks of the men that had gone out
well said strider when he reappeared why did you do that worse than
anything your friends could have said you have put your foot in it or should i
say your finger
i dont know what you mean said frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we had better wait until the uproar
has died down then if you please mr baggins i should like a quiet
word with you
what about asked frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper name
a matter of some importance   to us both answered strider looking frodo
in the eye you may hear something to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconcerned ill talk to you
later
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace mr butterbur had come
trotting in and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of
the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastways i didnt see him if
you take my meaning he just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaking
you dont say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort and i mean what i say whats more
 theres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head there
was too much of that mr underhill to go vanishing into thin air or into thick
air as is more likely in this room
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where he will so long as he pays in
the morning theres mr took now hes not vanished
well i saw what i saw and i saw what i didnt said mugwort obstinately
and i say theres some mistake repeated butterbur picking up the tray and
gathering up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo i havent vanished here i am
ive just been having a few words with strider in the comer
he came forward into the firelight but most of the company backed away
even more perturbed than before they were not in the least satisfied by his
explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had
fallen most of the hobbits and the men of bree went off then and there in a
huff having no fancy for further entertainment that evening one or two gave
frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves the dwarves and the
two or three strange men that still remained got up and said good night to the
landlord but not to frodo and his friends before long no one was left but
strider who sat on unnoticed by the wall
mr butterbur did not seem much put out he reckoned very probably that his
house would be full again on many future nights until the present mystery had
been thoroughly discussed now what have you been doing mr underhill he
asked frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics
i am very sorry to have caused any trouble said frodo it was quite
unintentional i assure you a most unfortunate accident
all right mr underhill but if youre going to do any more tumbling or
conjuring or whatever it was youd best warn folk beforehand   and warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way  uncanny if you
understand me and we dont take to it all of a sudden
i shant be doing anything of the sort again mr butterbur i promise you
and now i think ill be getting to bed we shall be making an early start will
you see that our ponies are ready by eight oclock
very good but before you go i should like a word with you in private mr
underhill something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tell you i
hope that youll not take it amiss when ive seen to a thing or two ill come
along to your room if youre willing
certainly said frodo but his heart sank he wondered how many private
talks he would have before he got to bed and what they would reveal were these
people all in league against him he began to suspect even old butterburs fat
face of concealing dark designs
 
frodo pippin and sam made their way back to the parlour there was no
light merry was not there and the fire had burned low it was not until they
had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that
they discovered strider had come with them there he was calmly sitting in a
chair by the door
hallo said pippin who are you and what do you want
i am called strider he answered and though he may have forgotten it
your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advantage i believe said frodo
what have you to say
several things answered strider but of course i have my price
what do you mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alarmed i mean just this i will tell you what i know and give
you some good advice   but i shall want a reward
and what will that be pray said frodo he suspected now that he had
fallen in with a rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a
little money with him all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he could not
spare any of it
no more than you can afford answered strider with a slow smile as if he
guessed frodos thoughts just this you must take me along with you until i
wish to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprised but not much relieved even if i
wanted another companion i should not agree to any such thing until i knew a
good deal more about you and your business
excellent exclaimed strider crossing his legs and sitting back
comfortably you seem to be coming to your senses again and that is all to the
good you have been much too careless so far very well i will tell you what i
know and leave the reward to you you may be glad to grant it when you have
heard me
go on then said frodo what do you know
too much too many dark things said strider grimly but as for your
business   he got up and went to the door opened it quickly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and sat down again i have quick ears he went on
lowering his voice and though i cannot disappear i have hunted many wild and
wary things and i can usually avoid being seen if i wish now i was behind the
hedge this evening on the road west of bree when four hobbits came out of the
downlands i need not repeat all that they said to old bombadil or to one
another but one thing interested me please remember said one of them that
the name baggins must not be mentioned i am mr underhill if any name must be
given that interested me so much that i followed them here i slipped over
the gate just behind them maybe mr baggins has an honest reason for leaving
his name behind but if so i should advise him and his friends to be more
careful
i dont see what interest my name has for any one in bree said frodo
angrily and i have still to learn why it interests you mr strider may have
an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping but if so i should advise him to
explain it
well answered said strider laughing but the explanation is simple
i was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins i wanted to find him
quickly i had learned that he was carrying out of the shire well a secret
that concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from his seat and sam
jumped up with a scowl i shall take more care of the secret than you do and
care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them watch every shadow he
said in a low voice black horsemen have passed through bree on monday one
came down the greenway they say and another appeared later coming up the
greenway from the south
there was a silence at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought to have
guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said and the landlord
seems to have heard something why did he press us to join the company and why
on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought to have stayed quiet in here
it would have been better said strider i would have stopped your going
into the common room if i could but the innkeeper would not let me in to see
you or take a message
do you think he    began frodo
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur only he does not altogether
like mysterious vagabonds of my sort frodo gave him a puzzled look well i
have rather a rascally look have i not said strider with a curl of his lip
and a queer gleam in his eye but i hope we shall get to know one another
better when we do i hope you will explain what happened at the end of your
song for that little prank   
it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
i wonder said strider accident then that accident has made your
position dangerous
hardly more than it was already said frodo i knew these horsemen were
pursuing me but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone
away
you must not count on that said strider sharply they will return and
more are coming there are others i know their number i know these riders he
paused and his eyes were cold and hard and there are some folk in bree who
are not to be trusted he went on bill ferny for instance he has an evil
name in the bree land and queer folk call at his house you must have noticed
him among the company a swarthy sneering fellow he was very close with one of
the southern strangers and they slipped out together just after your
accident not all of those southerners mean well and as for ferny
he would sell anything to anybody or make mischief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident got to do with him said
frodo still determined not to understand striders hints
news of you of course answered strider an account of your performance
would be very interesting to certain people after that they would hardly need
to be told your real name it seems to me only too likely that they will hear of
it before this night is over is that enough you can do as you like about my
reward take me as a guide or not but i may say that i know all the lands
between the shire and the misty mountains for i have wandered over them for
many years i am older than i look i might prove useful you will have to leave
the open road after tonight for the horsemen will watch it night and day you
may escape from bree and be allowed to go forward while the sun is up but you
wont go far they will come on you in the wild in some dark place where there
is no help do you wish them to find you they are terrible
the hobbits looked at him and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as
if with pain and his hands clenched the arms of his chair the room was very
quiet and still and the light seemed to have grown dim for a while he sat with
unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the
night far away
there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow perhaps
i know more about these pursuers than you do you fear them but you do not fear
them enough yet tomorrow you will have to escape if you can strider can take
you by paths that are seldom trodden will you have him
there was a heavy silence frodo made no answer his mind was confused with
doubt and fear sam frowned and looked at his master and at last he broke out
with your leave mr frodo id say no this strider here he warns and he
says take care and i say yes to that and lets begin with him he comes
out of the wild and i never heard no good of such folk he knows something
thats plain and more than i like but its no reason why we should let him go
leading us out into some dark place far from help as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable strider did not reply to sam but
turned his keen eyes on frodo frodo caught his glance and looked away no he
said slowly i dont agree i think i think you are not really as you choose
to look you began to talk to me like the bree folk but your voice has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see why you should warn us to take care
and yet ask us to take you on trust why the disguise who are you what do you
really know about   about my business and how do you know it
the lesson in caution has been well learned said strider with a grim
smile but caution is one thing and wavering is another you will never get to
rivendell now on your own and to trust me is your only chance you must make up
your mind i will answer some of your questions if that will help you to do so
but why should you believe my story if you do not trust me already still here
it is   
at that moment there came a knock at the door mr butterbur had arrived with
candles and behind him was nob with cans of hot water strider withdrew into a
dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord putting the candles on
the table nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door
its like this he began hesitating and looking troubled if ive done
any harm im sorry indeed but one thing drives out another as youll admit
and im a busy man but first one thing and then another this week have jogged
my memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope you see i was asked to
look out for hobbits of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in
particular
and what has that got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly i wont give you away
but i was told that this baggins would be going by the name of underhill and i
was given a description that fits you well enough if i may say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwisely interrupting
a stout little fellow with red cheeks
he
ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean a wizard they say he is but
hes a good friend of mine whether or no but now i dont know what hell have
to say to me if i see him again turn all my ale sour or me into a block of
wood i shouldnt wonder hes a bit hasty still whats done cant be undone 
well what have you done said frodo getting impatient with the slow
unravelling of butterburs thoughts
where was i said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers ah yes
old gandalf three months back he walked right into my room without a knock barley
he says im off in the morning will you do something for me youve only to
name it i said im in a hurry said he and ive no time myself
but i want a message took to the shire have you anyone you can send and trust
to go i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
make it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur producing a letter from
his pocket and reading out the address slowly and proudly he valued his
reputation as a lettered man
mr frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire
a letter for me from gandalf cried frodo
ah said mr butterbur then your right name is baggins
it is said frodo and you had better give me that letter at once and
explain why you never sent it thats what you came to tell me i suppose
though youve taken a long time to come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled youre right master he said and i
beg your pardon and im mortal afraid of what gandalf will say if harm comes
of it but i didnt keep it back a purpose i put it by safe then i couldnt
find nobody willing to go to the shire next day nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare and then one thing after another drove it out of my
mind im a busy man ill do what i can to set matters right and if theres
any help i can give youve only to name it
leaving the letter aside i promised gandalf no less barley he says
to me this friend of mine from the shire he may be coming out this way
before long him and another hell be calling himself underhill mind that but
you need ask no questions and if im not with him he may be in trouble and he
may need help do whatever you can for him and ill be grateful he says
and here you are and trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these black men said the landlord lowering his voice theyre looking for
baggins and if they mean well then im a hobbit it was on monday and
all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming uncanny i called it nob
he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit
called baggins nobs hair was all stood on end i bid the black fellows be off
and slammed the door on them but theyve been asking the same question all the
way to archet i hear and that ranger strider hes been asking questions
too tried to get in here to see you before youd had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly coming forward into the light and much
trouble would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlord jumped with surprise you he cried youre always popping
up what do you want now
hes here with my leave said frodo he came to offer me his help
well you know your own business maybe said mr butterbur looking
suspiciously at strider but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a
ranger
then who would you take up with asked strider a fat innkeeper who only
remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day they cannot stay
in the pony for ever and they cannot go home they have a long road
before them will you go with them and keep the black men off
me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any money said mr butterbur
looking really scared but why cant you stay here quiet for a bit mr
underhill what are all these queer goings on what are these black men after
and where do they come from id like to know
im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo i am tired and very
worried and its a long tale but if you mean to help me i ought to warn you
that you will be in danger as long as i am in your house these black riders i
am not sure but i think i fear they come from   
they come from mordor said strider in a low voice from mordor barliman
if that means anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name evidently was known to
him that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time it is said
frodo are you still willing to help me i am said mr butterbur more
than ever though i dont know what the likes of me can do against against   
he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strider quietly not much barliman
but every little helps you can let mr underhill stay here tonight as mr
underhill and you can forget the name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butterbur but theyll find out hes here without help
from me im afraid its a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself this
evening to say no more the story of that mr bilbos going off has been heard
before tonight in bree even our nob has been doing some guessing in his slow
pate and there are others in bree quicker in the uptake than he is
well we can only hope the riders wont come back yet said frodo
i hope not indeed said butterbur but spooks or no spooks they wont
get in the pony so easy dont you worry till the morning nobll say no
word no black man shall pass my doors while i can stand on my legs me and my
folkll keep watch tonight but you had best get some sleep if you can
in any case we must be called at dawn said frodo we must get off as
early as possible breakfast at six thirty please
right ill see to the orders said the landlord good night mr baggins
  underhill i should say good night   now bless me wheres your mr
brandybuck
i dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety they had forgotten all about
merry and it was getting late i am afraid he is out he said something about
going for a breath of air
well you do want looking after and no mistake your party might be on a
holiday said butterbur i must go and bar the doors quick but ill see your
friend is let in when he comes id better send nob to look for him good night
to you all at last mr butterbur went out with another doubtful look at
strider and a shake of his head his footsteps retreated down the passage
well said strider when are you going to open that letter frodo looked
carefully at the seal before he broke it it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
inside written in the wizards strong but graceful script was the following
message
the prancing pony bree midyears day shire year 1418
dear frodo
bad news has reached me here i must go off at once you had better leave bag
end soon and get out of the shire before the end of july at latest i will
return as soon as i can and i will follow you if i find that you are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree you can trust the
landlord butterbur you may meet a friend of mine on the road a man lean
dark tall by some called strider he knows our business and will help you
make for rivendell there i hope we may meet again if
yours in haste
gandalf 
ps do not use it again not far any reason whatever do not travel by night

pps make sure that it is the real strider there are many strange men on the
roads his true name is aragorn 
all that is gold does not glitter

not all those who wander are lost

the old that is strong does not wither

deep roots are not reached by the frost

from the ashes a fire shall be woken

a light from the shadows shall spring

renewed shall be blade that was broken

the crownless again shall be king

ppps i hope butterbur sends this promptly a worthy man but his memory is
like a lumber roam
fare well
frodo read the letter to himself and then passed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur has made a mess of things he said he deserves
roasting if i had got this at once we might all have been safe in rivendell by
now but what can have happened to gandalf he writes as if he was going into
great danger
he has been doing that for many years said strider
frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wondering about gandalfs second
postscript why didnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friend at once he
asked it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed me till now said strider i knew
nothing of this letter for all i knew i had to persuade you to trust me without
proofs if i was to help you in any case i did not intend to tell you all
about myself at once i had to study you first and make sure of you the
enemy has set traps for me before now as soon as i had made up my mind i was
ready to tell you whatever you asked but i must admit he added with a queer
laugh that i hoped you would take to me for my own sake a hunted man
sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship but there i believe my
looks are against me
they are   at first sight at any rate laughed pippin with sudden relief
after reading gandalfs letter but handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire and i daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in
hedges and ditches
it would take more than a few days or weeks or years of wandering in the
wild to make you look like strider he answered and you would die first
unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider
dubiously how do we know you are the strider that gandalf speaks about he
demanded you never mentioned gandalf till this letter came out you might be
a play acting spy for all i can see trying to get us to go with you you might
have done in the real strider and took his clothes what have you to say to
that
that you are a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my only
answer to you sam gamgee is this if i had killed the real strider i could
kill you and i should have killed you already without so much talk if i was
after the ring i could have it   now
he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller in his eyes gleamed a light
keen and commanding throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the hilt of a
sword that had hung concealed by his side they did not dare to move sam sat
wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately he said looking down at
them with his face softened by a sudden smile i am aragorn son of arathorn
and if by life or death i can save you i will
there was a long silence at last frodo spoke with hesitation i believed
that you were a friend before the letter came he said or at least i wished
to you have frightened me several times tonight but never in the way that
servants of the enemy would or so i imagine i think one of his spies would  
well seem fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see laughed strider i look foul and feel fair is that it all that
is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost
did the verses apply to you then asked frodo i could not make out what
they were about but how did you know that they were in gandalfs letter if you
have never seen it
i did not know he answered but i am aragorn and those verses go with
that name he drew out his sword and they saw that the blade was indeed broken
a foot below the hilt not much use is it sam said strider but the time is
near when it shall be forged anew
sam said nothing
well said strider with sams permission we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide we shall have a rough road tomorrow even if we are
allowed to leave bree unhindered we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed
but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible i know one or two ways out of
bree land other than the main road if once we shake off the pursuit i shall
make for weathertop
weathertop said sam whats that
it is a hill just to the north of the road about half way from here to
rivendell it commands a wide view all round and there we shall have a chance
to look about us gandalf will make for that point if he follows us after
weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we shall have to choose
between various dangers
when did you last see gandalf asked frodo do you know where he is or
what he is doing
strider looked grave i do not know he said i came west with him in the
spring i have often kept watch on the borders of the shire in the last few
years when he was busy elsewhere he seldom left it unguarded we last met on
the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine he told me that his business
with you had gone well and that you would be starting for rivendell in the last
week of september as i knew he was at your side i went away on a journey of my
own and that has proved ill for plainly some news reached him and i was not
at hand to help
i am troubled for the first time since i have known him we should have had
messages even if he could not come himself when i returned many days ago i
heard the ill news the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was missing
and the horsemen had been seen it was the elven folk of gildor that told me
this and later they told me that you had left your home but there was no news
of your leaving buckland i have been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to do with it   with gandalfs
absence i mean asked frodo
i do not know of anything else that could have hindered him except the
enemy himself said strider but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know   as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys but this
business of ours will be his greatest task
pippin yawned i am sorry he said but i am dead tired in spite of all
the danger and worry i must go to bed or sleep where i sit where is that silly
fellow merry it would be the last straw if we had to go out in the dark to
look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam then feet came running along the
passage merry came in with a rush followed by nob he shut the door hastily
and leaned against it he was out of breath they stared at him in alarm for a
moment before he gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen them black
riders
black riders cried frodo where
here in the village i stayed indoors for an hour then as you did not come
back i went out for a stroll i had come back again and was standing just
outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars suddenly i shivered and felt
that something horrible was creeping near there was a son of deeper shade among
the shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the lamplight it slid away
at once into the dark without a sound there was no horse
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply merry started
noticing the stranger for the first time go on said frodo this is a friend
of gandalfs i will explain later
it seemed to make off up the road eastward continued merry i tried to
follow of course it vanished almost at once but i went round the corner and
on as far as the last house on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder you have a stout heart he said but
it was foolish
i dont know said merry neither brave nor silly i think i could hardly
help myself i seemed to be drawn somehow anyway i went and suddenly i heard
voices by the hedge one was muttering and the other was whispering or
hissing i couldnt hear a word that was said i did not creep any closer
because i began to tremble all over then i felt terrified and i turned back
and was just going to bolt home when something came behind me and i i fell
over
i found him sir put in nob mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern i
went down to west gate and then back up towards south gate just nigh bill
fernys house i thought i could see something in the road i couldnt swear to
it but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something lilting it i
gave a shout but where i got up to the spot there was no signs of them and
only mr brandybuck lying by the roadside he seemed to be asleep i
thought i had fallen into deep water he says to me when i shook him
very queer he was and as soon as i had roused him he got up and ran back here
like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i dont know what i said i
had an ugly dream which i cant remember i went to pieces i dont know what
came over me
i do said strider the black breath the riders must have left their
horses outside and passed back through the south gate in secret they will know
all the news now for they have visited bill ferny and probably that southerner
was a spy as well something may happen in the night before we leave bree
what will happen said merry will they attack the inn no i think
not said strider they are not all here yet and in any case that is not
their way in dark and loneliness they are strongest they will not openly
attack a house where there are lights and many people  not until they are
desperate not while all the long leagues of eriador still lie before us but
their power is in terror and already some in bree are in their clutch they
will drive these wretches to some evil work ferny and some of the strangers
and maybe the gatekeeper too they had words with harry at west gate on
monday i was watching them he was white and shaking when they left him
we seem to have enemies all round said frodo what are we to do
stay here and do not go to your rooms they are sure to have found out
which those are the hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the
ground we will all remain together and bar this window and the door but first
nob and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid account of all that had
happened since supper merry was still reading and pondering gandalfs letter
when strider and nob returned
well masters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster
down the middle of each bed and i made a nice imitation of your head with a
brown woollen mat mr bag   underhill sir he added with a grin
pippin laughed very life like he said but what will happen when they
have penetrated the disguise
we shall see said strider let us hope to hold the fort till morning
good night to you said nob and went off to take his part in the watch on
the doors
their bags and gear they piled on the parlour floor they pushed a low chair
against the door and shut the window peering out frodo saw that the night was
still clear the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of bree hill he
then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together
strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles
the hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth
but strider settled himself in the chair against the door they talked for a
little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumped over the moon chuckled merry as he rolled himself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see the worthies
of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence
i hope so said strider then they all fell silent and one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
 
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree darkness lay on buckland a
mist strayed in the dells and along the river bank the house at crickhollow
stood silent fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out a feeling
of fear had been growing on him all day and he was unable to rest or go to bed
there was a brooding threat in the breathless night air as he stared out into
the gloom a black shadow moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of its
own accord and close again without a sound terror seized him he shrank back
and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall then he shut and locked the
door
the night deepened there came the soft sound of horses led with stealth
along the lane outside the gate they stopped and three black figures entered
like shades of night creeping across the ground one went to the door one to
the corner of the house on either side and there they stood as still as the
shadows of stones while night went slowly on the house and the quiet trees
seemed to be waiting breathlessly
there was a faint stir in the leaves and a cock crowed far away the cold
hour before dawn was passing the figure by the door moved in the dark without
moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered
open in the name of mordor said a voice thin and menacing
at a second blow the door yielded and fell back with timbers burst and lock
broken the black figures passed swiftly in
at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out it rent the night
like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake
fatty bolger had not been idle as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from
the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish and run he did out of
the back door through the garden and over the fields when he reached the
nearest house more than a mile away he collapsed on the doorstep no no
no he was crying no not me i havent got it it was some time before
anyone could make out what he was babbling about at last they got the idea that
enemies were in buckland some strange invasion from the old forest and then
they lost no more time
fear fire foes
the brandybucks were blowing the horn call of buckland that had not been
sounded for a hundred years not since the white wolves came in the fell winter
when the brandywine was frozen over
awake awake
far away answering horns were heard the alarm was spreading the black
figures fled from the house one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the step as
he ran in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and gathering to a gallop
went hammering away into the darkness all about crickhollow there was the sound
of horns blowing and voices crying and feet running but the black riders rode
like a gale to the north gate let the little people blow sauron would deal
with them later meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the house
was empty and the ring had gone they rode down the guards at the gate and
vanished from the shire
in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly as if some sound or
presence had disturbed him he saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which had been tended and was burning
brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to sleep again but his dreams were again troubled with the
noise of wind and of galloping hoofs the wind seemed to be curling round the
house and shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly he opened his
eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard strider had drawn the
curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang the first grey light of day
was in the room and a cold air was coming through the open window
as soon as strider had roused them all he led the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice the windows
had been forced open and were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds
were tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor the brown
mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately went to fetch the landlord poor mr butterbur looked
sleepy and frightened he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he said but
he had never heard a sound
never has such a thing happened in my time he cried raising his hands in
horror guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters ruined and all
what are we coming to
dark times said strider but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of us we will leave at once never mind about breakfast
a drink and a bite standing will have to do we shall be packed in a few
minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready and to
fetch them a bite but very soon he came back in dismay the ponies had
vanished the stable doors had all been opened in the night and they were gone
not only merrys ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news how could they hope to reach rivendell on
foot pursued by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moon
strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits as if he was weighing up
their strength and courage
ponies would not help us to escape horsemen he said at last thoughtfully
as if he guessed what frodo had in mind we should not go much slower on foot
not on the roads that i mean to take i was going to walk in any case it is the
food and stores that trouble me we cannot count on getting anything to eat
between here and rivendell except what we take with us and we ought to take
plenty to spare for we may be delayed or forced to go round about far out of
the direct way how much are you prepared to carry on your backs
as much as we must said pippin with a sinking heart but trying to show
that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i can carry enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbur asked frodo cant we get a couple
of ponies in the village or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose we
could hire them but we might be able to buy them he added doubtfully
wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhappily the two or three riding ponies
that there were in bree were stabled in my yard and theyre gone as for other
animals horses or ponies for draught or what not there are very few of them in
bree and they wont be for sale but ill do what i can ill rout out bob and
send him round as soon as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that i am afraid we
shall have to try to get one pony at least but so ends all hope of starting
early and slipping away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce
our departure that was part of their plan no doubt
there is one crumb of comfort said merry and more than a crumb i hope
we can have breakfast while we wait   and sit down to it lets get hold of
nob
in the end there was more than three hours delay bob came back with the
report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the
neighbourhood   except one bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell a
poor old half starved creature it is said bob but he wont part with it for
less than thrice its worth seeing how youre placed not if i knows bill
ferny
bill ferny said frodo isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt
back to him with all our stuff or help in tracking us or something
i wonder said strider but i cannot imagine any animal running home to
him once it got away i fancy this is only an afterthought of kind master
fernys just a way of increasing his profits from the affair the chief danger
is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door but there does not seem any
choice what does he want for it
bill fernys price was twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at least
three times the ponys value in those pans it proved to be a bony underfed
and dispirited animal but it did not look like dying just yet mr butterbur
paid for it himself and offered merry another eighteen pence as some
compensation for the lost animals he was an honest man and well off as things
were reckoned in bree but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him and
being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bear
as a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end it turned out
later that only one horse had been actually stolen the others had been driven
off or had bolted in terror and were found wandering in different corners of
the bree land merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a
good deal of sense they made their way to the downs in search of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for a while and were well off but
when news of the events at bree came to toms ears he sent them to mr
butterbur who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price they had to work
harder in bree but bob treated them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey but they never came to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his money was gone for
good or for bad and he had other troubles for there was a great commotion as
soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn
the southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly
until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the
night none other than bill fernys squint eyed companion suspicion fell on him
at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him to my house said
butterbur angrily you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come
shouting at me go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is but it appeared
that he was nobodys friend and nobody could recollect when he had joined their
party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get together further
supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting it was close on ten
oclock before they at last got off by that time the whole of bree was buzzing
with excitement frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the black horsemen
the robbing of the stables and not least the news that strider the ranger had
joined the mysterious hobbits made such a tale as would last for many
uneventful years most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many even
from combe and archet were crowded in the road to see the travellers start the
other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows
strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse
half the inhabitants would follow them to see what they were up to and to
prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave of mr butterbur with many
thanks i hope we shall meet again some day when things are merry once more
said frodo i should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace
for a while
they tramped off anxious and downhearted under the eyes of the crowd not
all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted but strider
seemed to be held in awe by most of the bree landers and those that he stared
at shut their mouths and drew away he walked in front with frodo next came
merry and pippin and last came sam leading the pony which was laden with as
much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it looked
less dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes sam was chewing
an apple thoughtfully he had a pocket full of them a parting present from nob
and bob apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said but i reckon
ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors
or popped over walls and fences as they passed but as they drew near to the
further gate frodo saw a dark ill kept house behind a thick hedge the last
house in the village in one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face
with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that southerner is hiding he thought he looks more than
half like a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly he had heavy black brows and
dark scornful eyes his large mouth curled in a sneer he was smoking a short
black pipe as they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat
morning longshanks he said off early found some friends at last
strider nodded but did not answer morning my little friends he said to the
others i suppose you know who youve taken up with thats stick at naught
strider that is though ive heard other names not so pretty watch out
tonight and you sammie dont go ill treating my poor old pony pah he spat
again
sam turned quickly and you ferny he said put your ugly face out of
sight or it will get hurt with a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square on the nose he ducked too late and curses
came from behind the hedge waste of a good apple said sam regretfully and
strode on
at last they left the village behind the escort of children and stragglers
that had followed them got tired and turned back at the south gate passing
through they kept on along the road for some miles it bent to the left
curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and
then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country to their left they
could see some of the houses and hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler
south eastern slopes of the hill down in a deep hollow away north of the road
there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where combe lay
archet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had left bree hill standing tall
and brown behind they came on a narrow track that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open and take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope said pippin our last short cut
through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider my cuts short
or long dont go wrong he took a look up and down the road no one was in
sight and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley
his plan as far as they could understand it without knowing the country was
to go towards archet at first but to bear right and pass it on the east and
then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to weathertop hill in
that way they would if all went well cut off a great loop of the road which
further on bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshes but of course they
would have to pass through the marshes themselves and striders description of
them was not encouraging
however in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant indeed if it had not
been for the disturbing events of the night before they would have enjoyed this
pan of the journey better than any up to that time the sun was shining clear
but not too hot the woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour
and seemed peaceful and wholesome strider guided them confidently among the
many crossing paths although left to themselves they would soon have been at a
loss he was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings to put off
any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left the road for certain he said
though i dont think he will follow us himself he knows the land round here
well enough but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood it is what he may
tell others that i am afraid of i dont suppose they are far away if they
think we have made for archet so much the better
whether because of striders skill or for some other reason they saw no sign
and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day neither two footed
except birds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels the next day
they began to steer a steady course eastwards and still all was quiet and
peaceful on the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwood the land
had been falling steadily ever since they turned aside from the road and they
now entered a wide flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage they
were far beyond the borders of the bree land out in the pathless wilderness
and drawing near to the midge water marshes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy and here and there they came
upon pools and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of
little hidden birds they had to pick their way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their proper course at first they made fan progress but as
they went on their passage became slower and more dangerous the marshes were
bewildering and treacherous and there was no permanent trail even for rangers
to find through their shifting quagmires the flies began to torment them and
the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and
breeches and into their hair
i am being eaten alive cried pippin midgewater there are more midges
than water
what do they live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam scratching his
neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country their
camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting insects would
not let them sleep there were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and
tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket there
were thousands of them and they squeaked all round neek breek breek neek
unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frantic
the next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as
comfortless though the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
behind the midges still pursued them
as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes it seemed to him that far
away there came a light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times it
was not the dawn for that was still some hours off
 what is the light he said to strider who had risen and was standing
gazing ahead into the night
i do not know strider answered it is too distant to make out it is like
lightning that leaps up from the hill tops
frodo lay down again but for a long while he could still see the white
flashes and against them the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and
watchful at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling
pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them the land before them began
steadily to rise again away in the distance eastward they could now see a line
of hills the highest of them was at the right of the line and a little
separated from the others it had a conical top slightly flattened at the
summit
that is weathertop said strider the old road which we have left far
away on our right runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot we
might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it i suppose we had
better do so
what do you mean asked frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not certain what we shall find it is
close to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there
yes but the hope is faint if he comes this way at all he may not pass
through bree and so he may not know what we are doing and anyway unless by
luck we arrive almost together we shall miss one another it will not be safe
for him or for us to wait there long if the riders fail to find us in the
wilderness they are likely to make for weathertop themselves it commands a
wide view all round indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand here from that hill top not all the birds are
to be trusted and there are other spies more evil than they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills sam looked up into the
pale sky fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright
unfriendly eyes you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome strider he
said
what do you advise us to do asked frodo
i think answered strider slowly as if he was not quite sure i think the
best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can to make for the
line of hills not for weathertop there we can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from the north and less openly
then we shall see what we shall see
all that day they plodded along until the cold and early evening came down
the land became drier and more barren but mists and vapours lay behind them on
the marshes a few melancholy birds were piping and wailing until the round red
sun sank slowly into the western shadows then an empty silence fell the
hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful
windows of bag end far away
at the days end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to
lose itself in the stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while
the light lasted it was already night when at last they halted and made their
camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores of the stream ahead there
loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills that
night they set a watch and strider it seemed did not sleep at all the moon
was waxing and in the early night hours a cold grey light lay on the land
next morning they set out again soon after sunrise there was a frost in the
air and the sky was a pale clear blue the hobbits felt refreshed as if they
had had a night of unbroken sleep already they were getting used to much
walking on short commons   shorter at any rate than what in the shire they would
have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs pippin declared that
frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frodo tightening his belt considering that there is
actually a good deal less of me i hope the thinning process will not go on
indefinitely or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such things said strider quickly and with surprising
earnestness
the hills drew nearer they made an undulating ridge often rising almost to
a thousand feet and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes
leading into the eastern land beyond along the crest of the ridge the hobbits
could see what looked to be the remains of green grown walls and dikes and in
the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone by night they had
reached the feet of the westward slopes and there they camped it was the night
of the fifth of october and they were six days out from bree
in the morning they found for the first time since they had left the
chetwood a track plain to see they turned right and followed it southwards it
ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as
possible from the view both of the hill tops above and of the flats to the
west it dived into dells and hugged steep banks and where it passed over
flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large
boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what for said merry as they walked along
one of these avenues where the stones were unusually large and closely set i
am not sure that i like it it has a   well rather a barrow wightish look is
there any barrow on weathertop
no there is no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answered
strider the men of the west did not live here though in their latter days
they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of angmar
this path was made to serve the forts along the walls but long before in the
first days of the north kingdom they built a great watch tower on weathertop
amon sûl they called it it was burned and broken and nothing remains of
it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head yet once
it was tall and fair it is told that elendil stood there watching for the
coming of gil galad out of the west in the days of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider it seemed that he was learned in old lore as
well as in the ways of the wild who was gil galad asked merry but strider
did not answer and seemed to be lost in thought suddenly a low voice murmured
gil galad was an elven king

of him the harpers sadly sing

the last whose realm was fair and free

between the mountains and the sea



his sword was long his lance was keen

his shining helm afar was seen

the countless stars of heavens field

were mirrored in his silver shield



but long ago he rode away

and where he dwelleth none can say

for into darkness fell his star

in mordor where the shadows are
the others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
dont stop said merry
thats all i know stammered sam blushing i learned it from mr bilbo
when i was a lad he used to tell me tales like that knowing how i was always
one for hearing about elves it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters he was
mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo and he wrote poetry he wrote
what i have just said
he did not make it up said strider it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue bilbo must have translated
it i never knew that
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor i didnt learn that
part it gave me the shivers i never thought i should be going that way myself
going to mordor cried pippin i hope it wont come to that
do not speak that name so loudly said strider
it was already mid day when they drew near the southern end of the path and
saw before them in the pale clear light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill they decided to
make for the top at once while the daylight was broad concealment was no longer
possible and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them
nothing was to be seen moving on the hill if gandalf was anywhere about there
was no sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered hollow at the
bottom of which there was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides there they left
sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage the other three went
on after half an hours plodding climb strider reached the crown of the hill
frodo and merry followed tired and breathless the last slope had been steep
and rocky
on the top they found as strider had said a wide ring of ancient stonework
now crumbling or covered with age long grass but in the centre a cairn of
broken stones had been piled they were blackened as if with fire about them
the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched
and shrivelled as if flames had swept the hill top but there was no sign of
any living thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw all round below them a
wide prospect for the most pan of lands empty and featureless except for
patches of woodland away to the south beyond which they caught here and there
the glint of distant water beneath them on this southern side there ran like a
ribbon the old road coming out of the west and winding up and down until it
faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east nothing was moving on it
following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the mountains the nearer
foothills were brown and sombre behind them stood taller shapes of grey and
behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds
well here we are said merry and very cheerless and uninviting it looks
there is no water and no shelter and no sign of gandalf but i dont blame him
for not waiting   if he ever came here
i wonder said strider looking round thoughtfully even if he was a day
or two behind us at bree he could have arrived here first he can ride very
swiftly when need presses suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the
top of the cairn it was flatter than the others and whiter as if it had
escaped the fire he picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled recently he said what do you think of these
marks
on the flat under side frodo saw some scratches 
there seems to he a stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left might be a g rune with thin branches said strider
it might be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure the scratches
are fine and they certainly look fresh but the marks might mean something
quite different and have nothing to do with us rangers use runes and they
come here sometimes
what could they mean even if gandalf made them asked merry
i should say answered strider that they stood for g3 and were a sign
that gandalf was here on october the third that is three days ago now it would
also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand so that he had no time
or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer if that is so we must be
wary
i wish we could feel sure that he made the marks whatever they may mean
said frodo it would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way in front
of us or behind us
perhaps said strider for myself i believe that he was here and was in
danger there have been scorching flames here and now the light that we saw
three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind i guess that he was
attacked on this hill top but with what result i cannot tell he is here no
longer and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell
as best we can 
how far is rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily the world looked
wild and wide from weathertop
i dont know if the road has ever been measured in miles beyond the forsaken
inn a days journey east of bree answered strider some say it is so
far and some say otherwise it is a strange road and folk are glad to reach
their journeys end whether the time is long or short but i know how long it
would take me on my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days
from here to the ford of bruinen where the road crosses the loudwater that runs
out of rivendell we have at least a fortnights journey before us for i do not
think we shall be able to use the road
a fortnight said frodo a lot may happen in that time
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edge in
that lonely place frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and
danger he wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and
beloved shire he stared down at the hateful road leading back westward   to
his home suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along
it going westward and looking again he saw that three others were creeping
eastward to meet them he gave a cry and clutched striders arm
look he said pointing downwards
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle pulling
frodo down beside him merry threw himself alongside
what is it he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worst answered strider
slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again and peered through a
cleft between two jagged stones the light was no longer bright for the clear
morning had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had now overtaken the
sun as it began to go down they could all see the black specks but neither
frodo nor merry could make out their shapes for certain yet something told them
that there far below were black riders assembling on the road beyond the foot
of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt the enemy is
here
hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find
their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idle they had explored the small dell and the
surrounding slopes not far away they found a spring of clear water in the
hillside and near it footprints not more than a day or two old in the dell
itself they found recent traces of a fire and other signs of a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill behind
them sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin whoever it was
put this stuff here meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly interested in these discoveries i wish i had waited and
explored the ground down here myself he said hurrying off to the spring to
examine the footprints
it is just as i feared he said when he came back sam and pippin have
trampled the soft ground and the marks are spoilt or confused rangers have
been here lately it is they who left the firewood behind but there are also
several newer tracks that were not made by rangers at least one set was made
only a day or two ago by heavy boots at least one i cannot now be certain
but i think there were many booted feet he paused and stood in anxious
thought
each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted
riders if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner strider led them
somewhere else the better sam viewed the hollow with great dislike now that he
had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hadnt we better clear out quick mr strider he asked impatiently it is
getting late and i dont like this hole it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at once answered strider looking
up and considering the time and the weather well sam he said at last i do
not like this place either but i cannot think of anywhere better that we could
reach before nightfall at least we are out of sight for the moment and if we
moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies all we could do would
be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills
where the land is all much the same as it is here the road is watched but we
should have to cross it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the
south on the north side of the road beyond the hills the country is bare and
flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry i mean they seem usually to have
used their noses rather than their eyes smelling for us if smelling is the
right word at least in the daylight but you made us lie down flat when you saw
them down below and now you talk of being seen if we move
i was too careless on the hill top answered strider i was very anxious
to find some sign of gandalf but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and
stand there so long for the black horses can see and the riders can use men
and other creatures as spies as we found at bree they themselves do not see
the world of light as we do but our shapes cast shadows in their minds which
only the noon sun destroys and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms
that are hidden from us then they are most to be feared and at all times they
smell the blood of living things desiring and hating it senses too there are
other than sight or smell we can feel their presence   it troubled our hearts
as soon as we came here and before we saw them they feel ours more keenly
also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring draws them
is there no escape then said frodo looking round wildly if i move i
shall be seen and hunted if i stay i shall draw them to me
strider laid his hand on his shoulder there is still hope he said you
are not alone let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign
there is little shelter or defence here but fire shall serve for both sauron
can put fire to his evil uses as he can all things but these riders do not
love it and fear those who wield it fire is our friend in the wilderness
maybe muttered sam it is also as good a way of saying here we
are as i can think of bar shouting
down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire and
prepared a meal the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold they
were suddenly aware of great hunger for they had not eaten anything since
breakfast but they dared not make more than a frugal supper the lands ahead
were empty of all save birds and beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the
races of the world rangers passed at times beyond the hills but they were few
and did not stay other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the misty mountains only on
the road would travellers be found most often dwarves hurrying along on
business of their own and with no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how our food can be made to last said frodo we have been
careful enough in the last few days and this supper is no feast but we have
used more than we ought if we have two weeks still to go and perhaps more
there is food in the wild said strider berry root and herb and i have
some skill as a hunter at need you need not be afraid of starving before winter
comes but gathering and catching food is long and weary work and we need
haste so tighten your belts and think with hope of the tables of elronds
house
the cold increased as darkness came on peering out from the edge of the dell
they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow the
sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars frodo
and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in every garment and blanket
they possessed but strider was content with a single cloak and sat a little
apart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began
to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear he knew many histories and
legends of long ago of elves and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder
days they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of gil galad said merry suddenly when he paused at the end of a
story of the elf kingdoms do you know any more of that old lay that you spoke
of
i do indeed answered strider so also does frodo for it concerns us
closely merry and pippin looked at frodo who was staring into the fire
i know only the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad was the last of the great elf kings of middle earth gil galad is starlight
in their tongue with elendil the elf friend he went to the land of   
no said strider interrupting i do not think that tale should be told now
with the servants of the enemy at hand if we win through to the house of
elrond you may hear it there told in full
then tell us some other tale of the old days begged sam a tale about the
elves before the fading time i would dearly like to hear more about elves the
dark seems to press round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinúviel said strider in brief   for
it is a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now except
elrond that remember it aright as it was told of old it is a fair tale though
it is sad as are all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your
hearts he was silent for some time and then he began not to speak but to
chant softly
the leaves were long the grass was green

the hemlock umbels tall and fair

and in the glade a light was seen

of stars in shadow shimmering

tinúviel was dancing there

to music of a pipe unseen

and light of stars was in her hair

and in her raiment glimmering



there beren came from mountains cold

and lost he wandered under leaves

and where the elven river rolled

he walked alone and sorrowing

he peered between the hemlock leaves

and saw in wander flowers of gold

upon her mantle and her sleeves

and her hair like shadow following



enchantment healed his weary feet

that over hills were doomed to roam

and forth he hastened strong and fleet

and grasped at moonbeams glistening

through woven woods in elvenhome

she tightly fled on dancing feet

and left him lonely still to roam

in the silent forest listening



he heard there oft the flying sound

of feet as light as linden leaves

or music welling underground

in hidden hollows quavering

now withered lay the hemlock sheaves

and one by one with sighing sound

whispering fell the beechen leaves

in the wintry woodland wavering



he sought her ever wandering far

where leaves of years were thickly strewn

by light of moon and ray of star

in frosty heavens shivering

her mantle glinted in the moon

as on a hill top high and far

she danced and at her feet was strewn

a mist of silver quivering



when winter passed she came again

and her song released the sudden spring

like rising lark and falling rain

and melting water bubbling

he saw the elven flowers spring

about her feet and healed again

he longed by her to dance and sing

upon the grass untroubling



again she fled but swift he came

tinúviel tinúviel

he called her by her elvish name

and there she halted listening

one moment stood she and a spell

his voice laid on her beren came

and doom fell on tinúviel

that in his arms lay glistening



as beren looked into her eyes

within the shadows of her hair

the trembling starlight of the skies

he saw there mirrored shimmering

tinúviel the elven fair

immortal maiden elven wise

about him cast her shadowy hair

and arms like silver glimmering



long was the way that fate them bore

oer stony mountains cold and grey

through halls of iron and darkling door

and woods of nightshade morrowless

the sundering seas between them lay

and yet at last they met once more

and long ago they passed away

in the forest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and paused before he spoke again  that is a song he said
in the mode that is called ann thennath among the elves but is hard to
render in our common speech and this is but a rough echo of it it tells of the
meeting of beren son of barahir and lúthien tinúviel beren was a
mortal man but lúthien was the daughter of thingol a king of elves upon
middle earth when the world was young and she was the fairest maiden that has
ever been among all the children of this world as the stars above the mists of
the northern lands was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light in
those days the great enemy of whom sauron of mordor was but a servant dwelt in
angband in the north and the elves of the west coming back to middle earth made
war upon him to regain the silmarils which he had stolen and the fathers of men
aided the elves but the enemy was victorious and barahir was slain and beren
escaping through great peril came over the mountains of terror into the hidden
kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth there he beheld lúthien
singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river esgalduin and he
named her tinúviel that is nightingale in the language of old many
sorrows befell them afterwards and they were parted long tinúviel
rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and together they passed through
great dangers and cast down even the great enemy from his throne and took from
his iron crown one of the three silmarils brightest of all jewels to be the
bride price of lúthien to thingol her father yet at the last beren was
slain by the wolf that came from the gates of angband and he died in the arms
of tinúviel but she chose mortality and to die from the world so that
she might follow him and it is sung that they met again beyond the sundering
seas and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods
together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world so it is that
lúthien tinúviel alone of the elf kindred has died indeed and left
the world and they have lost her whom they most loved but from her the lineage
of the elf lords of old descended among men there live still those of whom lúthien
was the foremother and it is said that her line shall never fail elrond of
rivendell is of that kin for of beren and lúthien was born dior
thingols heir and of him elwing the white whom eärendil wedded he that
sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the
silmaril upon his brow and of eärendil came the kings of númenor
that is westernesse
as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face dimly lit in the
red glow of the wood fire his eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep
above him was a black starry sky suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown
of weathertop behind him the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill
that overshadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the story ended the hobbits moved and stretched look said merry the
moon is rising it must be getting late
the others looked up even as they did so they saw on the top of the hill
something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise it was perhaps
only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light
sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire frodo and pippin remained
seated in silence strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently all
seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart now
that strider was no longer speaking he huddled closer to the fire at that
moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell
i dont know what it is he said but i suddenly felt afraid i durstnt
go outside this dell for any money i felt that something was creeping up the
slope
did you see anything asked frodo springing to his feet
no sir i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look
i saw something said merry or i thought i did   away westwards where the
moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thought
there were two or three black shapes they seemed to be moving this way
keep close to the fire with your faces outward cried strider get some
of the longer sticks ready in your hands
for a breathless time they sat there silent and alert with their backs
turned to the wood fire each gazing into the shadows that encircled them
nothing happened there was no sound or movement in the night frodo stirred
feeling that he must break the silence he longed to shout out aloud
hush whispered strider whats that gasped pippin at the same moment
over the lip of the little dell on the side away from the hill they felt
rather than saw a shadow rise one shadow or more than one they strained their
eyes and the shadows seemed to grow soon there could be no doubt
three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope looking
down on them so black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep
shade behind them frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous
breath and felt a thin piercing chill then the shapes slowly advanced
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the
ground sam shrank to frodos side frodo was hardly less terrified than his
companions he was quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror was
swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring the desire to do this
laid hold of him and he could think of nothing else he did not forget the
barrow nor the message of gandalf but something seemed to be compelling him to
disregard all warnings and he longed to yield not with the hope of escape or
of doing anything either good or bad he simply felt that he must take the ring
and put it on his finger he could not speak he felt sam looking at him as if
he knew that his master was in some great trouble but he could not turn towards
him he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but resistance became
unbearable and at last he slowly drew out the chain and slipped the ring on
the forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark the
shapes became terribly clear he was able to see beneath their black wrappings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip of the dell three
advancing in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under their
mantles were long grey robes upon their grey hairs were helms of silver in
their haggard hands were swords of steel their eyes fell on him and pierced
him as they rushed towards him desperate he drew his own sword and it seemed
to him that it flickered red as if it was a firebrand two of the figures
halted the third was taller than the others his hair was long and gleaming and
on his helm was a crown in one hand he held a long sword and in the other a
knife both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light he
sprang forward and bore down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground and he heard
himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at the same time he struck
at the feet of his enemy a shrill cry rang out in the night and he felt a pain
like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder even as he swooned he
caught as through a swirling mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the
darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand with a last effort frodo
dropping his sword slipped the ring from his finger and closed his right hand
tight upon it
 
when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperately he
was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightly his three
companions were bending over him what has happened where is the pale king
he asked wildly they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a
while nor did they understand his question at length he gathered from sam that
they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them suddenly
to his horror sam found that his master had vanished and at that moment a black
shadow rushed past him and he fell he heard frodos voice but it seemed to
come from a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange words
they saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body of frodo lying as if
dead face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him strider ordered
them to pick him up and lay him near the fire and then he disappeared that was
now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider but while they
were talking he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadows they started
and sam drew his sword and stood over frodo but strider knelt down swiftly at
his side
i am not a black rider sam he said gently nor in league with them i
have been trying to discover something of their movements but i have found
nothing i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again but there is
no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tell he became full of concern and shook
his head and sighed then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much water as
they could in their small kettles and to bathe the wound with it keep the
fire going well and keep frodo warm he said then he got up and walked away
and called sam to him i think i understand things better now he said in a
low voice there seem only to have been five of the enemy why they were not
all here i dont know but i dont think they expected to be resisted they
have drawn off for the time being but not far i fear they will come again
another night if we cannot escape they are only waiting because they think
that their purpose is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much
further i fear sam that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will
subdue him to their will we shall see sam choked with tears dont despair
said strider you must trust me now your frodo is made of sterner stuff than i
had guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so he is not slain and
i think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies
expect i will do all i can to help and heal him guard him well while i am
away he hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of his wound was slowly growing and a deadly
chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side his friends watched
over him warming him and bathing his wound the night passed slowly and
wearily dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was filling with grey light
when strider at last returned
look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that
had lain there hidden by the darkness a foot above the lower hem there was a
slash this was the stroke of frodos sword he said the only hurt that it
did to his enemy i fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pierce
that dreadful king more deadly to him was the name of elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped again and lifted up a long
thin knife there was a cold gleam in it as strider raised it they saw that
near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off but even as he
held it up in the growing light they gazed in astonishment for the blade
seemed to melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving only the hilt in
striders hand alas he cried it was this accursed knife that gave the
wound few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons but i will
do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the dagger hilt laid it on his knees
and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue then setting it aside he
turned to frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch from
the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to find for this plant does not
grow in the bare hills but in the thickets away south of the road i found it in
the dark by the scent of its leaves he crushed a leaf in his fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance it is fortunate that i could find it
for it is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth athelas
they named it and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt
or camped of old and it is not known in the north except to some of those who
wander in the wild it has great virtues but over such a wound as this its
healing powers may be small
he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos shoulder the
fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that were unhurt felt their
minds calmed and cleared the herb had also some power over the wound for frodo
felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side but the life
did not return to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand he bitterly
regretted his foolishness and reproached himself for weakness of will for he
now perceived that in putting on the ring he obeyed not his own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies he wondered if he would remain maimed for life
and how they would now manage to continue their journey he fell too weak to
stand
the others were discussing this very question they quickly decided to leave
weathertop as soon as possible i think now said strider that the enemy has
been watching this place for some days if gandalf ever came here then he must
have been forced to ride away and he will not return in any case we are in
great peril here after dark since the attack of last night and we can hardly
meet greater danger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight was full they had some hurried food and packed it
was impossible for frodo to walk so they divided the greater part of their
baggage among the four of them and put frodo on the pony in the last few days
the poor beast had improved wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger
and had begun to show an affection for its new masters especially for sam bill
fernys treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem
so much better than its former life
they started off in a southerly direction this would mean crossing the road
but it was the quickest way to more wooded country and they needed fuel for
strider said that frodo must be kept warm especially at night while fire would
be some protection for them all it was also his plan to shorten their journey
by cutting across another great loop of the road east beyond weathertop it
changed its course and took a wide bend northwards
they made their way slowly and cautiously round the south western slopes of
the hill and came in a little while to the edge of the road there was no sign
of the riders but even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two
cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering trembling they sprang
forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead the land before them sloped
away southwards but it was wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in
dense patches with wide barren spaces in between the grass was scanty coarse
and grey and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling it was a
cheerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy they spoke little as they
trudged along frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him
with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens even strider
seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the first days march was over frodos pain began to grow again but
he did not speak of it for a long time four days passed without the ground or
the scene changing much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and
before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer yet since that far cry
they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or
followed them they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs by night
expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night dimly lit
by the cloud veiled moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but the sigh
of withered leaves and grass not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell it seemed too much to hope
that the riders had already lost their trail again perhaps they were waiting to
make some ambush in a narrow place
at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of
the wide shallow valley into which they had descended strider now turned their
course again north eastwards and on the sixth day they reached the top of a
long slow climbing slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills away below
them they could see the road sweeping round the feet of the hills and to their
right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine in the distance they
glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to the road here for a while said
strider we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elves call
mitheithel it flows down out of the ettenmoors the troll fells north of
rivendell and joins the loudwater away in the south some call it the greyflood
after that it is a great water before it finds the sea there is no way over it
below its sources in the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which the road
crosses
what is that other river we can see far away there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider the road
runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to the ford of
bruinen but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water one river at
a time we shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the last bridge held
against us
next day early in the morning they came down again to the borders of the
road sam and strider went forward but they found no sign of any travellers or
riders here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain strider
judged that it had fallen two days before and had washed away all footprints
no horseman had passed since then as far as he could see
they hurried along with all the speed they could make and after a mile or
two they saw the last bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope they
dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none strider made them
take cover in a thicket at the side of the road while he went forward to
explore
before long he came hurrying back i can see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that means but i have found something very
strange
he held out his hand and showed a single pale green jewel i found it in
the mud in the middle of the bridge he said it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or let fall by chance i cannot say but it brings
hope to me i will take it as a sign that we may pass the bridge but beyond
that i dare not keep to the road without some clearer token
at once they went on again they crossed the bridge in safety hearing no
sound but the water swirling against its three great arches a mile further on
they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on
the left of the road here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in a
sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous road
behind them but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly as they
went forward the hills about them steadily rose here and there upon heights and
ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and
to think he recalled bilbos account of his journey and the threatening towers
on the hills north of the road in the country near the trolls wood where his
first serious adventure had happened frodo guessed that they were now in the
same region and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who lives in this land he asked and who built these towers is this
troll country
no said strider trolls do not build no one lives in this land men once
dwelt here ages ago but none remain now they became an evil people as
legends tell for they fell under the shadow of angmar but all were destroyed
in the war that brought the north kingdom to its end but that is now so long
ago that the hills have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the land is empty and forgetful
asked peregrin the birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son
the heirs of elendil do not forget all things past said strider and many
more things than i can tell are remembered in rivendell have you often been
to rivendell said frodo i have said strider i dwelt there once and
still i return when i may
there my heart is but it is not my fate to sit in peace even in the fair
house of elrond
the hills now began to shut them in the road behind held on its way to the
river bruinen but both were now hidden from view the travellers came into a
long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent trees with old and twisted
roots hung over cliffs and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary they advanced slowly for they had to pick their
way through a pathless country encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks as
long as they could they avoided climbing for frodos sake and because it was in
fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales they had been two
days in this country when the weather turned wet the wind began to blow
steadily out of the west and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark
heads of the hills in fine drenching rain by nightfall they were all soaked
and their camp was cheerless for they could not get any fire to burn the next
day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them and they were forced to
turn away northwards out of their course strider seemed to be getting anxious
they were nearly ten days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions was
beginning to run low it went on raining
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock wall behind them in
which there was a shallow cave a mere scoop in the cliff frodo was restless
the cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever and the ache and
sense of deadly chill took away all sleep he lay tossing and turning and
listening fearfully to the stealthy night noises wind in chinks of rock water
dripping a crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone he felt that
black shapes were advancing to smother him but when he sat up he saw nothing
but the back of strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching he
lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream in which he walked on the grass
in his garden in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less clear than the
tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped the clouds were
still thick but they were breaking and pale strips of blue appeared between
them the wind was shifting again they did not start early immediately after
their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off alone telling the others
to remain under the shelter of the cliff until he came back he was going to
climb up if he could and get a look at the lie of the land
when he returned he was not reassuring we have come too far to the north
he said and we must find some way to turn back southwards again if we keep on
as we are going we shall get up into the ettendales far north of rivendell that
is troll country and little known to me we could perhaps find our way through
and come round to rivendell from the north but it would take too long for i do
not know the way and our food would not last so somehow or other we must find
the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground they found a
passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south east the
direction that they wished to take but towards the end of the day they found
their road again barred by a ridge of high land its dark edge against the sky
was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw they had a choice
between going back or climbing over it
they decided to attempt the climb but it proved very difficult before long
frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot even so they often
despaired of getting their pony up or indeed of finding a path for themselves
burdened as they were the light was nearly gone and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached the top they had climbed on to a narrow saddle
between two higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short
distance ahead frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering his
left arm was lifeless and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid
upon them the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go any further said merry to strider i am afraid this has been
too much for frodo i am dreadfully anxious about him what are we to do do you
think they will be able to cure him in rivendell if we ever get there
we shall see answered strider there is nothing more that i can do in the
wilderness and it is chiefly because of his wound that i am so anxious to press
on but i agree that we can go no further tonight
what is the matter with my master asked sam in a low voice looking
appealingly at strider his wound was small and it is already closed theres
nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been touched by the weapons of the enemy said strider and
there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out but
do not give up hope sam
night was cold up on the high ridge they lit a small fire down under the
gnarled roots of an old pine that hung over a shallow pit it looked as if
stone had once been quarried there they sat huddled together the wind blew
chill through the pass and they heard the tree tops lower down moaning and
sighing frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endless dark wings were
sweeping by above him and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in
all the hollows of the hills
the morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean and the light pale and
clear in a rain washed sky their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for
the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs as soon as it was light strider took
merry with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the
pass the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more
comforting news they were now going more or less in the right direction if
they went on down the further side of the ridge they would have the mountains
on their left some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the loudwater
again and he knew that though it was hidden from view the road to the ford
was not far from the river and lay on the side nearest to them
we must make for the road again he said we cannot hope to find a path
through these hills whatever danger may beset it the road is our only way to
the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again they climbed slowly down the
southern side of the ridge but the way was much easier than they had expected
for the slope was far less steep on this side and before long frodo was able to
ride again bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for
picking out a path and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible the
spirits of the party rose again even frodo felt better in the morning light
but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight and he passed his
hands over his eyes
pippin was a little ahead of the others suddenly he turned round and called
to them there is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that he had made no mistake
there were clearly the beginnings of a path that climbed with many windings
out of the woods below and faded away on the hill top behind in places it was
now faint and overgrown or choked with fallen stones and trees but at one time
it seemed to have been much used it was a path made by strong arms and heavy
feet here and there old trees had been cut or broken down and large rocks
cloven or heaved aside to make a way
they followed the track for some while for it offered much the easiest way
down but they went cautiously and their anxiety increased as they came into
the dark woods and the path grew plainer and broader suddenly coming out of a
belt of fir trees it ran steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left
round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill when they came to the comer
they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face
of a low cliff overhung with trees in the stony wall there was a door hanging
crookedly ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted there was a cave or rock chamber behind
but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen strider sam and merry pushing
with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider and then
strider and merry went in they did not go far for on the floor lay many old
bones and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty
jars and broken pots
surely this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pippin come out
you two and let us get away now we know who made the path  and we had better
get off it quick
there is no need i think said strider coining out it is certainly a
troll hole but it seems to have been long forsaken i dont think we need be
afraid but let us go on down warily and we shall see
the path went on again from the door and turning to the right again across
the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope pippin not liking to show
strider that he was still afraid went on ahead with merry sam and strider came
behind one on each side of frodos pony for the path was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to walk abreast but they had not gone very far before
pippin came running back followed by merry they both looked terrified
there are trolls pippin panted down in a clearing in the woods
not far below we got a sight of them through the tree trunks they are very
large
we will come and look at them said strider picking up a stick frodo said
nothing but sam looked scared
the sun was now high and it shone down through the half stripped branches of
the trees and lit the clearing with bright patches of light they halted
suddenly on the edge and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
there stood the trolls three large trolls one was stooping and the other two
stood staring at him
strider walked forward unconcernedly get up old stone he said and broke
his stick upon the stooping troll
nothing happened there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then
even frodo laughed well he said we are forgetting our family history
these must be the very three that were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere near the place said pippin he knew the
story well bilbo and frodo had told it often but as a matter of fact he had
never more than half believed it even now he looked at the stone trolls with
suspicion wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again
you are forgetting not only your family history but all you ever knew about
trolls said strider it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet you come
back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade
in any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old birds nest
behind his ear that would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll
they all laughed frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos
first successful adventure was heartening the sun too was warm and
comforting and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little they
rested for some time in the glade and took their mid day meal right under the
shadow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song while the sun is high said merry
when they had finished we havent had a song or a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo the others looked at him dont worry
about me he added i feel much better but i dont think i could sing
perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory
come on sam said merry theres more stored in your head than you let on
about
i dont know about that said sam but how would this suit it aint what
i call proper poetry if you understand me just a bit of nonsense but these
old images here brought it to my mind standing up with his hands behind his
back as if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone

and munched and mumbled a bare old bone

for many a year he had gnawed it near

for meat was hard to come by

done by gum by

in a case in the hills he dwelt alone

and meat was hard to come by



up came tom with his big boots on

said he to troll pray what is yon

for it looks like the shin o my nuncle tim

as should be a lyin in graveyard

caveyard paveyard

this many a year has tim been gone

and i thought he were lyin in graveyard



my lad said troll this bone i stole

but what be bones that lie in a hole

thy nuncle was dead as a lump o lead

afore i found his shinbone

tinbone thinbone

he can spare a share for a poor old troll

for he dont need his shinbone



said tom i dont see why the likes o thee

without axin leave should go makin free

with the shank or the shin o my fathers kin

so hand the old bone over

rover trover

though dead he be it belongs to he

so hand the old bone over



for a couple o pins says troll and grins

ill eat thee too and gnaw thy shins

a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet

ill try my teeth on thee now

hee now see now

im tired o gnawing old bones and skins

ive a mind to dine on thee now



but just as he thought his dinner was caught

he found his hands had hold of naught

before he could mind tom slipped behind

and gave him the boot to larn him

warn him darn him

a bump o the boot on the seat tom thought

would be the way to larn him



but harder than stone is the flesh and bone

of a troll that sits in the hills alone

as well set your boot to the mountains root

for the seat of a troll dont feel it

peel it heal it

old troll laughed when he heard tom groan

and he knew his toes could feel it



toms leg is game since home he came

and his bootless foot is lasting lame

but troll dont care and hes still there

with the bone he boned from its owner

doner boner

trolls old seat is still the same

and the bone he boned from its owner
well thats a warning to us all laughed merry it is as well you used a
stick and not your hand strider
 where did you come by that sam asked pippin ive never heard those
words before
sam muttered something inaudible its out of his own head of course said
frodo i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on this journey first he was a
conspirator now hes a jester hell end up by becoming a wizard   or a
warrior
i hope not said sam i dont want to be neither
in the afternoon they went on down the woods they were probably following
the very track that gandalf bilbo and the dwarves had used many years before
after a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the road at
this point the road had left the hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley and
now clung close to the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather covered slopes towards the ford and the mountains not far
down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grass on it roughly cut and
now much weathered could still be seen dwarf runes and secret marks
there said merry that must be the stone that marked the place where the
trolls gold was hidden how much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at the stone and wished that bilbo had brought home no treasure
more perilous nor less easy to pan with none at all he said bilbo gave it
all away he told me he did not feel it was really his as it came from
robbers
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening there was no sign
of any other travellers to be seen as there was now no other possible course
for them to take they climbed down the bank and turning left went off as fast
as they could soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast
westering sun a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
they were beginning to look out for a place off the road where they could
camp for the night when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
their hearts the noise of hoofs behind them they looked back but they could
not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the road as quickly as
they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and
bilberry brushwood on the slopes above until they came to a small patch of
thick growing hazels as they peered out from among the bushes they could see
the road faint and grey in the failing light some thirty feel below them the
sound of hoofs drew nearer they were going fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blown away from them by the breeze they seemed to
catch a dim ringing as of small bells tinkling
that does not sound like a black riders horse said frodo listening
intently the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but they all
remained full of suspicion they had been in fear of pursuit for so long that
any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly but strider was now leaning
forward stooped to the ground with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his
face
the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly clearer and
nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting
feet suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows
running swiftly in the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed as if it were
studded with gems like living stars the riders cloak streamed behind him and
his hood was thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his
speed to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and
raiment of the rider as if through a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road leaping with a
cry through the heather but even before he had moved or called the rider had
reined in his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out ai na
vedui dúnadan mae govannen his speech and clear ringing voice left
no doubt in their hearts the rider was of the elven folk no others that dwelt
in the wide world had voices so fair to hear but there seemed to be a note of
haste or fear in his call and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and
urgently to strider
soon strider beckoned to them and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried
down to the road this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said
strider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord to frodo i was sent from
rivendell to look for you we feared that you were in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo joyfully
no he had not when i departed but that was nine days ago answered
glorfindel elrond received news that troubled him some of my kindred
journeying in your land beyond the baranduin* learned that things were amiss
and sent messages as swiftly as they could they said that the nine were abroad
and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for gandalf
had not returned there are few even in rivendell that can ride openly against
the nine but such as there were elrond sent out north west and south it was
thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit and become lost in the
wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i came to the bridge of mitheithel and
left a token there nigh on seven days ago three of the servants of sauron were
upon the bridge but they withdrew and i pursued them westward i came also upon
two others but they turned away southward since then i have searched for your
trail two days ago i found it and followed it over the bridge and today i
marked where you descended from the hills again but come there is no time for
further news since you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go
there are five behind us and when they find your trail upon the road they will
ride after us like the wind and they are not all where the other four may be
i do not know i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened frodo felt a
great weariness come over him ever since the sun began to sink the mist before
his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the
faces of his friends now pain assailed him and he felt cold he swayed
clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily he cant go on riding
after nightfall he needs rest
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground and taking him gently in
his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under weathertop and of the
deadly knife he drew out the hilt which he had kept and handed it to the elf
glorfindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently at it
there are evil things written on this hilt he said though maybe your
eyes cannot see them keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond but
be wary and handle it as little as you may alas the wounds of this weapon are
beyond my skill to heal i will do what i can   but all the more do i urge you
now to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his fingers and his face grew
graver as if what he learned disquieted him but frodo felt the chill lessen in
his side and arm a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand and
the pain grew easier the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him as
if a cloud had been withdrawn he saw his friends faces more clearly again and
a measure of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel i will shorten the stirrups up
to the saddle skins and you must sit as tight as you can but you need not
fear my horse will not let any rider fall that i command him to bear his pace
is light and smooth and if danger presses too near he will bear you away with
a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival
no he will not said frodo i shall not ride him if i am to be carried
off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger
glorfindel smiled i doubt very much he said if your friends would be in
danger if you were not with them the pursuit would follow you and leave us in
peace i think it is you frodo and that which you bear that brings us all in
peril
to that frodo had no answer and he was persuaded to mount glorfindels white
horse the pony was laden instead with a great part of the others burdens so
that they now marched lighter and for a time made good speed but the hobbits
began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the elf on he
led them into the mouth of darkness and still on under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to
halt pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling
legs and even strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary frodo sat
upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road side and
fell asleep immediately they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when
glorfindel who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again the
sun had now climbed far into the morning and the clouds and mists of the night
were gone
drink this said glorfindel to them pouring for each in turn a little
liquor from his silver studded flask of leather it was clear as spring water
and had no taste and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth but
strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it eaten
after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit which was now all that they
had left seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in
the shire had done
they had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the road again
glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief halts during the
days march in this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall and
came to a point where the road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the
valley now making straight for the bruinen so far there had been no sign or
sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often glorfindel would
halt and listen for a moment if they lagged behind and a look of anxiety
clouded his face once or twice he spoke to strider in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it was plain that the hobbits
could go no further that night they were stumbling along dizzy with weariness
and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs frodos pain had
redoubled and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey
he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the world seemed less pale and
empty
the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning
there were many miles yet to go between them and the ford and they hobbled
forward at the best pace they could manage
our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river said glorfindel
for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us and other danger
may be waiting by the ford
the road was still running steadily downhill and there was now in places
much grass at either side in which the hobbits walked when they could to ease
their tired feet in the late afternoon they came to a place where the road went
suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine trees and then plunged into a deep
cutting with steep moist walls of red stone echoes ran along as they hurried
forward and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own
all at once as if through a gate of light the road ran out again from the end
of the tunnel into the open there at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell on the
further side was a steep brown bank threaded by a winding path and behind that
the tall mountains climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into
the fading sky
there was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them a
rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the
pines one moment glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward with a
loud cry
fly he called fly the enemy is upon us
the white horse leaped forward the hobbits ran down the slope glorfindel
and strider followed as rear guard they were only half way across the flat
when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping out of the gate in the
trees that they had just left rode a black rider he reined his horse in and
halted swaying in his saddle another followed him and then another then
again two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him checking the
horse to a walk he turned and looked back the riders seemed to sit upon their
great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all the
woods and land about them receded as if into a mist suddenly he knew in his
heart that they were silently commanding him to wait then at once fear and
hatred awoke in him his hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword
and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and clear he called to
the horse in the elf tongue noro lim noro lim asfaloth
at once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap
of the road at the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in
pursuit and from the riders came a terrible cry such as frodo had heard
filling the woods with horror in the eastfarthing far away it was answered and
to the dismay of frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the
left four other riders came flying two rode towards frodo two galloped madly
towards the ford to cut off his escape they seemed to him to run like the wind
and to grow swiftly larger and darker as their courses converged with his
frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder he could no longer see his
friends the riders behind were falling back even their great steeds were no
match in speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel he looked forward again
and hope faded there seemed no chance of reaching the ford before he was cut
off by the others that had lain in ambush he could see them clearly now they
appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were robed in
white and grey swords were naked in their pale hands helms were on their
heads their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices
fear now filled all frodos mind he thought no longer of his sword no cry
came from him he shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane the wind whistled
in his ears and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill a breath of
deadly cold pierced him like a spear as with a last spurt like a flash of
white fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right before the face
of the foremost rider
frodo heard the splash of water it foamed about his feet he felt the quick
heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path he
was climbing the steep bank he was across the ford
but the pursuers were close behind at the top of the bank the horse halted
and turned about neighing fiercely there were nine riders at the waters edge
below and frodos spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces he
knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done
and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path
from the ford to the edge of rivendell if once the riders crossed in any case
he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt hatred again stirred in him but
he had no longer the strength to refuse
suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward it checked at the
water and reared up with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished his
sword
go back he cried go back to the land of mordor and follow me no more 
his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears the riders halted but frodo
had not the power of bombadil his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and
chilling laughter come back come back they called to mordor we will take
you
go back he whispered
the ring the ring they cried with deadly voices and immediately their
leader urged his horse forward into the water followed closely by two others
by elbereth and lúthien the fair said frodo with a last effort
lifting up his sword you shall have neither the ring nor me
then the leader who was now half across the ford stood up menacing in his
stirrups and raised up his hand frodo was stricken dumb he felt his tongue
cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring his sword broke and fell out of
his shaking hand the elf horse reared and snorted the foremost of the black
horses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing a noise of loud waters
rolling many stones dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down along
its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves white flames seemed to frodo to
flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white
riders upon white horses with frothing manes the three riders that were still
in the midst of the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly
under angry foam those that were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it seemed to him that he
saw beyond the riders that hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white
light and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that flared red in
the grey mist that was falling over the world
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward in terror they
bore their riders into the rushing flood their piercing cries were drowned in
the roaring of the river as it carried them away then frodo felt himself
falling and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together
with his enemies he heard and saw no more
 
 
 
frodo woke and found himself lying in bed at first he thought that he had
slept late after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of
memory or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling looked strange it was flat
and it had dark beams richly carved he lay a little while longer looking at
patches of sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he said aloud to the ceiling in the
house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning said a voice it is the
morning of october the twenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf cried frodo sitting up there was the old wizard sitting in a
chair by the open window
yes he said i am here and you are lucky to be here too after all the
absurd things you have done since you left home frodo lay down again he felt
too comfortable and peaceful to argue and in any case he did not think he would
get the better of an argument he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the disastrous short cut through the old forest the
accident at the prancing pony and his madness in putting on the ring
in the dell under weathertop while he was thinking of all these things and
trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in rivendell there was
a long silence broken only by the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew
white smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length and are the others all right
yes they are all safe and sound answered gandalf sam was here until i
sent him off to get some rest about half an hour ago
what happened at the ford said frodo it all seemed so dim somehow and
it still does
yes it would you were beginning to fade answered gandalf the wound was
overcoming you at last a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid
but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit as you showed in the barrow
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment of all i wish you
could have held out at weathertop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo i have not spoken to
the others about the barrow at first it was too horrible and afterwards there
were other things to think about how do you know about it
you have talked long in your sleep frodo said gandalf gently and it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory do not worry though i said
absurd just now i did not mean it i think well of you   and of the
others it is no small feat to have come so far and through such dangers still
bearing the ring
we should never have done it without strider said frodo but we needed
you i did not know what to do without you
i was delayed said gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin and yet i am
not sure it may have been better so
i wish you would tell me what happened
all in good time you are not supposed to talk or worry about anything
today by elronds orders
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which are quite as
tiring said frodo i am wide awake now and i remember so many things that
want explaining why were you delayed you ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf we shall have a
council as soon as you are well enough at the moment i will only say that i
was held captive
you cried frodo
yes i gandalf the grey said the wizard solemnly there are many powers
in the world for good or for evil some are greater than i am against some i
have not yet been measured but my time is coming the morgul lord and his black
riders have come forth war is preparing
then you knew of the riders already before i met them
yes i knew of them indeed i spoke of them once to you for the black
riders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the lord of the rings but i
did not know that they had arisen again or i should have fled with you at once
i heard news of them only after i left you in june but that story must wait
for the moment we have been saved from disaster by aragorn
yes said frodo it was strider that saved us yet i was afraid of him at
first sam never quite trusted him i think not at any rate until we met
glorfindel
gandalf smiled i have heard all about sam he said he has no more doubts
now
i am glad said frodo for i have become very fond of strider well fond
is not the right word i mean he is dear to me though he is strange and grim
at times in fact he reminds me often of you i didnt know that any of the big
people were like that i thought well that they were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much about men in the shire except perhaps the
breelanders
you dont know much even about them if you think old barliman is stupid
said gandalf he is wise enough on his own ground he thinks less than he
talks and slower yet he can see through a brick wall in time as they say in
bree but there are few left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn the
race of the kings from over the sea is nearly at an end it may be that this war
of the ring will be their last adventure
do you really mean that strider is one of the people of the old kings said
frodo in wonder i thought they had all vanished long ago i thought he was
only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf my dear frodo that is just what the rangers
are the last remnant in the north of the great people the men of the west
they have helped me before and i shall need their help in the days to come for
we have reached rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo but so far my only thought has been to get
here and i hope i shant have to go any further it is very pleasant just to
rest i have had a month of exile and adventure and i find that has been as
much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes after a while he spoke again i have been
reckoning he said and i cant bring the total up to october the
twenty fourth it ought to be the twenty first we must have reached the ford by
the twentieth
you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandalf how
do the side and shoulder feel now
i dont know frodo answered they dont feel at all which is an
improvement but he made an effort i can move my arm again a little yes it
is coming back to life it is not cold he added touching his left hand with
his right
good said gandalf it is mending fast you will soon be sound again
elrond has cured you he has tended you for days ever since you were brought
in
days said frodo
well four nights and three days to be exact the elves brought you from
this where you lost count we have been terribly anxious and sam has hardly
left your side day or night except to run messages elrond is a master of
healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly to tell you the truth i had
very little hope for i suspected that there was some fragment of the blade
still in the closed wound but it could not be found until last night then
elrond removed a splinter it was deeply buried and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had
vanished in striders hands dont be alarmed said gandalf it is gone now
it has been melted and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly i have
known strong warriors of the big people who would quickly have been overcome by
that splinter which you bore for seventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo what were the riders trying
to do
they tried to pierce your heart with a morgul knife which remains in the
wound if they had succeeded you would have become like they are only weaker
and under their command you would have became a wraith under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his ring if
any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his
hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger said frodo faintly i
was mortally afraid of course but if i had known more i should not have dared
even to move it is a marvel that i escaped
yes fortune or fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention
courage for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder was pierced and
that was because you resisted to the last but it was a terribly narrow shave
so to speak you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring for then you
were half in the wraith world yourself and they might have seized you you
could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo they were terrible to behold but why could we all see
their horses
because they are real horses just as the black robes are real robes that
they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the
living
then why do these black horses endure such riders all other animals are
terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel the dogs howl
and the geese scream at them
because these horses are born and bred to the service of the dark lord in
mordor not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are orcs and
trolls there are wargs and werewolves and there have been and still are many
men warriors and kings that walk alive under the sun and yet are under his
sway and their number is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is conquered the elves may fear the dark
lord and they may fly before him but never again will they listen to him or
serve him and here in rivendell there live still some of his chief foes the
elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seas they do not fear
the ringwraiths for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in
both worlds and against both the seen and the unseen they have great power
i thought that i saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the
others was that glorfindel then
yes you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side one of the
mighty of the firstborn he is an elf lord of a house of princes indeed there
is a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor for a while and
elsewhere other powers still dwell there is power too of another kind in the
shire but all such places will soon become islands under siege if things go on
as they are going the dark lord is putting forth all his strength
still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin while his
beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire we must keep up our courage
you will soon be well if i do not talk you to death you are in rivendell and
you need not worry about anything for the present
i havent any courage to keep up said frodo but i am not worried at the
moment just give me news of my friends and tell me the end of the affair at
the ford as i keep on asking and i shall be content for the present after
that i shall have another sleep i think but i shant be able to close my eyes
until you have finished the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at frodo the
colour had come back to his face and his eyes were clear and fully awake and
aware he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him but to the
wizards eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were of transparency
about him and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the
coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself he is not half
through yet and to what he will come in the end not even elrond can foretell
not to evil i think he may become like a glass filled with a clear light for
eyes to see that can
you look splendid he said aloud i will risk a brief tale without
consulting elrond but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again
this is what happened as far as i can gather the riders made straight for you
as soon as you fled they did not need the guidance of their horses any longer
you had become visible to them being already on the threshold of their world
and also the ring drew them your friends sprang aside off the road or they
would have been ridden down they knew that nothing could save you if the white
horse could not the riders were too swift to overtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with stand all the nine
at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind close to the ford
there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees there
they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a flood would come down if
the riders tried to cross and then he would have to deal with any that were
left on his side of the river the moment the flood appeared he rushed out
followed by aragorn and the others with flaming brands caught between fire and
water and seeing an elf lord revealed in his wrath they were dismayed and
their horses were stricken with madness three were carried away by the first
assault of the flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses
and overwhelmed
and is that the end of the black riders asked frodo
no said gandalf their horses must have perished and without them they
are crippled but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to fear from them at present your friends
crossed after the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the
top of the bank with a broken sword under you the horse was standing guard
beside you you were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or
worse elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf the river of this valley is under
his power and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the ford as
soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was
released if i may say so i added a few touches of my own you may not have
noticed but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining
white riders and there were many rolling and grinding boulders for a moment i
was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get out
of hand and wash you all away there is great vigour in the waters that come
down from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it all comes back to me now said frodo the tremendous roaring i
thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies and all but now we are
safe
gandalf looked quickly at frodo but he had shut his eyes yes you are all
safe for the present soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate
the victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all be there in places of
honour
splendid said frodo it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such
great lords not to mention strider should take so much trouble and show me so
much kindness
well there are many reasons why they should said gandalf smiling i am
one good reason the ring is another you are the ring bearer and you are the
heir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily i wonder where he is i wish he was here
and could hear all about it it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the poor old troll with that he fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the last homely house east of the sea that house was
as bilbo had long ago reported a perfect house whether you like food or
sleep or story telling or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a
pleasant mixture of them all merely to be there was a cure for weariness
fear and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and he found that he no longer
felt in need of rest or sleep but had a mind for food and drink and probably
for singing and story telling afterwards he got out of bed and discovered that
his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been he found laid
ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently looking in a
mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he
remembered it looked remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to go
tramping with his uncle in the shire but the eyes looked out at him
thoughtfully
yes you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a
looking glass he said to his reflection but now for a merry meeting
he stretched out his arms and whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on the door and sam came in he ran to
frodo and took his left hand awkwardly and shyly he stroked it gently and then
he blushed and turned hastily away
hullo sam said frodo
its warm said sam meaning your hand mr frodo it has felt so cold
through the long nights but glory and trumpets he cried turning round again
with shining eyes and dancing on the floor its fine to see you up and
yourself again sir gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come
down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo lets go and look for the rest of the party
i can take you to them sir said sam its a big house this and very
peculiar always a bit more to discover and no knowing what youll find round a
corner and elves sir elves here and elves there some like kings terrible
and splendid and some as merry as children and the music and the singing not
that i have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here but
im getting to know some of the ways of the place
i know what you have been doing sam said frodo taking his arm but you
shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content come on guide me
round the corners
sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high
garden above the steep bank of the river he found his friends sitting in a
porch on the side of the house looking east shadows had fallen in the valley
below but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above the
air was warm the sound of running and falling water was loud and the evening
was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers as if summer still lingered
in elronds gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up here is our noble cousin make way for
frodo lord of the ring
hush said gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch evil things
do not come into this valley but all the same we should not name them the lord
of the ring is not frodo but the master of the dark tower of mordor whose
power is again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said pippin he
thinks i need keeping in order but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy
or depressed in this place i feel i could sing if i knew the right song for
the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo though at the moment i feel
more like eating and drinking
that will soon be cured said pippin you have shown your usual cunning in
getting up just in time for a meal
more than meal a feast said merry as soon as gandalf reported that you
were recovered the preparations began he had hardly finished speaking when
they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells
the hall of elronds house was filled with folk elves for the most part
though there were a few guests of other sorts elrond as was his custom sat in
a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais and next to him on the
one side sat glorfindel on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never before seen elrond of whom
so many tales spoke and as they sat upon his right hand and his left
glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so well were revealed as
lords of dignity and power gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two
but his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his broad shoulders
made him look like some wise king of ancient legend in his aged face under
great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly
into fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining gold his face fair
and young and fearless and full of joy his eyes were bright and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neither old nor young though in it was
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful his hair was dark as
the shadows of twilight and upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes were
grey as a clear evening and in them was a light like the light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters and yet hale as a tried
warrior in the fulness of his strength he was the lord of rivendell and mighty
among both elves and men
in the middle of the table against the woven cloths upon the wall there was
a chair under a canopy and there sat a lady fair to look upon and so like was
she in form of womanhood to elrond that frodo guessed that she was one of his
close kindred young she was and yet not so the braids of her dark hair were
touched by no frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth and
the light of stars was in her bright eyes grey as a cloudless night yet
queenly she looked and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of one who
has known many things that the years bring above her brow her head was covered
with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems glittering white but her soft
grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen arwen daughter
of elrond in whom it was said that the likeness of lúthien had come on
earth again and she was called undómiel for she was the evenstar of her
people long she had been in the land of her mothers kin in lórien
beyond the mountains and was but lately returned to rivendell to her fathers
house but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out upon errantry for they
rode often far afield with the rangers of the north forgetting never their
mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living thing frodo had never seen before nor imagined in
his mind and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at
elronds table among all these folk so high and fair though he had a suitable
chair and was raised upon several cushions he felt very small and rather out
of place but that feeling quickly passed the feast was merry and the food all
that his hunger could desire it was some time before he looked about him again
or even turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his
master but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour frodo
could see him now sitting with pippin and merry at the upper end of one of the
side tables close to the dais he could see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly
dressed his beard very long and forked was white nearly as white as the
snow white cloth of his garments he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diamonds frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him then he actually
rose from his seat and bowed glóin at your service he said and bowed
still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodo correctly
rising in surprise and scattering his cushions am i right in guessing that you
are the glóin one of the twelve companions of the great thorin
oakenshield
quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the cushions and courteously
assisting frodo back into his seat and i do not ask for i have already been
told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend bilbo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
you have had some very strange adventures i hear said glóin i
wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey nothing
like it has happened since bilbo came with us but perhaps i should not inquire
too closely since elrond and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this
i think we will not speak of it at least not yet said frodo politely
he guessed that even in elronds house the matter of the ring was not one for
casual talk and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time but i
am equally curious he added to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far
from the lonely mountain
glóin looked at him if you have not heard i think we will not speak
yet of that either master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe and
then we shall all hear many things but there is much else that may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together but frodo listened more
than he spoke for the news of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimportant while glóin had much to tell of events in the
northern regions of wilderland frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of
beorn was now the lord of many sturdy men and to their land between the
mountains and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glóin if it were not for the beornings the passage
from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible they are valiant
men and keep open the high pass and the ford of carrock but their tolls are
high he added with a shake of his head and like beorn of old they are not
over fond of dwarves still they are trusty and that is much in these days
nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale they are good
folk the bardings the grandson of bard the bowman rules them brand son of
bain son of bard he is a strong king and his realm now reaches far south and
east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked frodo
there is much to tell good and bad said glóin yet it is mostly
good we have so far been fortunate though we do not escape the shadow of these
times if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly but
stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues run on when speaking of their
handiwork they say
and with that glóin embarked on a long account of the doings of the
dwarf kingdom he was delighted to have found so polite a listener for frodo
showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject though
actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard of before he was interested however to hear that dáin
was still king under the mountain and was now old having passed his two
hundred and fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rich of the ten
companions who had survived the battle of five armies seven were still with him
dwalin glóin dori nori bifur bofur and bombur bombur was now so
fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table and it
took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has become of balin and ori and óin asked frodo
a shadow passed over glóins face we do not know he answered it
is largely on account of balin that i have come to ask the advice of those that
dwell in rivendell but tonight let us speak of merrier things
glóin began then to talk of the works of his people telling frodo
about their great labours in dale and under the mountain we have done well
he said but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of whose secrets
are lost we make good armour and keen swords but we cannot again make mail or
blade to match those that were made before the dragon came only in mining and
building have we surpassed the old days you should see the waterways of dale
frodo and the fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads of
many colours and the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches
carved like trees and the terraces and towers upon the mountains sides then
you would see that we have not been idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo how surprised bilbo
would have been to see all the changes in the desolation of smaug
glóin looked at frodo and smiled you were very fond of bilbo were
you not he asked
yes answered frodo i would rather see him than all the towers and
palaces in the world
at length the feast came to an end elrond and arwen rose and went down the
hall and the company followed them in due order the doors were thrown open
and they went across a wide passage and through other doors and came into a
further hall in it were no tables but a bright fire was burning in a great
hearth between the carven pillars upon either side
frodo found himself walking with gandalf this is the hall of fire said the
wizard here you will hear many songs and tales if you can keep awake but
except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet and people come here who
wish for peace and thought there is always a fire here all the year round
but there is little other light
as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him elvish
minstrels began to make sweet music slowly the hall filled and frodo looked
with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair suddenly he noticed not
far from the further end of the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool with
his back propped against a pillar beside him on the ground was a drinking cup
and some bread frodo wondered whether he was ill if people were ever ill in
rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast his head seemed sunk in
sleep on his breast and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure awake little master
he said with a smile then turning to frodo he beckoned to him now at last
the hour has come that you have wished for frodo he said here is a friend
that you have long missed
the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frodo with sudden recognition and he sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo so you have got here at last i hoped you
would manage it well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear i
hope you enjoyed yourself
why werent you there cried frodo and why havent i been allowed to see
you before
because you were asleep i have seen a good deal of you i have sat by your
side with sam each day but as for the feast i dont go in for such things much
now and i had something else to do
what were you doing
why sitting and thinking i do a lot of that nowadays and this is the best
place to do it in as a rule wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at
elrond there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that frodo
could see wake up i was not asleep master elrond if you want to know you
have all come out from your feast too soon and you have disturbed me in the
middle of making up a song i was stuck over a line or two and was thinking
about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right there will be
such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out of my head i
shall have to get my friend the dúnadan to help me where is he
elrond laughed he shall be found he said then you two shall go into a
corner and finish your task and we will hear it and judge it before we end our
merrymaking messengers were sent to find bilbos friend though none knew
where he was or why he had not been present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side and sam came quickly and
placed himself near them they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the
mirth and music in the hall about them bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly along the road or in
the country on either side but somehow he had steered all the time towards
rivendell i got here without much adventure he said and after a rest i
went on with the dwarves to dale my last journey i shant travel again old
balin had gone away then i came back here and here i have been i have done
this and that i have written some more of my book and of course i make up a
few songs they sing them occasionally just to please me i think for of
course they arent really good enough for rivendell and i listen and i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just is a remarkable place altogether
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains and out of the south but
hardly anything from the shire i heard about the ring of course gandalf has
been here often not that he has told me a great deal he has become closer than
ever these last few years the dúnadan has told me more fancy that ring
of mine causing such a disturbance it is a pity that gandalf did not find out
more sooner i could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much
trouble i have thought several times of going back to hobbiton for it but i am
getting old and they would not let me gandalf and elrond i mean they seemed
to think that the enemy was looking high and low for me and would make
mincemeat of me if he caught me tottering about in the wild
and gandalf said the ring has passed on bilbo it would do no good
to you or to others if you tried to meddle with it again odd sort of
remark just like gandalf but he said he was looking after you so i let things
be i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound he paused and looked at
frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he asked in a whisper i cant help feeling curious
you know after all ive heard i should very much like just to peep at it
again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance it looks
just the same as ever it did
well i should just like to see it for a moment said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that while he slept the ring had been hung
about his neck on a new chain light but strong slowly he drew it out bilbo
put out his hand but frodo quickly drew back the ring to his distress and
amazement he found that he was no longer looking at bilbo a shadow seemed to
have fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing a little
wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands he felt a desire to
strike him
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell bilbo
looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes i
understand now he said put it away i am sorry sorry you have come in for
this burden sorry about everything dont adventures ever have an end i
suppose not someone else always has to carry on the story well it cant be
helped i wonder if its any good trying to finish my book but dont lets
worry about it now lets have some real news tell me all about the shire
frodo hid the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of
memory the light and music of rivendell was about him again bilbo smiled and
laughed happily every item of news from the shire that frodo could tell aided
and corrected now and again by sam was of the greatest interest to him from the
felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton they
were so deep in the doings of the four farthings that they did not notice the
arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth for many minutes he stood looking
down at them with a smile
suddenly bilbo looked up ah there you are at last dúnadan he
cried
strider said frodo you seem to have a lot of names
well strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said
bilbo what do you call him that for
they call me that in bree said strider laughing and that is how i was
introduced to him
and why do you call him dúnadan asked frodo
the dúnadan said bilbo he is often called that here but i
thought you knew enough elvish at least to know dún udan man of
the west númenorean but this is not the time for lessons he turned to
strider
where have you been my friend why werent you at the feast the lady arwen
was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely i know he said but often i must
put mirth aside elladan and elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked for
and they had tidings that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard the news cant you
spare me a moment i want your help in something urgent elrond says this song
of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening and i am stuck lets
go off into a corner and polish it up
strider smiled come then he said let me hear it
frodo was left to himself for a while for sam had fallen asleep he was
alone and felt rather forlorn although all about him the folk of rivendell were
gathered but those near him were silent intent upon the music of the voices
and the instruments and they gave no heed to anything else frodo began to
listen
at first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in
elven tongues even though he understood them little held him in a spell as
soon as he began to attend to them almost it seemed that the words took shape
and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened
out before him and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of
foam that sighed upon the margins of the world then the enchantment became more
and more dreamlike until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and
silver was flowing over him too multitudinous for its pattern to be
comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about him and it drenched and
drowned him swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of
sleep
there he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water
and then suddenly into a voice it seemed to be the voice of bilbo chanting
verses faint at first and then clearer ran the words
eärendil was a mariner

that tarried in arvernien

he built a boat of timber felled

in nimbrethil to journey in

her sails he wove of silver fair

of silver were her lanterns made

her prow was fashioned like a swan

and light upon her banners laid



in panoply of ancient kings

in chain‚d rings he armoured him

his shining shield was scored with runes

to ward all wounds and harm from him

his bow was made of dragon horn

his arrows shorn of ebony

of silver was his habergeon

his scabbard of chalcedony

his sword of steel was valiant

of adamant his helmet tall

an eagle plume upon his crest

upon his breast an emerald



beneath the moon and under star

he wandered far from northern strands

bewildered on enchanted ways

beyond the days of mortal lands

from gnashing of the narrow ice

where shadow lies on frozen hills

from nether heats and burning waste

he turned in haste and roving still

on starless waters far astray

at last he came to night of naught

and passed and never sight he saw

of shining shore nor light he sought



the winds of wrath came driving him

and blindly in the foam he fled

from west to east and errandless

unheralded he homeward sped



there flying elwing came to him

and flame was in the darkness lit

more bright than light of diamond

the fire upon her carcanet

the silmaril she bound on him

and crowned him with the living light

and dauntless then with burning brow

he turned his prow and in the night

from otherworld beyond the sea

there strong and free a storm arose

a wind of power in tarmenel

by paths that seldom mortal goes

his boat it bore with biting breath

as might of death across the grey

and long forsaken seas distressed

from east to west he passed away



through evernight he back was borne

on black and roaring waves that ran

oer leagues unlit and foundered shores

that drowned before the days began

until he heard on strands of pearl

when ends the world the music long

where ever foaming billows roll

the yellow gold and jewels wan

he saw the mountain silent rise

where twilight lies upon the knees

of valinor and eldamar

beheld afar beyond the seas

a wanderer escaped from night

to haven white he came at last

to elvenhome the green and fair

where keen the air where pale as glass

beneath the hill of ilmarin

a glimmer in a valley sheer

the lamplit towers of tirion

are mirrored on the shadowmere



he tarried there from errantry

and melodies they taught to him

and sages old him marvels told

and harps of gold they brought to him

they clothed him then in elven white

and seven lights before him sent

as through the calacirian

to hidden land forlorn he went

he came unto the timeless halls

where shining fall the countless years

and endless reigns the elder king

in ilmarin on mountain sheer

and words unheard were spoken then

of folk of men and elven kin

beyond the world were visions showed

forbid to those that dwell therein



a ship then new they built for him

of mithril and of elven glass

with shining prow no shaven oar

nor sail she bore on silver mast

the silmaril as lantern light

and banner bright with living flame

to gleam thereon by elbereth

herself was set who thither came

and wings immortal made for him

and laid on him undying doom

to sail the shoreless skies and come

behind the sun and light of moon



from everevens lofty hills

where softly silver fountains fall

his wings him bore a wandering light

beyond the mighty mountain wall

from worlds end then he turned away

and yearned again to find afar

his home through shadows journeying

and burning as an island star

on high above the mists he came

a distant flame before the sun

a wonder ere the waking dawn

where grey the norland waters run



and over middle earth he passed

and heard at last the weeping sore

of women and of elven maids

in elder days in years of yore

gut on him mighty doom was laid

till moon should fade an orb‚d star

to pass and tarry never more

on hither shores where mortals are

for ever still a herald on

an errand that should never rest

to bear his shining lamp afar

the flammifer of westernesse
the chanting ceased frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated on
his stool in a circle of listeners who were smiling and applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed i am flattered lindir he said but it would be
too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring for you the elves answered laughing you know you are
never tired of reciting your own verses but really we cannot answer your
question at one hearing
what cried bilbo you cant tell which parts were mine and which were
the dúnadans
it is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals said the
elf
nonsense lindir snorted bilbo if you cant distinguish between a man
and a hobbit your judgement is poorer than i imagined theyre as different as
peas and apples
maybe to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laughed lindir or
to shepherds but mortals have not been our study we have other business
i wont argue with you said bilbo i am sleepy after so much music and
singing ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo well thats over he said in a low
voice it went off better than i expected i dont often get asked for a second
hearing what did you think of it
i am not going to try and guess said frodo smiling
you neednt said bilbo as a matter of fact it was all mine except that
aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone he seemed to think it
important i dont know why otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing
rather above my head and he said that if i had the cheek to make verses about eärendil
in the house of elrond it was my affair i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant
explain i was half asleep when you began and it seemed to follow on from
something that i was dreaming about i didnt understand that it was really you
speaking until near the end
it is difficult to keep awake here until you get used to it said
bilbo not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music
and poetry and tales they seem to like them as much as food or more they will
be going on for a long time yet what do you say to slipping off for some more
quiet talk
can we said frodo
of course this is merrymaking not business come and go as you like as
long as you dont make a noise
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows and made for the doors
sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face in spite of
his delight in bilbos company frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of
the hall of fire even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice
rose in song
a elbereth gilthoniel

silivren penna míriel

o menel aglar elenath

na chaered palan díriel

o galadhremmin ennorath

fanuilos le linnathon

nef aear sí nef aearon
frodo halted for a moment looking back elrond was in his chair and the fire
was on his face like summer light upon the trees near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her his dark cloak was
thrown back and he seemed to be clad in elven mail and a star shone on his
breast they spoke together and then suddenly it seemed to frodo that arwen
turned towards him and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced
his heart
he stood still enchanted while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell
like clear jewels of blended word and melody it is a song to elbereth said
bilbo they will sing that and other songs of the blessed realm many times
tonight come on
he led frodo back to his own little room it opened on to the gar dens and
looked south across the ravine of the bruinen there they sat for some while
looking through the window at the bright stars above the steep climbing woods
and talking softly they spoke no more of the small news of the shire far away
nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them but of the fair things
they had seen in the world together of the elves of the stars of trees and
the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last there came a knock on the door begging your pardon said sam
putting in his head but i was just wondering if you would be wanting
anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo i guess you mean that it is
time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorrow i hear and he only got up
today for the first time
quite right sam laughed bilbo you can trot off and tell gandalf that he
has gone to bed good night frodo bless me but it has been good to see you
again there are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk i am
getting very old and i began to wonder if i should ever live to see your
chapters of our story good night ill take a walk i think and look at the
stars of elbereth in the garden sleep well
 
next day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well he walked along the
terraces above the loud flowing bruinen and watched the pale cool sun rise
above the far mountains and shine down slanting through the thin silver mist
the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossamer
twinkled on every bush sam walked beside him saying nothing but sniffing the
air and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great
heights in the east the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon gandalf
and bilbo deep in talk hullo good morning said bilbo feel ready for the
great council
i feel ready for anything answered frodo but most of all i should like
to go walking today and explore the valley i should like to get into those
pine woods up there he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you may have a chance later said gandalf but we cannot make any plans
yet there is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out that is the
warning bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf come along now both
you and bilbo are wanted
frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to
the house behind them uninvited and for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found his friends the evening
before the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley the
noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river bed birds were singing
and a wholesome peace lay on the land to frodo his dangerous flight and the
rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were turned to meet them as
they entered were grave
elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him frodo
saw glorfindel and glóin and in a corner alone strider was sitting clad
in his old travel worn clothes again elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side
and presented him to the company saying
here my friends is the hobbit frodo son of drogo few have ever come
hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met before there was
a younger dwarf at glóins side his son gimli beside glorfindel there
were several other counsellors of elronds household of whom erestor was the
chief and with him was galdor an elf from the grey havens who had come on an
errand from círdan the shipwright there was also a strange elf clad in
green and brown legolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king of
the elves of northern mirkwood and seated a little apart was a tall man with a
fair and noble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback and indeed though
his garments were rich and his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with
long travel he had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set
his locks were shorn about his shoulders on a baldric he wore a great horn
tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees he gazed at frodo and bilbo
with sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel i have bidden him to be
present for here his questions will be answered
not all that was spoken and debated in the council need now be told much was
said of events in the world outside especially in the south and in the wide
lands east of the mountains of these things frodo had already heard many
rumours but the tale of glóin was new to him and when the dwarf spoke
he listened attentively it appeared that amid the splendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glóin that a shadow of disquiet
fell upon our people whence it came we did not at first perceive words began
to be whispered in secret it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place
and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world some
spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own
tongue khazad dûm and they declared that now at last we had the power and
numbers to return
glóin sighed moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved there and woke the nameless fear long have its vast mansions lain empty
since the children of durin fled but now we spoke of it again with longing and
yet with dread for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of khazad dûm for
many lives of kings save thrór only and he perished at last however
balin listened to the whispers and resolved to go and though dáin did
not give leave willingly he took with him ori and óin and many of our
folk and they went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago for a while we had news and it
seemed good messages reported that moria had been entered and a great work
begun there then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
then about a year ago a messenger came to dáin but not from
moria   from mordor a horseman in the night who called dáin to his
gate the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship rings he
would give for it such as he gave of old and he asked urgently concerning hobbits
of what kind they were and where they dwelt for sauron knows said
he that one of these was known to you on a time
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer and then his fell
voice was lowered and he would have sweetened it if he could as a small
token only of your friendship sauron asks this he said that you
should find this thief such was his word and get from him willing
or no a little ring the least of rings that once he stole it is but a trifle
that sauron fancies and an earnest of your good will find it and three rings
that the dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you and the realm of
moria shall be yours for ever find only news of the thief whether he still
lives and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the
lord refuse and things will not seem so well do you refuse
at that his breath came like the hiss of snakes and all who stood by
shuddered but dáin said i say neither yea nor nay i must
consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak
 consider well but not too long said he
 the time of my thought is my own to spend answered dáin
 for the present said he and rode into the darkness
heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night we needed not
the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and
deceit for we knew already that the power that has re entered mordor has not
changed and ever it betrayed us of old twice the messenger has returned and
has gone unanswered the third and last time so he says is soon to come
before the ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by dáin to warn bilbo that he is
sought by the enemy and to learn if may be why he desires this ring this
least of rings also we crave the advice of elrond for the shadow grows and
draws nearer we discover that messengers have come also to king brand in dale
and that he is afraid we fear that he may yield already war is gathering on
his eastern borders if we make no answer the enemy may move men of his rule to
assail king brand and dáin also
you have done well to come said elrond you will hear today all that you
need in order to understand the purposes of the enemy there is naught that you
can do other than to resist with hope or without it but you do not stand
alone you will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the
western world the ring what shall we do with the ring the least of rings the
trifle that sauron fancies that is the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hither called i say though i
have not called you to me strangers from distant lands you have come and are
here met in this very nick of time by chance as it may seem yet it is not so
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who sit here and none others
must now find counsel for the peril of the world
now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all
but a few until this day and first so that all may understand what is the
peril the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning even to this
present and i will begin that tale though others shall end it
then all listened while elrond in his clear voice spoke of sauron and the
rings of power and their forging in the second age of the world long ago a
part of his tale was known to some there but the full tale to none and many
eyes were turned t= elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the elven smiths of
eregion and their friendship with moria and their eagerness for knowledge by
which sauron ensnared them for in that time he was not yet evil to behold and
they received his aid and grew mighty in craft whereas he learned all their
secrets and betrayed them and forged secretly in the mountain of fire the one
ring to be their master but celebrimbor was aware of him and hid the three
which he had made and there was war and the land was laid waste and the gate
of moria was shut
then through all the years that followed he traced the ring but since that
history is elsewhere recounted even as elrond himself set it down in his books
of lore it is not here recalled for it is a long tale full of deeds great and
terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode up the sky and the
morning was passing ere he ceased
of númenor he spoke its glory and its fall and the return of the
kings of men to middle earth out of the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings
of storm then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and anárion
became great lords and the north realm they made in arnor and the south realm
in gondor above the mouths of anduin but sauron of mordor assailed them and
they made the last alliance of elves and men and the hosts of gil galad and
elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed i remember well the splendour of
their banners he said it recalled to me the glory of the elder days and the
hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled and yet
not so many nor so fair as when thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed
that evil was ended for ever and it was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment
but i thought he stammered as elrond turned towards him i thought that the
fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was indeed answered elrond gravely but my memory reaches back even
to the elder days eärendil was my sire who was born in gondolin before
its fall and my mother was elwing daughter of dior son of lúthien of
doriath i have seen three ages in the west of the world and many defeats and
many fruitless victories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched with his host i was at the battle
of dagorlad before the black gate of mordor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galad and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could
withstand i beheld the last combat on the slopes of orodruin where gil galad
died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath him but sauron himself was
overthrown and isildur cut the ring from his hand with the hilt shard of his
fathers sword and took it for his own
at this the stranger boromir broke in so that is what became of the
ring he cried if ever such a tale was told in the south it has long been
forgotten i have heard of the great ring of him that we do not name but we
believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm isildur
took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond isildur took it as should not have been it
should have been cast then into orodruins fire nigh at hand where it was made
but few marked what isildur did he alone stood by his father in that last
mortal contest and by gil galad only círdan stood and i but isildur
would not listen to our counsel
 this i will have as weregild for my father and my brother he
said and therefore whether we would or no he took it to treasure it but soon
he was betrayed by it to his death and so it is named in the north isildurs
bane yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him
only to the north did these tidings come and only to a few small wonder it
is that you have not heard them boromir from the ruin of the gladden fields
where isildur perished three men only came ever back over the mountains after
long wandering one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who bore the
shards of the sword of elendil and he brought them to valandil the heir of
isildur who being but a child had remained here in rivendell but narsil was
broken and its light extinguished and it has not yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance not wholly so yet it
did not achieve its end sauron was diminished but not destroyed his ring was
lost but not unmade the dark tower was broken but its foundations were not
removed for they were made with the power of the ring and while it remains
they will endure many elves and many mighty men and many of their friends had
perished in the war anárion was slain and isildur was slain and
gil galad and elendil were no more never again shall there be any such league
of elves and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and the two
kindreds are estranged and ever since that day the race of númenor has
decayed and the span of their years has lessened
in the north after the war and the slaughter of the gladden fields the men
of westernesse were diminished and their city of annúminas beside lake
evendim fell into ruin and the heirs of valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north downs and that now too is desolate men call it deadmens
dike and they fear to tread there for the folk of arnor dwindled and their
foes devoured them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the
grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and for a while its splendour
grew recalling somewhat of the might of númenor ere it fell high
towers that people built and strong places and havens of many ships and the
winged crown of the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongues their
chief city was osgiliath citadel of the stars through the midst of which the
river flowed and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon eastward
upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and westward at the feet of the
white mountains minas anor they made tower of the setting sun there in the
courts of the king grew a white tree from the seed of that tree which isildur
brought over the deep waters and the seed of that tree before came from eressëa
and before that out of the uttermost west in the day before days when the world
was young
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle earth the line of meneldil
son of anárion failed and the tree withered and the blood of the númenoreans
became mingled with that of lesser men then the watch upon the walls of mordor
slept and dark things crept back to gorgoroth and on a time evil things came
forth and they took minas ithil and abode in it and they made it into a place
of dread and it is called minas morgul the tower of sorcery then minas anor
was named anew minas tirith the tower of guard and these two cities were ever
at war but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows
walked
so it has been for many lives of men but the lords of minas tirith still
fight on defying our enemies keeping the passage of the river from argonath to
the sea and now that part of the tale that i shall tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed out of all knowledge and the
three were released from its dominion but now in this latter day they are in
peril once more for to our sorrow the one has been found others shall speak of
its finding for in that i played small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them give me
leave master elrond said he first to say more of gondor for verily from the
land of gondor i am come and it would be well for all to know what passes
there for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore guess little of their
peril if we should fail at last
believe not that in the land of gondor the blood of númenor is spent
nor all its pride and dignity forgotten by our valour the wild folk of the east
are still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay and thus alone are
peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us bulwark of the west but if
the passages of the river should be won what then
yet that hour maybe is not now far away the nameless enemy has arisen
again smoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom the power of
the black land grows and we are hard beset when the enemy returned our folk
were driven from ithilien our fair domain east of the river though we kept a
foothold there and strength of arms but this very year in the days of june
sudden war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away we were
outnumbered for mordor has allied itself with the easterlings and the cruel
haradrim but it was not by numbers that we were defeated a power was there
that we have not felt before
some said that it could be seen like a great black horseman a dark shadow
under the moon wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear fell on our
boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled only a remnant of our eastern
force came back destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of
osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridge until it was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others but
still we fight on holding all the west shores of anduin and those who shelter
behind us give us praise if ever they hear our name much praise but little
help only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to
elrond a hundred and ten days i have journeyed all alone but i do not seek
allies in war the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said i
come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words for on the eve of the
sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards a
like dream came oft to him again and once to me
in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing
thunder but in the west a pale light lingered and out of it i heard a voice
remote but clear crying
seek for the sword that was broken

in imladris it dwells

there shall be counsels taken

stronger than morgul spells

there shall be shown a token

that doom is near at hand

for isildurs bane shall waken

and the halfling forth shall stand
of these words we could understand little and we spoke to our father
denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor this only would he
say that imladris was of old the name among the elves of a far northern dale
where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters therefore my
brother seeing how desperate was our need was eager to heed the dream and seek
for imladris but since the way was full of doubt and danger i took the journey
upon myself loth was my father to give me leave and long have i wandered by
roads forgotten seeking the house of elrond of which many had heard but few
knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shall be made clear to you said
aragorn standing up he cast his sword upon the table that stood before elrond
and the blade was in two pieces here is the sword that was broken he said
and who are you and what have you to do with minas tirith asked boromir
looking in wonder at the lean face of the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathorn said elrond and he is descended through
many fathers from isildur elendils son of minas ithil he is the chief of the dúnedain
in the north and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me at all cried frodo in amazement
springing to his feet as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it does not belong to either of us said aragorn but it has been ordained
that you should hold it for a while
bring out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly the time has come hold
it up and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle
there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo he was shaken by a
sudden shame and fear and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring and a
loathing of its touch he wished he was far away the ring gleamed and flickered
as he held it up before them in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing the halfling he
muttered is then the doom of minas tirith come at last but why then should we
seek a broken sword
the words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragorn but doom
and great deeds are indeed at hand for the sword that was broken is the sword
of elendil that broke beneath him when he fell it has been treasured by his
heirs when all other heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among us that
it should be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found now you have
seen the sword that you have sought what would you ask do you wish for the
house of elendil to return to the land of gondor
i was not sent to beg any boon but to seek only the meaning of a riddle
answered boromir proudly yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil
would be a help beyond our hope if such a thing could indeed return out of the
shadows of the past he looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side evidently he was annoyed on
his friends behalf standing suddenly up he burst out
all that is gold does not glitter

not all those who wander are lost

the old that is strong does not wither

deep roots are not reached by the frost



from the ashes a fire shall be woken

a light from the shadows shall spring

renewed shall be blade that was broken

the crownless again shall be king
not very good perhaps but to the point   if you need more beyond the word
of elrond if that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear you
had best listen to it he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispered to frodo for the dúnadan a
long time ago when he first told me about himself i almost wish that my
adventures were not over and that i could go with him when his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again for my part i
forgive your doubt he said little do i resemble the figures of elendil and
isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of denethor i am but
the heir of isildur not isildur himself i have had a hard life and a long and
the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a small part in the count of my
journeys i have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden many
plains even into the far countries of rhûn and harad where the stars are
strange
but my home such as i have is in the north for here the heirs of valandil
have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever the sword has passed to a
new keeper and this i will say to you boromir ere i end lonely men are we
rangers of the wild hunters  but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy for
they are found in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has been a stalwart tower we have played another part
many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay
you know little of the lands beyond your bounds peace and freedom do you say
the north would have known them little but for us fear would have destroyed
them but when dark things come from the houseless hills or creep from sunless
woods they fly from us what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homes of simple men at night if the dúnedain
were asleep or were all gone into the grave
and yet less thanks have we than you travellers scowl at us and countrymen
give us scornful names strider i am to one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little town in
ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly yet we would not have it otherwise if
simple folk are free from care and fear simple they will be and we must be
secret to keep them so that has been the task of my kindred while the years
have lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is changing once again a new hour comes isildurs bane
is found battle is at hand the sword shall be reforged i will come to minas
tirith
isildurs bane is found you say said boromir i have seen a bright ring
in the halflings hand but isildur perished ere this age of the world began
they say how do the wise know that this ring is his and how has it passed down
the years until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger
that shall be told said elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo already the sun is climbing to
noon and i feel the need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling but i do so now come tell us
your tale and if you have not yet cast your story into verse you may tell it
in plain words the briefer the sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo i will do as you bid but i will now tell the true
story and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise   he looked sidelong at
glóin   i ask them to forget it and forgive me i only wished to claim
the treasure as my very own in those days and to be rid of the name of thief
that was put on me but perhaps i understand things a little better now anyway
this is what happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and they listened with amazement
while the old hobbit actually not at all displeased recounted his adventure
with gollum at full length he did not omit a single riddle he would have
given also an account of his party and disappearance from the shire if he had
been allowed but elrond raised his hand
well told my friend he said but that is enough at this time for the
moment it suffices to know that the ring passed to frodo your heir let him now
speak
then less willingly than bilbo frodo told of all his dealings with the ring
from the day that it passed into his keeping every step of his journey from
hobbiton to the ford of bruinen was questioned and considered and everything
that he could recall concerning the black riders was examined at last he sat
down again
not bad bilbo said to him you would have made a good story of it if
they hadnt kept on interrupting i tried to make a few notes but we shall have
to go over it all again together some time if i am to write it up there are
whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here
yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo but the story still does
not seem complete to me i still want to know a good deal especially about
gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by overheard him you speak for me
also he cried and turning to elrond he said the wise may have good reason
to believe that the halflings trove is indeed the great ring of long debate
unlikely though that may seem to those who know less but may we not hear the
proofs and i would ask this also what of saruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us what is his counsel if he knows the things
that we have heard
the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond i had
not overlooked them and they shall be answered but these things it is the part
of gandalf to make clear and i call upon him last for it is the place of
honour and in all this matter he has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would think the tidings of glóin and
the pursuit of frodo proof enough that the halflings trove is a thing of great
worth to the enemy yet it is a ring what then the nine the nazgûl keep
the seven are taken or destroyed at this glóin stirred but did not
speak the three we know of what then is this one that he desires so much
there is indeed a wide waste of time between the river and the mountain
between the loss and the finding but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has
been filled at last yet too slowly for the enemy has been close behind closer
even than i feared and well is it that not until this year this very summer
as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remember that many years ago i myself dared to pass the doors
of the necromancer in dol guldur and secretly explored his ways and found thus
that our fears were true he was none other than sauron our enemy of old at
length taking shape and power again some too will remember also that saruman
dissuaded us from open deeds against him and for long we watched him only yet
at last as his shadow grew saruman yielded and the council put forth its
strength and drove the evil out of mirkwood and that was in the very year of the
finding of this ring a strange chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw sauron also had watched us and had
long prepared against our stroke governing mordor from afar through minas
morgul where his nine servants dwelt until all was ready then he gave way
before us but only feigned to flee and soon after came to the dark tower and
openly declared himself then for the last time the council met for now we
learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one we feared then that
he had some news of it that we knew nothing of but saruman said nay and
repeated what he had said to us before that the one would never again be found
in middle earth
 at the worst said he our enemy knows that we have it
not and that it still is lost but what was lost may yet be found he thinks
fear not his hope will cheat him have i not earnestly studied this matter
into anduin the great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it was rolled
down the river to the sea there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the
misty mountains at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain
hidden he sighed
there i was at fault he said i was lulled by the words of saruman the
wise but i should have sought for the truth sooner and our peril would now be
less
we were all at fault said elrond and but for your vigilance the
darkness maybe would already be upon us but say on
from the first my heart misgave me against all reason that i knew said
gandalf and i desired to know how this thing came to gollum and how long he
had possessed it so i set a watch for him guessing that he would ere long come
forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure he came but he escaped and
was not found and then alas i let the matter rest watching and waiting only
as we have too often done
time passed with many cares until my doubts were awakened again to sudden
fear whence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was true should be done
with it those things i must decide but i spoke yet of my dread to none
knowing the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray in all the long
wars with the dark tower treason has ever been our greatest foe
that was seventeen years ago soon i became aware that spies of many sorts
even beasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew i called
for the help of the dúnedain and their watch was doubled and i opened
my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur
and i said aragorn counselled that we should hunt for gollum too late
though it may seem and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should labour to
repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of wilderland down
even to the mountains of shadow and the fences of mordor there we had rumour
of him and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we never
found him and at last i despaired and then in my despair i thought again of a
test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded the ring itself might tell
if it were the one the memory of words at the council came back to me words of
saruman half heeded at the time i heard them now clearly in my heart
 the nine the seven and the three he said had each
their proper gem not so the one it was round and unadorned as it were one of
the lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled maybe could
still see and read
what those marks were he had not said who now would know the maker and
saruman but great though his lore may be it must have a source what hand save
saurons ever held this thing ere it was lost the hand of isildur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor in
former days the members of my order had been well received there but saruman
most of all often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city less
welcome did the lord denethor show me then than of old and grudgingly he
permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books
 if indeed you look only as you say for records of ancient days and
the beginnings of the city read on  he said for to me what was is
less dark than what is to come and that is my care but unless you have more
skill even than saruman who has studied here long you will find naught that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this city
so said denethor and yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now
can read even of the lore masters for their scripts and tongues have become
dark to later men and boromir there lies in minas tirith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and myself since the kings failed a scroll that
isildur made himself for isildur did not march away straight from the war in
mordor as some have told the tale
some in the north maybe boromir broke in all know in gondor that he
went first to minas anor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom in that time he
planted there the last sapling of the white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll said gandalf and that is not
remembered in gondor it would seem for this scroll concerns the ring and thus
wrote isildur therein
the great ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the north kingdom but
records of it shall be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs of elendil
lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim
and after these words isildur described the ring such as he found it
it was hot when i first took it hot as a glede and my hand was scorched so
that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it yet even as i
write it is cooled and it seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its
beauty nor its shape already the writing upon it which at first was as clear
as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read it is fashioned in an
elven script of eregion for they have no letters in mordor for such subtle
work but the language is unknown to me i deem it to be a tongue of the black
land since it is foul and uncouth what evil it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall the ring misseth maybe
the heat of saurons hand which was black and yet burned like fire and so
gil galad was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again the writing
would be refreshed but for my part i will risk no hurt to this thing of all
the works of sauron the only fair it is precious to me though i buy it with
great pain
when i read these words my quest was ended for the traced writing was
indeed as isildur guessed in the tongue of mordor and the servants of the
tower and what was said therein was already known for in the day that sauron
first put on the one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of him and
from afar he heard him speak these words and so his evil purposes were
revealed
at once i took my leave of denethor but even as i went northwards messages
came to me out of lórien that aragorn had passed that way and that he
had found the creature called gollum therefore i went first to meet him and
hear his tale into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn if a man must needs
walk in sight of the black gate or tread the deadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils he will have i too despaired at last and i began my homeward
journey and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i sought the marks of
soft feet beside a muddy pool but now the trail was fresh and swift and it led
not to mordor but away along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it and
then i had him lurking by a stagnant mere peering in the water as the dark eve
fell i caught him gollum he was covered with green slime he will never love
me i fear for he bit me and i was not gentle nothing more did i ever get
from his mouth than the marks of his teeth i deemed it the worst part of all my
journey the road back watching him day and night making him walk before me
with a halter on his neck gagged until he was tamed by lack of drink and food
driving him ever towards mirkwood i brought him there at last and gave him to
the elves for we had agreed that this should be done and i was glad to be rid
of his company for he stank for my part i hope never to look upon him again
but gandalf came and endured long speech with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not without profit for one thing
the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly
for the first time but that mattered little since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollums ring came out of the great river nigh to
the gladden fields and i learned also that he had possessed it long many lives
of his small kind the power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond
their span but that power only the great rings wield
and if that is not proof enough galdor there is the other test that i
spoke of upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft round and
unadorned the letters that isildur reported may still be read if one has the
strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while that i have done
and this i have read
ash nazg durbatulûk ash nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulûk agh
burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding suddenly it became menacing
powerful harsh as stone a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and the
porch for a moment grew dark all trembled and the elves stopped their ears
never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in
imladris gandalf the grey said elrond as the shadow passed and the company
breathed once more
and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond for if that tongue is not
soon to be heard in every corner of the west then let all put doubt aside that
this thing is indeed what the wise have declared the treasure of the enemy
fraught with all his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old
out of the black years come the words that the smiths of eregion heard and knew
that they had been betrayed
one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all
and in the darkness bind them
know also my friends that i learned more yet from gollum he was loth to
speak and his tale was unclear but it is beyond all doubt that he went to
mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him thus the enemy knows now
that the one is found that it was long in the shire and since his servants
have pursued it almost to our door he soon will know already he may know even
as i speak that we have it here
all sat silent for a while until at length boromir spoke he is a small
thing you say this gollum small but great in mischief what became of him
to what doom did you put him
he is in prison but no worse said aragorn he had suffered much there
is no doubt that he was tormented and the fear of sauron lies black on his
heart still i for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful elves of
mirkwood his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in
one so lean and withered he could work much mischief still if he were free
and i do not doubt that he was allowed to leave mordor on some evil errand
alas alas cried legolas and in his fair elvish face there was great
distress the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told they are not
good but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to this company sméagol
who is now called gollum has escaped
escaped cried aragorn that is ill news indeed we shall all rue it
bitterly i fear how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their trust
not through lack of watchfulness said legolas but perhaps through
over kindliness and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others and that
more is known of our doings than we could wish we guarded this creature day and
night at gandalfs bidding much though we wearied of the task but gandalf
bade us hope still for his cure and we had not the heart to keep him ever in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his old black thoughts
you were less tender to me said glóin with a flash of his eyes as
old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the
elven kings halls
now come said gandalf pray do not interrupt my good glóin that
was a regrettable misunderstanding long set right if all the grievances that
stand between elves and dwarves are to be brought up here we may as well
abandon this council
glóin rose and bowed and legolas continued in the days of fair
weather we led gollum through the woods and there was a high tree standing
alone far from the others which he liked to climb often we let him mount up to
the highest branches until he felt the free wind but we set a guard at the
trees foot one day he refused to come down and the guards had no mind to
climb after him he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as
well as with his hands so they sat by the tree far into the night
it was that very night of summer yet moonless and starless that orcs came
on us at unawares we drove them off after some time they were many and fierce
but they came from over the mountains and were unused to the woods when the
battle was over we found that gollum was gone and his guards were slain or
taken it then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue
and that he knew of it beforehand how that was contrived we cannot guess but
gollum is cunning and the spies of the enemy are many the dark things that
were driven out in the year of the dragons fall have returned in greater
numbers and mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is
maintained
we have failed to recapture gollum we came on his trail among those of many
orcs and it plunged deep into the forest going south but ere long it escaped
our skill and we dared not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to dol
guldur and that is still a very evil place we do not go that way
well well he is gone said gandalf we have no time to seek for him
again he must do what he will but he may play a part yet that neither he nor
sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors other questions what of saruman what are
his counsels to us in this need this tale i must tell in full for only elrond
has heard it yet and that in brief but it will bear on all that we must
resolve it is the last chapter in the tale of the ring so far as it has yet
gone
at the end of june i was in the shire but a cloud of anxiety was on my
mind and i rode to the southern borders of the little land for i had a
foreboding of some danger still hidden from me but drawing near there messages
reached me telling me of war and defeat in gondor and when i heard of the black
shadow a chill smote my heart but i found nothing save a few fugitives from the
south yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not
speak i turned then east and north and journeyed along the greenway and not
far from bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his
grazing horse beside him it was radagast the brown who at one time dwelt at
rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood he is one of my order but i had not
seen him for many a year
 gandalf  he cried i was seeking you but i am a
stranger in these parts all i knew was that you might be found in a wild region
with the uncouth name of shire
 your information was correct i said but do not put it
that way if you meet any of the inhabitants you are near the borders of the
shire now and what do you want with me it must be pressing you were never a
traveller unless driven by great need
 i have an urgent errand he said my news is evil
then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears nazgûl
he whispered the nine are abroad again they have crossed the river
secretly and are moving westward they have taken the guise of riders in
black
i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it
 the enemy must have some great need or purpose said radagast
but what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts i
cannot guess
 what do you mean  said i
 i have been told that wherever they go the riders ask for news of a
land called shire
 the shire i said but my heart sank for even the wise
might fear to withstand the nine when they are gathered together under their
fell chieftain a great king and sorcerer he was of old and now he wields a
deadly fear who told you and who sent you  i asked
 saruman the white answered radagast and he told me to
say that if you feel the need he will help but you must seek his aid at once
or it will be too late
and that message brought me hope for saruman the white is the greatest of
my order radagast is of course a worthy wizard a master of shapes and
changes of hue and he has much lore of herbs and beasts and birds are
especially his friends but saruman has long studied the arts of the enemy
himself and thus we have often been able to forestall him it was by the
devices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur it might be that he had
found some weapons that would drive back the nine
 i will go to saruman i said
 then you must go now said radagast for i have
wasted time in looking for you and the days are running short i was told to
find you before midsummer and that is now here even if you set out from this
spot you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they
seek i myself shall turn back at once and with that he mounted and would
have ridden straight off
 stay a moment  i said we shall need your help and the
help of all things that will give it send out messages to all the beasts and
birds that are your friends tell them to bring news of anything that bears on
this matter to saruman and gandalf let messages be sent to orthanc
 i will do that he said and rode off as if the nine were after
him
i could not follow him then and there i had ridden very far already that
day and i was as weary as my horse and i needed to consider matters i stayed
the night in bree and decided that i had no time to return to the shire never
did i make a greater mistake
however i wrote a message to frodo and trusted to my friend the innkeeper
to send it to him i rode away at dawn and i came at long last to the dwelling
of saruman that is far south in isengard in the end of the misty mountains
not far from the gap of rohan and boromir will tell you that that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the northmost foothills of
ered nimrais the white mountains of his home but isengard is a circle of sheer
rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall and in the midst of that valley is a
tower of stone called orthanc it was not made by saruman but by the men of númenor
long ago and it is very tall and has many secrets yet it looks not to be a
work of craft it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of isengard and
in that circle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a great arch in the wall of rock
and it was strongly guarded but the keepers of the gate were on the watch for
me and told me that saruman awaited me i rode under the arch and the gate
closed silently behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i knew no reason
for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came to the stair of saruman and
there he met me and led me up to his high chamber he wore a ring on his finger
 so you have come gandalf he said to me gravely but in his
eyes there seemed to be a white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
 yes i have come i said i have come for your aid
saruman the white and that title seemed to anger him
 have you indeed gandalf the grey  he scoffed
for aid it has seldom been heard of that gandalf the grey sought for aid
one so cunning and so wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in
every business whether it belongs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered but if i am not deceived said i
things are now moving which will require the union of all our
strength
 that may be so he said but the thought is late in
coming to you how long i wonder have you concealed from me the head of the
council a matter of greatest import what brings you now from your
lurking place in the shire 
 the nine have come forth again i answered they have
crossed the river so radagast said to me
 radagast the brown  laughed saruman and he no longer
concealed his scorn radagast the bird tamer radagast the simple
radagast the fool yet he had just the wit to play the part that i set him for
you have come and that was all the purpose of my message and here you will
stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys for i am saruman the wise
saruman ring maker saruman of many colours 
i looked then and saw that his robes which had seemed white were not so
but were woven of all colours and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
 i liked white better i said
 white  he sneered it serves as a beginning white cloth
may be dyed the white page can be overwritten and the white light can be
broken
 in which case it is no longer white said i and he that
breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom
 you need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for
friends said he i have not brought you hither to be instructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himself up then and began to declaim as if he were making a speech
long rehearsed the elder days are gone the middle days are passing the
younger days are beginning the time of the elves is over but our time is at
hand the world of men which we must rule but we must have power power to
order all things as we will for that good which only the wise can see
 and listen gandalf my old friend and helper  he said coming
near and speaking now in a softer voice i said we for we it may be if
you will join with me a new power is rising against it the old allies and
policies will not avail us at all there is no hope left in elves or dying númenor
this then is one choice before you before us we may join with that power it
would be wise gandalf there is hope that way its victory is at hand and
there will be rich reward for those that aided it as the power grows its
proved friends will also grow and the wise such as you and i may with
patience come at last to direct its courses to control it we can bide our
time we can keep our thoughts in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the
way but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rule order all
the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish hindered rather
than helped by our weak or idle friends there need not be there would not be
any real change in our designs only in our means
 saruman i said i have heard speeches of this kind
before but only in the mouths of emissaries sent from mordor to deceive the
ignorant i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering well i see
that this wise course does not commend itself to you he said not
yet not if some better way can be contrived 
he came and laid his long hand on my arm and why not gandalf 
he whispered why not the ruling ring if we could command that then the
power would pass to us that is in truth why i brought you here for i have many
eyes in my service and i believe that you know where this precious thing now
lies is it not so or why do the nine ask for the shire and what is your
business there  as he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone
suddenly in his eyes
 saruman i said standing away from him only one hand at
a time can wield the one and you know that well so do not trouble to say we
but i would not give it nay i would not give even news of it to you now that
i learn your mind you were head of the council but you have unmasked yourself
at last well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to yourself i
will take neither have you others to offer 
he was cold now and perilous yes he said i did not
expect you to show wisdom even in your own behalf but i gave you the chance of
aiding me willingly and so saving yourself much trouble and pain the third
choice is to stay here until the end
 until what end 
 until you reveal to me where the one may be found i may find means
to persuade you or until it is found in your despite and the ruler has time to
turn to lighter matters to devise say a fitting reward for the hindrance and
insolence of gandalf the grey
 that may not prove to be one of the lighter matters said i he
laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of orthanc in the place
where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars there is no descent save by a
narrow stair of many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away i
looked on it and saw that whereas it had once been green and fair it was now
filled with pits and forges wolves and orcs were housed in isengard for
saruman was mustering a great force on his own account in rivalry of sauron and
not in his service yet over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself
about the sides of orthanc i stood alone on an island in the clouds and i had
no chance of escape and my days were bitter i was pierced with cold and i had
but little room in which to pace to and fro brooding on the coming of the
riders to the north
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart from the words of
saruman which might be lies long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings by
the way that could not be mistaken fear was ever in my heart for my friends in
the shire but still i had some hope i hoped that frodo had set forth at once
as my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell before the deadly
pursuit began and both my fear and my hope proved ill founded for my hope was
founded on a fat man in bree and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer and the power of sauron is
still less than fear makes it but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone
it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen
would falter in the shire far away
i saw you cried frodo you were walking backwards and forwards the moon
shone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him it was only a dream said
frodo but it suddenly came back to me i had quite forgotten it it came some
time ago after i left the shire i think
then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see i was in an
evil plight and those who know me will agree that i have seldom been in such
need and do not bear such misfortune well gandalf the grey caught like a fly
in a spiders treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak
thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also
fallen yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at
our meeting if i had i should never have gone to isengard or i should have
gone more warily so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived
his messenger it would have been useless in any case to try and win over the
honest radagast to treachery he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot for radagast knew no reason why he
should not do as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where he had many
friends of old and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide and they saw
many things the gathering of wolves and the mustering of orcs and the nine
riders going hither and thither in the lands and they heard news of the escape
of gollum and they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me
so it was that when summer waned there came a night of moon and gwaihir
the windlord swiftest of the great eagles came unlooked for to orthanc and he
found me standing on the pinnacle then i spoke to him and he bore me away
before saruman was aware i was far from isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gate to pursue me
 how far can you bear me  i said to gwaihir
 many leagues said he but not to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidings not burdens
 then i must have a steed on land i said and a steed
surpassingly swift for i have never had such need of haste before
 then i will bear you to edoras where the lord of rohan sits in his
halls he said for that is not very far off and i was glad
for in the riddermark of rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there
are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the misty
mountains and the white
 are the men of rohan still to be trusted do you think  i said
to gwaihir for the treason of saruman had shaken my faith
 they pay a tribute of horses he answered and send many
yearly to mordor or so it is said but they are not yet under the yoke but if
saruman has become evil as you say then their doom cannot be long
delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan ere dawn and now i have lengthened my
tale over long the rest must be more brief in rohan i found evil already at
work the lies of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my
warnings he bade me take a horse and be gone and i chose one much to my
liking but little to his i took the best horse in his land and i have never
seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said aragorn and it grieves me more
than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such
tribute it was not so when last i was in that land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir it is a lie that comes from the
enemy i know the men of rohan true and valiant our allies dwelling still in
the lands that we gave them long ago
the shadow of mordor lies on distant lands answered aragorn saruman has
fallen under it rohan is beset who knows what you will find there if ever you
return
not this at least said boromir that they will buy their lives with
horses they love their horses next to their kin and not without reason for
the horses of the riddermark come from the fields of the north far from the
shadow and their race as that of their masters is descended from the free
days of old
true indeed said gandalf and there is one among them that might have
been foaled in the morning of the world the horses of the nine cannot vie with
him tireless swift as the flowing wind shadowfax they called him by day his
coat glistens like silver and by night it is like a shade and he passes
unseen light is his footfall never before had any man mounted him but i took
him and i tamed him and so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire when
frodo was on the barrow downs though i set out from rohan only when he set out
from hobbiton
but fear grew in me as i rode ever as i came north i heard tidings of the
riders and though i gained on them day by day they were ever before me they
had divided their forces i learned some remained on the eastern borders not
far from the greenway and some invaded the shire from the south i came to
hobbiton and frodo had gone but i had words with old gamgee many words and few
to the point he had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of bag
end
 i cant abide changes said he not at my time of life
and least of all changes for the worst changes for the worst
he repeated many times
 worst is a bad word i said to him and i hope you do not
live to see it but amidst his talk i gathered at last that frodo had left
hobbiton less than a week before and that a black horseman had come to the hill
the same evening then i rode on in fear i came to buckland and found it in
uproar as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick i came to
the house at crickhollow and it was broken open and empty but on the threshold
there lay a cloak that had been frodos then for a while hope left me and i
did not wait to gather news or i might have been comforted but i rode on the
trail of the riders it was hard to follow for it went many ways and i was at
a loss but it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards bree and that
way i went for i thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper
 butterbur they call him thought i if this delay was his
fault i will melt all the butter in him i will roast the old fool over a slow
fire he expected no less and when he saw my face he fell down flat and
began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cried frodo in alarm he was really very kind to
us and did all that he could
gandalf laughed dont be afraid he said i did not bite and i barked
very little so overjoyed was i by the news that i got out of him when he
stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow how it happened i could not
then guess but i learned that you had been in bree the night before and had
gone off that morning with strider
 strider  i cried shouting for joy
 yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i could do and they took up with
him they behaved very queer all the time they were here wilful you might
say
 ass fool thrice worthy and beloved barliman  said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer its worth a gold piece at
the least may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence
for seven years  said i now i can take a nights rest the first
since i have forgotten when
so i stayed there that night wondering much what had become of the riders
for only of two had there yet been any news in bree it seemed but in the night
we heard more five at least came from the west and they threw down the gates
and passed through bree like a howling wind and the bree folk are still
shivering and expecting the end of the world i got up before dawn and went
after them
i do not know but it seems clear to me that this is what happened their
captain remained in secret away south of bree while two rode ahead through the
village and four more invaded the shire but when these were foiled in bree and
at crickhollow they returned to their captain with tidings and so left the
road unguarded for a while except by their spies the captain then sent some
eastward straight across country and he himself with the rest rode along the
road in great wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and i reached it before sundown on my
second day from bree and they were there before me they drew away from me for
they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the sun was in
the sky but they closed round at night and i was besieged on the hill top in
the old ring of amon sûl i was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north i could not hope to do
more it was impossible to find you frodo in the wilderness and it would have
been folly to try with all the nine at my heels so i had to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw some of them off and yet reach rivendell ahead of you and
send out help four riders did indeed follow me but they turned back after a
while and made for the ford it seems that helped a little for there were only
five not nine when your camp was attacked
i reached here at last by a long hard road up the hoarwell and through the
ettenmoors and down from the north it took me nearly fourteen days from
weathertop for i could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and
shadowfax departed i sent him back to his master but a great friendship has
grown between us and if i have need he will come at my call but so it was that
i came to rivendell only three days before the ring and news of its peril had
already been brought here which proved well indeed
and that frodo is the end of my account may elrond and the others forgive
the length of it but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf broke
tryst and did not come when he promised an account to the ring bearer of so
strange an event was required i think
well the tale is now told from first to last here we all are and here is
the ring but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose what shall we do
with it
there was silence at last elrond spoke again
this is grievous news concerning saruman he said for we trusted him and
he is deep in all our counsels it is perilous to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill but such falls and betrayals alas have
happened before of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of frodo was
most strange to me i have known few hobbits save bilbo here and it seems to
me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as i had thought him the world
has changed much since i last was on the westward roads
the barrow wights we know by many names and of the old forest many tales
have been told all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern march
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the shire
to dunland west of isengard in those lands i journeyed once and many things
wild and strange i knew but i had forgotten bombadil if indeed this is still
the same that walked the woods and hills long ago and even then was older than
the old that was not then his name iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and
fatherless but many another name he has since been given by other folk forn by
the dwarves orald by northern men and other names beside he is a strange
creature but maybe i should have summoned him to our council
he would not have come said gandalf
could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i should not put it so said gandalf say rather that the ring has no
power over him he is his own master but he cannot alter the ring itself nor
break its power over others and now he is withdrawn into a little land within
bounds that he has set though none can see them waiting perhaps for a change
of days and he will not step beyond them
but within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him said erestor would
he not take the ring and keep it there for ever harmless
no said gandalf not willingly he might do so if all the free folk of
the world begged him but he would not understand the need and if he were given
the ring he would soon forget it or most likely throw it away such things
have no hold on his mind he would be a most unsafe guardian and that alone is
answer enough
but in any case said glorfindel to send the ring to him would only
postpone the day of evil he is far away we could not now take it back to him
unguessed unmarked by any spy and even if we could soon or late the lord of
the rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards
it could that power be defied by bombadil alone i think not i think that in
the end if all else is conquered bombadil will fall last as he was first and
then night will come
i know little of iarwain save the name said galdor but glorfindel i
think is right power to defy our enemy is not in him unless such power is in
the earth itself and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very
hills what power still remains lies with us here in imladris or with cirdan
at the havens or in lórien but have they the strength have we here the
strength to withstand the enemy the coming of sauron at the last when all else
is overthrown
i have not the strength said elrond neither have they
then if the ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength said
glorfindel two things only remain for us to attempt to send it over the sea
or to destroy it
but gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that
we here possess said elrond and they who dwell beyond the sea would not
receive it for good or ill it belongs to middle earth it is for us who still
dwell here to deal with it
then said glorfindel let us cast it into the deeps and so make the lies
of saruman come true for it is clear now that even at the council his feet were
already on a crooked path he knew that the ring was not lost for ever but
wished us to think so for he began to lust for it for himself yet oft in lies
truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
not safe for ever said gandalf there are many things in the deep waters
and seas and lands may change and it is not our part here to take thought only
for a season or for a few lives of men or for a passing age of the world we
should seek a final end of this menace even if we do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the roads to the sea said galdor if the
return to iarwain be thought too dangerous then flight to the s‚a is now
fraught with gravest peril my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to take
the western way when he learns what has befallen he soon will the nine have
been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite ere they find new steeds and
swifter only the waning might of gondor stands now between him and a march in
power along the coasts into the north and if he comes assailing the white
towers and the havens hereafter the elves may have no escape from the
lengthening shadows of middle earth
long yet will that march be delayed said boromir gondor wanes you say
but gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor and
other roads he may find that gondor does not guard
then said erestor there are but two courses as glorfindel already has
declared to hide the ring for ever or to unmake it but both are beyond our
power who will read this riddle for us
none here can do so said elrond gravely at least none can foretell what
will come to pass if we take this road or that but it seems to me now clear
which is the road that we must take the westward road seems easiest therefore
it must be shunned it will be watched too often the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen there lies our
hope if hope it be to walk into peril to mordor we must send the ring to the
fire
silence fell again frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a sunlit
valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirred and frodo looked at him he was fingering his great horn and
frowning at length he spoke
i do not understand all this he said saruman is a traitor but did he
not have a glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying
why should we not think that the great ring has come into our hands to serve us
in the very hour of need wielding it the free lords of the free may surely
defeat the enemy that is what he most fears i deem
the men of gondor are valiant and they will never submit but they may be
beaten down valour needs first strength and then a weapon let the ring be
your weapon if it has such power as you say take it and go forth to victory
alas no said elrond we cannot use the ruling ring that we now know too
well it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil
its strength boromir is too great for anyone to wield at will save only those
who have already a great power of their own but for them it holds an even
deadlier peril the very desire of it corrupts the heart consider saruman if
any of the wise should with this ring overthrow the lord of mordor using his
own arts he would then set himself on saurons throne and yet another dark
lord would appear and that is another reason why the ring should be destroyed
as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the wise for nothing
is evil in the beginning even sauron was not so i fear to take the ring to
hide it i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head so be it he
said then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have and at the
least while the wise ones guard this ring we will fight on mayhap the
sword that was broken may still stem the tide   if the hand that wields it has
inherited not an heirloom only but the sinews of the kings of men
who can tell said aragorn but we will put it to the test one day
may the day not be too long delayed said boromir for though i do not ask
for aid we need it it would comfort us to know that others fought also with
all the means that they have
then be comforted said elrond for there are other powers and realms that
you know not and they are hidden from you anduin the great flows past many
shores ere it comes to argonath and the gates of gondor
still it might be well for all said glóin the dwarf if all these
strengths were joined and the powers of each were used in league other rings
there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need the seven are
lost to us   if balin has not found the ring of thrór which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thrór perished in moria indeed i may
now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no ring in moria said gandalf thrór gave it to
thráin his son but not thráin to thorin it was taken with
torment from thráin in the dungeons of dol guldur i came too late
ah alas cried glóin when will the day come of our revenge but
still there are the three what of the three rings of the elves very mighty
rings it is said do not the elf lords keep them yet they too were made by the
dark lord long ago are they idle i see elf lords here will they not say
the elves returned no answer did you not hear me glóin said
elrond the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch them but of
them it is not permitted to speak so much only in this hour of doubt i may now
say they are not idle but they were not made as weapons of war or conquest
that is not their power those who made them did not desire strength or
domination or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to
preserve all things unstained these things the elves of middle earth have in
some measure gained though with sorrow but all that has been wrought by those
who wield the three will turn to their undoing and their minds and hearts will
become revealed to sauron if he regains the one it would be better if the
three had never been that is his purpose
but what then would happen if the ruling ring were destroyed as you
counsel asked glóin
we know not for certain answered elrond sadly some hope that the three
rings which sauron has never touched would then become free and their rulers
might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought but maybe when the one
has gone the three will fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
that is my belief
yet all the elves are willing to endure this chance said glorfindel if by
it the power of sauron may be broken and the fear of his dominion be taken away
for ever
thus we return once more to the destroying of the ring said erestor and
yet we come no nearer what strength have we for the finding of the fire in
which it was made that is the path of despair of folly i would say if the
long wisdom of elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said gandalf it is not despair for despair is only
for those who see the end beyond all doubt we do not it is wisdom to recognize
necessity when all other courses have been weighed though as folly it may
appear to those who cling to false hope well let folly be our cloak a veil
before the eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and weighs all things to a
nicety in the scales of his malice but the only measure that he knows is
desire desire for power and so he judges all hearts into his heart the
thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having the ring we may seek
to destroy it if we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning
at least for a while said elrond the road must be trod but it will be
very hard and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it this quest
may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong yet such is oft
the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world small hands do them
because they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well very well master elrond said bilbo suddenly say no more it
is plain enough what you are pointing at bilbo the silly hobbit started this
affair and bilbo had better finish it or himself i was very comfortable here
and getting on with my book if you want to know i am just writing an ending
for it i had thought of putting and he lived happily ever afterwards to the
end of his days it is a good ending and none the worse for having been
used before now i shall have to alter that it does not look like coming true
and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters if i live to
write them it is a frightful nuisance when ought i to start
 boromir looked in surprise at bilbo but the laughter died on his lips when
he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect only glóin
smiled but his smile came from old memories
of course my dear bilbo said gandalf if you had really started this
affair you might be expected to finish it but you know well enough now that starting
is too great a claim for any and that only a small part is played in great
deeds by any hero you need not bow though the word was meant and we do not
doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer but one beyond your
strength bilbo you cannot take this thing back it has passed on if you need
my advice any longer i should say that your part is ended unless as a
recorder finish your book and leave the ending unaltered there is still hope
for it but get ready to write a sequel when they come back
bilbo laughed i have never known you give me pleasant advice before he
said as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wonder if this advice is
not bad still i dont suppose i have the strength or luck left to deal with
the ring it has grown and i have not but tell me what do you mean by they
the messengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seems to me what this council has to
decide and all that it has to decide elves may thrive on speech alone and
dwarves endure great weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i miss my meal
at noon cant you think of some names now or put it off till after dinner
no one answered the noon bell rang still no one spoke frodo glanced at all
the faces but they were not turned to him all the council sat with downcast
eyes as if in deep thought a great dread fell on him as if he was awaiting
the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might
after all never be spoken an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace
by bilbos side in rivendell filled all his heart at last with an effort he
spoke and wondered to hear his own words as if some other will was using his
small voice
i will take the ring he said though i do not know the way
elrond raised his eyes and looked at him and frodo felt his heart pierced by
the sudden keenness of the glance if i understand aright all that i have
heard he said i think that this task is appointed for you frodo and that
if you do not find a way no one will this is the hour of the shire folk when
they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the
great who of all the wise could have foreseen it or if they are wise why
should they expect to know it until the hour has struck
but it is a heavy burden so heavy that none could lay it on another i do
not lay it on you but if you take it freely i will say that your choice is
right and though all the mighty elf friends of old hador and húrin
and túrin and beren himself were assembled together your seat should be
among them
but you wont send him off alone surely master cried sam unable to
contain himself any longer and jumping up from the corner where he had been
quietly sitting on the floor
no indeed said elrond turning towards him with a smile you at least
shall go with him it is hardly possible to separate you from him even when he
is summoned to a secret council and you are not
sam sat down blushing and muttering a nice pickle we have landed ourselves
in mr frodo he said shaking his head
 
later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbos room merry
and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam had crept into the council
and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfair said pippin instead of throwing him out and clapping
him in chains elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek
rewards said frodo i cant imagine a more severe punishment you are not
thinking what you are saying condemned to go on this hopeless journey a
reward yesterday i dreamed that my task was done and i could rest here a long
while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could but we are envying sam
not you if you have to go then it will be a punishment for any of us to be
left behind even in rivendell we have come a long way with you and been
through some stiff times we want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin we hobbits ought to stick together and
we will i shall go unless they chain me up there must be someone with
intelligence in the party
then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took said gandalf looking
in through the window which was near the ground but you are all worrying
yourselves unnecessarily nothing is decided yet
nothing decided cried pippin then what were you all doing you were shut
up for hours
talking said bilbo there was a deal of talk and everyone had an
eye opener even old gandalf i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught
even him on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrong said gandalf you were inattentive i had already heard of
it from gwaihir if you want to know the only real eye openers as you put it
were you and frodo and i was the only one that was not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo
and sam i was afraid all the time that it might come to that if i was let off
but if you ask me elrond will send out a fair number when the reports come in
have they started yet gandalf
yes said the wizard some of the scouts have been sent out already more
will go tomorrow elrond is sending elves and they will get in touch with the
rangers and maybe with thranduils folk in mirkwood and aragorn has gone with
elronds sons we shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues
before any move is made so cheer up frodo you will probably make quite a long
stay here
ah said sam gloomily well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped said bilbo its your fault partly frodo my lad
insisting on waiting for my birthday a funny way of honouring it i cant help
thinking not the day i should have chosen for letting the s bs into bag end
but there it is you cant wait now fill spring and you cant go till the
reports come back
when winter first begins to bite

and stones crack in the frosty night

when pools are black and trees are bare

tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will said gandalf we cant start until we have found out
about the riders
i thought they were all destroyed in the flood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf the power of their
master is in them and they stand or fall by him we hope that they were all
unhorsed and unmasked and so made for a while less dangerous but we must find
out for certain in the meantime you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to help you but i will whisper this in your
ears someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party he was right
i think i shall come with you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement that gandalf left the
window sill where he had been sitting and took off his hat and bowed i only
said i think i shall come do not count on anything yet in this matter
elrond will have much to say and your friend the strider which reminds me i
want to see elrond i must be off
how long do you think i shall have here said frodo to bilbo when gandalf
had gone
oh i dont know i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo but quite
long i should think we can have many a good talk what about helping me with
my book and making a start on the next have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo books ought to have good endings how would
this do and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after
it will do well if it ever comes to that said frodo
ah said sam and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and
of the perils that lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land of rivendell
that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds the future good or
ill was not forgotten but ceased to have any power over the present health
and hope grew strong in them and they were content with each good day as it
came taking pleasure in every meal and in every word and song
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright and fair and each
evening followed cool and clear but autumn was waning fast slowly the golden
light faded to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the east the hunters
moon waxed round in the night sky and put to flight all the lesser stars but
low in the south one star shone red every night as the moon waned again it
shone brighter and brighter frodo could see it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of
the valley
the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of elrond and november
had gone by with the last shreds of autumn and december was passing when the
scouts began to return some had gone north beyond the springs of the hoarwell
into the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with the help of aragorn and
the rangers had searched the lands far down the greyflood as far as tharbad
where the old north road crossed the river by a ruined town many had gone east
and south and some of these had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood
while others had climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river and had
come down into wilderland and over the gladden fields and so at length had
reached the old home of radagast at rhosgobel radagast was not there and they
had returned over the high pass that was called the dimrill stair the sons of
elrond elladan and elrohir were the last to return they had made a great
journey passing down the silverlode into a strange country but of their errand
they would not speak to any save to elrond
in no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the riders
or other servants of the enemy even from the eagles of the misty mountains they
had learned no fresh news nothing had been seen or heard of gollum but the
wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded ford on
the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more
and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered of the black riders no other
trace was to be seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt it seemed that
they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf it is rash
to be too sure yet i think that we may hope now that the ringwraiths were
scattered and have been obliged to return as best they could to their master in
mordor empty and shapeless
if that is so it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again of
course the enemy has other servants but they will have to journey all the way
to the borders of rivendell before they can pick up our trail and if we are
careful that will be hard to find but we must delay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him he looked gravely at frodo the time has
come he said if the ring is to set out it must go soon but those who go
with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force they must
pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid do you still hold to your word
frodo that you will be the ring bearer
i do said frodo i will go with sam
then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elrond i can
foresee very little of your road and how your task is to be achieved i do not
know the shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains and draws nigh even
to the borders of greyflood and under the shadow all is dark to me you will
meet many foes some open and some disguised and you may find friends upon
your way when you least look for it i will send out messages such as i can
contrive to those whom i know in the wide world but so perilous are the lands
now become that some may well miscarry or come no quicker than you yourself
and i will choose you companions to go with you as far as they will or
fortune allows the number must be few since your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the elder days it would avail little save
to arouse the power of mordor
the company of the ring shall be nine and the nine walkers shall be set
against the nine riders that are evil with you and your faithful servant
gandalf will go for this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his
labours
for the rest they shall represent the other free peoples of the world
elves dwarves and men legolas shall be for the elves and gimli son of glóin
for the dwarves they are willing to go at least to the passes of the mountains
and maybe beyond for men you shall have aragorn son of arathorn for the ring
of isildur concerns him closely
strider said frodo
yes he said with a smile i ask leave once again to be your companion
frodo
i would have begged you to come said frodo only i thought you were going
to minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragorn and the sword that was broken shall be reforged ere i
set out to war but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of
miles therefore boromir will also be in the company he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond these i will
consider of my household i may find some that it seems good to me to send
but that will leave no place for us cried pippin in dismay we dont want
to be left behind we want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead
said elrond
neither does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supporting pippin nor do
any of us see clearly it is true that if these hobbits understood the danger
they would not dare to go but they would still wish to go or wish that they
dared and be shamed and unhappy i think elrond that in this matter it would
be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom even if you
chose for us an elf lord such as glorfindel he could not storm the dark tower
nor open the road to the fire by the power that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt the shire i forebode
is not free now from peril and these two i had thought to send back there as
messengers to do what they could according to the fashion of their country to
warn the people of their danger in any case i judge that the younger of these
two peregrin took should remain my heart is against his going
then master elrond you will have to lock me in prison or send me home
tied in a sack said pippin for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then you shall go said elrond and he sighed now the tale
of nine is filled in seven days the company must depart
the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish smiths and on its blade was
traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent moon and the rayed sun
and about them was written many runes for aragorn son of arathorn was going to
war upon the marches of mordor very bright was that sword when it was made
whole again the light of the sun shone redly in it and the light of the moon
shone cold and its edge was hard and keen and aragorn gave it a new name and
called it andúril flame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the
perils they would meet and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books
of lore that were in the house of elrond sometimes frodo was with them but he
was content to lean on their guidance and he spent as much time as he could
with bilbo
in those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the hall of
fire and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of beren and lúthien
and the winning of the great jewel but in the day while merry and pippin were
out and about frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo in his own small room
then bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very
incomplete or scraps of his verses or would take notes of frodos adventures
on the morning of the last day frodo was alone with bilbo and the old hobbit
pulled out from under his bed a wooden box he lifted the lid and fumbled
inside
here is your sword he said but it was broken you know i took it to
keep it safe but ive forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it no time
now so i thought perhaps you would care to have this dont you know
he took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard then
he drew it and its polished and well tended blade glittered suddenly cold and
bright this is sting he said and thrust it with little effort deep into a
wooden beam take it if you like i shant want it again i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also there is this said bilbo bringing out a parcel which seemed to be
rather heavy for its size he unwound several folds of old cloth and held up a
small shirt of mail it was close woven of many rings as supple almost as
linen cold as ice and harder than steel it shone like moonlit silver and was
studded with white gems with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in the light and
useful it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me i got it back from michel
delving before i started and packed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me except the ring but i did not expect to
use this and i dont need it now except to look at sometimes you hardly feel
any weight when you put it on
i should look   well i dont think i should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo but never mind about looks you can
wear it under your outer clothes come on you must share this secret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happier if i knew you were wearing
it i have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the black riders he ended
in a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo bilbo put it on him and fastened
sting upon the glittering belt and then frodo put over the top his old
weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit you look said bilbo but there is more about you now
than appears on the surface good luck to you he turned away and looked out of
the window trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank you as i should bilbo for this and for all our past
kindnesses said frodo
dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the back
ow he cried you are too hard now to slap but there you are hobbits must
stick together and especially bagginses all i ask in return is take as much
care of yourself as you can and bring back all the news you can and any old
songs and tales you can come by ill do my best to finish my book before you
return i should like to write the second book if i am spared he broke off
and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and think

of all that i have seen

of meadow flowers and butterflies

in summers that have been



of yellow leaves and gossamer

in autumns that there were

with morning mist and silver sun

and wind upon my hair



i sit beside the fire and think

of how the world will be

when winter comes without a spring

that i shall ever see



for still there are so many things

that i have never seen

in every wood in every spring

there is a different green



i sit beside the fire and think

of people long ago

and people who will see a world

that i shall never know



but all the while i sit and think

of times there were before

i listen for returning feet

and voices at the door
it was a cold grey day near the end of december the east wind was streaming
through the bare branches of the trees and seething in the dark pines on the
hills ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low as the cheerless
shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them to journey under cover of
night as often as they could until they were far from rivendell
you should fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron he said i do not
doubt that news of the discomfiture of the riders has already reached him and
he will be filled with wrath soon now his spies on foot and wing will be abroad
in the northern lands even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your
way
the company took little gear of war for their hope was in secrecy not in
battle aragorn had andúril but no other weapon and he went forth clad
only in rusty green and brown as a ranger of the wilderness boromir had a long
sword in fashion like andúril but of less lineage and he bore also a
shield and his war horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills he said and then
let all the foes of gondor flee putting it to his lips he blew a blast and
the echoes leapt from rock to rock and all that heard that voice in rivendell
sprang to their feet
slow should you be to wind that horn again boromir said elrond until you
stand once more on the borders of your land and dire need is on you
maybe said boromir but always i have let my horn cry at setting forth
and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows i will not go forth as a thief
in the night
gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel rings for dwarves
make light of burdens and in his belt was a broad bladed axe legolas had a bow
and a quiver and at his belt a long white knife the younger hobbits wore the
swords that they had taken from the barrow but frodo took only sting and his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden gandalf bore his staff but girt at
his side was the elven sword glamdring the mate of orcrist that lay now upon
the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain
all were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clothes and they had
jackets and cloaks lined with fur spare food and clothes and blankets and other
needs were laden on a pony none other than the poor beast that they had brought
from bree
he stay in rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him he was
glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth it was sam who had insisted on
choosing him declaring that bill as he called him would pine if he did not
come
that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk if he stayed here
much longer he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin could speak it if you
dont let me go with you sam ill follow on my own so bill was going as the
beast of burden yet he was the only member of the company that did not seem
depressed
their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire and they were
only waiting now for gandalf who had not yet come out of the house a gleam of
firelight came from the open doors and soft lights were glowing in many
windows bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only elrond knew fully what this
hour meant to him the others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness
sam was standing by the pony sucking his teeth and staring moodily into the
gloom where the river roared stonily below his desire for adventure was at its
lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us you could
have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes bill swished his
tail and said nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over anxiously in his mind all
the things that he had stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his
chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box of salt that he always
carried and refilled when he could a good supply of pipe weed but not near
enough ill warrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen various small
belongings of his masters that frodo had forgotten and sam had stowed to bring
them out in triumph when they were called for he went through them all
rope he muttered no rope and only last night you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it if you havent got
it well ill want it i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out with gandalf and he called the company to
him this is my last word he said in a low voice the ring bearer is setting
out on the quest of mount doom on him alone is any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy nor indeed to let
any handle it save members of the company and the council and only then in
gravest need the others go with him as free companions to help him on his way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into other paths as chance allows
the further you go the less easy will it be to withdraw yet no oath or bond is
laid on you to go further than you will for you do not yet know the strength of
your hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but let him not vow to walk in the dark who has not
seen the nightfall
yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart said gimli
or break it said elrond look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts farewell and may the blessing of elves and men and all free folk go
with you may the stars shine upon your faces
good    good luck cried bilbo stuttering with the cold i dont
suppose you will be able to keep a diary frodo my lad but i shall expect a
full account when you get back and dont be too long farewell
many others of elronds household stood in the shadows and watched them go
bidding them farewell with soft voices there was no laughter and no song or
music at last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out
of the cloven vale of rivendell and they came at length to the high moor where
the wind hissed through the heather then with one glance at the last homely
house twinkling below them they strode away far into the night
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and turning southwards went on by
narrow paths among the folded lands their purpose was to hold this course west
of the mountains for many miles and days the country was much rougher and more
barren than in the green vale of the great river in wilderland on the other side
of the range and their going would be slow but they hoped in this way to
escape the notice of unfriendly eyes the spies of sauron had hitherto seldom
been seen in this empty country and the paths were little known except to the
people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who knew this land even
in the dark the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes were keen
was the rearguard the first part of their journey was hard and dreary and
frodo remembered little of it save the wind for many sunless days an icy blast
came from the mountains in the east and no garment seemed able to keep out its
searching fingers though the company was well clad they seldom felt warm
either moving or at rest they slept uneasily during the middle of the day in
some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled thorn bushes that grew in
thickets in many places in the late afternoon they were roused by the watch
and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a rule for they could seldom
risk the lighting of a fire in the evening they went on again always as nearly
southward as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled
until they were weary they were creeping forward like snails and getting
nowhere each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before yet
steadily the mountains were drawing nearer south of rivendell they rose ever
higher and bent westwards and about the feet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep valleys filled with
turbulent waters paths were few and winding and led them often only to the
edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed the wind
suddenly fell and then veered round to the south the swift flowing clouds
lifted and melted away and the sun came out pale and bright there came a cold
clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night march the travellers reached a
low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees whose grey green trunks seemed to
have been built out of the very stone of the hills their dark leaves shone and
their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that
seemed now to stand across the path that the company was taking at the left of
this high range rose three peaks the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth
tipped with snow its great bare northern precipice was still largely in the
shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and looked out under his hand we have done
well he said we have reached the borders of the country that men call
hollin many elves lived here in happier days when eregion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow flies we have come though many long miles
further our feet have walked the land and the weather will be milder now but
perhaps all the more dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty welcome said frodo throwing
back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face
but the mountains are ahead of us said pippin we must have turned
eastwards in the night
no said gandalf but you see further ahead in the clear light beyond
those peaks the range bends round south west there are many maps in elronds
house but i suppose you never thought to look at them
yes i did sometimes said pippin but i dont remember them frodo has a
better head for that sort of thing
i need no map said gimli who had come up with legolas and was gazing out
before him with a strange light in his deep eyes there is the land where our
fathers worked of old and we have wrought the image of those mountains into
many works of metal and of stone and into many songs and tales they stand tall
in our dreams baraz zirak shathûr
only once before have i seen them from afar in waking life but i know them
and their names for under them lies khazad dûm the dwarrowdelf that is
now called the black pit moria in the elvish tongue yonder stands barazinbar
the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him are silvertine and cloudyhead
celebdil the white and fanuidhol the grey that we call zirak zigil and
bundushathûr
there the misty mountains divide and between their arms lies the
deep shadowed valley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrill dale
which the elves call nanduhirion
it is for the dimrill dale that we are making said gandalf if we climb
the pass that is called the redhorn gate under the far side of caradhras we
shall come down by the dimrill stair into the deep vale of the dwarves there
lies the mirrormere and there the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled zâram said gimli and cold are the
springs of kibil nâla my heart trembles at the thought that i may see
them soon
may you have joy of the sight my good dwarf l said gandalf but whatever
you may do we at least cannot stay in that valley we must go down the
silverlode into the secret woods and so to the great river and then  
he paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the journey   in the end said gandalf we cannot look too
far ahead let us be glad that the first stage is safely over i think we will
rest here not only today but tonight as well there is a wholesome air about
hollin much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the elves if
once they dwelt there
that is true said legolas but the elves of this land were of a race
strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees and the grass do not now
remember them only i hear the stones lament them deep they delved us fair
they wrought us high they builded us but they are gone they are gone
they sought the havens long ago
that morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of
holly and their supper breakfast was merrier than it had been since they set
out they did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expected to have all the
night to sleep in and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the
next day only aragorn was silent and restless after a while he left the
company and wandered on to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of a tree
looking out southwards and westwards with his head posed as if he was
listening then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the
others laughing and talking
what is the matter strider merry called up what are you looking for do
you miss the east wind
no indeed he answered but i miss something i have been in the country
of hollin in many seasons no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at all times especially birds yet now all things but you are silent i
can feel it there is no sound for miles about us and your voices seem to make
the ground echo i do not understand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interest but what do you guess is the
reason he asked is there more in it than surprise at seeing four hobbits
not to mention the rest of us where people are so seldom seen or heard
i hope that is it answered aragorn but i have a sense of watchfulness
and of fear that i have never had here before
then we must be more careful said gandalf if you bring a ranger
with you it is well to pay attention to him especially if the ranger is
aragorn we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the first watch but aragorn joined him
the others fell asleep then the silence grew until even sam felt it the
breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard the swish of the ponys tail
and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises sam could hear his
own joints creaking if he stirred dead silence was around him and over all
hung a clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the east away in the south a
dark patch appeared and grew and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strider it dont look like a cloud said sam in a whisper to
aragorn he made no answer he was gazing intently at the sky but before long
sam could see for himself what was approaching flocks of birds flying at great
speed were wheeling and circling and traversing all the land as if they were
searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer
lie flat and still hissed aragorn pulling sam down into the shade of a
holly bush for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main
host and came flying low straight towards the ridge sam thought they were a
kind of crow of large size as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that
their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was
heard
not until they had dwindled into the distance north and west and the sky
was again clear would aragorn rise then he sprang up and went and wakened
gandalf
regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the mountains
and the greyflood he said and they have passed over hollin they are not
natives here they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland i do not know
what they are about possibly there is some trouble away south from which they
are fleeing but i think they are spying out the land i have also glimpsed many
hawks flying high up in the sky i think we ought to move again this evening
hollin is no longer wholesome for us it is being watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gate said gandalf and how we can get
over that without being seen i cannot imagine but we will think of that when
we must as for moving as soon as it is dark i am afraid that you are right
luckily our fire made little smoke and had burned low before the crebain
came said aragorn it must be put out and not lit again
well if that isnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin the news no fire
and a move again by night had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the
late afternoon all because of a pack of crows i had looked forward to a real
good meal tonight something hot
well you can go on looking forward said gandalf there may be many
unexpected feasts ahead for you for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in
comfort and warmer feet however we are certain of one thing at any rate it
will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo but im beginning to
think its time we got a sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of the
road so to speak i thought at first that this here redhorn or whatever its
name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece a fair jaw cracker
dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing to sams mind and all distances
in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning
all that day the company remained in hiding the dark birds passed over now
and again but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards at
dusk the company set out and turning now half east they steered their course
towards caradhras which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of
the vanished sun one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path it looked to frodo like the
remains of an ancient road that had once been broad and well planned from
hollin to the mountain pass the moon now at the full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black many of them
looked to have been worked by hands though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in
a bleak barren land
it was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn and the moon was
low frodo looked up at the sky suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again he
shivered
did you see anything pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just
ahead
no but i felt it whatever it was he answered it may be nothing only a
wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then muttered aragorn and not with the wind
nothing further happened that night the next morning dawned even brighter
than before but the air was chill again already the wind was turning back
towards the east for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but
ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills and the mountains
towered up nearer and nearer on the third morning caradhras rose before them
a mighty peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked sides dull
red as if stained with blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan the wind had gone now
round to the north east gandalf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behind us he said quietly to aragorn the heights away
north are whiter than they were snow is lying far down their shoulders tonight
we shall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate we may well be seen by
watchers on that narrow path and waylaid by some evil but the weather may
prove a more deadly enemy than any what do you think of your course now
aragorn
frodo overheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that had begun long before he listened anxiously
i think no good of our course from beginning to end as you know well
gandalf answered aragorn and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
but we must go on and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no passes till one comes to the gap of rohan i do not
trust that way since your news of saruman who knows which side now the marshals
of the horse lords serve
who knows indeed said gandalf but there is another way and not by the
pass of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it again not yet say nothing to the others i beg
not until it is plain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go further answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while the others rest and sleep
said aragorn
in the late afternoon while the others were finishing their breakfast
gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras its
sides were now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud frodo watched
them wondering which way the debate would go when they returned to the company
gandalf spoke and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and
the high pass he was relieved he could not guess what was the other dark and
secret way but the very mention of it had seemed to fill aragorn with dismay
and frodo was glad that it had been abandoned
from signs that we have seen lately said gandalf i fear that the redhorn
gate may be watched and also i have doubts of the weather that is coming up
behind snow may come we must go with all the speed that we can even so it
will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass dark
will come early this evening we must leave as soon as you can get ready
i will add a word of advice if i may said boromir i was born under the
shadow of the white mountains and know something of journeys in the high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we come down on the other side
it will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death when we leave
here where there are still a few trees and bushes each of us should carry a
faggot of wood as large as he can bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam the pony looked
at him mournfully
very well said gandalf but we must not use the wood   not unless it is a
choice between fire and death
the company set out again with good speed at first but soon their way became
steep and difficult the twisting and climbing road had in many places almost
disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones the night grew deadly dark
under great clouds a bitter wind swirled among the rocks by midnight they had
climbed to the knees of the great mountains the narrow path now wound under a
sheer wall of cliffs to the left above which the grim flanks of caradhras
towered up invisible in the gloom on the right was a gulf of darkness where the
land fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face he put out his arm and saw the dim white
flakes of snow settling on his sleeve
they went on but before long the snow was falling fast filling all the air
and swirling into frodos eyes the dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only
a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like this at all panted sam just behind snows all right on a
fine morning but i like to be in bed while its falling i wish this lot would
go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there except on the high moors of
the northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the shire and was regarded as a
pleasant event and a chance for fun no living hobbit save bilbo could
remember the fell winter of 1311 when the white wolves invaded the shire over
the frozen brandywine
gandalf halted snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was already
ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he said what do you say now aragorn
that i feared it too aragorn answered but less than other things i knew
the risk of snow though it seldom falls heavily so far south save high up in
the mountains but we are not high yet we are still far down where the paths
are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy said boromir they
say in my land that he can govern the storms in the mountains of shadow that
stand upon the borders of mordor he has strange powers and many allies
his arm has grown long indeed said gimli if he can draw snow down from
the north to trouble us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the snow slackened until it
almost ceased they tramped on again but they had not gone more than a furlong
when the storm returned with fresh fury the wind whistled and the snow became a
blinding blizzard soon even boromir found it hard to keep going the hobbits
bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller folk but it was plain that
they could not go much further if the snow continued frodos feet felt like
lead pippin was dragging behind even gimli as stout as any dwarf could be
was grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come to an agreement without any
words being spoken they heard eerie noises in the darkness round them it may
have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall
but the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter stones
began to fall from the mountain side whistling over their heads or crashing on
the path beside them every now and again they heard a dull rumble as a great
boulder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir let those call it the wind who
will there are fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said aragorn but that does not make what you say
untrue there are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little
love for those that go on two legs and yet are not in league with sauron but
have purposes of their own some have been in this world longer than he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill name said gimli long years
ago when rumour of sauron had not been heard in these lands
it matters little who is the enemy if we cannot beat off his attack said
gandalf
but what can we do cried pippin miserably he was leaning on merry and
frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we are or go back said gandalf it is no good going
on only a little higher if i remember rightly this path leaves the cliff and
runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope we should
have no shelter there from snow or stones   or anything else
and it is no good going back while the storm holds said aragorn we have
passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff wall we
are under now
shelter muttered sam if this is shelter then one wall and no roof make
a house
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could it
faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out a little so that they hoped
it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling
stones but eddying blasts swirled round them from every side and the snow
flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled together with their backs to the wall bill the pony stood
patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits and screened them a little
but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely
buried
a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt himself sinking fast into a warm
and hazy dream he thought a fire was heating his toes and out of the shadows
on the other side of the hearth he heard bilbos voice speaking i dont
think much of your diary he said snowstorms on january the twelfth
there was no need to come back to report that
but i wanted rest and sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when
he felt himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness boromir had
lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said boromir it is
useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads we must do something to
save ourselves
give them this said gandalf searching in his pack and drawing out a
leathern flask just a mouthful each   for all of us it is very precious it
is miruvor the cordial of imladris elrond gave it to me at our parting
pass it round
as soon as frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he
felt a new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs the
others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour but the snow did not
relent it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly the choice seems near now
between fire and death gandalf doubtless we shall be hidden from all
unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make a fire if you can answered gandalf if there are any
watchers that can endure this storm then they can see us fire or no but
though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of boromir it passed
the skill of elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the
swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel at last reluctantly gandalf himself took
a hand picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment and then with a word
of command naur an edraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff into
the midst of it at once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out and
the wood flared and sputtered
if there are any to see then i at least am revealed to them he said i
have written gandalf is here in signs that all can read from rivendell to
the mouths of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes their hearts
were rejoiced to see the light of the fire the wood burned merrily and though
all round it the snow hissed and pools of slush crept under their feet they
warmed their hands gladly at the blaze there they stood stooping in a circle
round the little dancing and blowing flames a red light was on their tired and
anxious faces behind them the night was like a black wall
but the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell
the fire burned low and the last faggot was thrown on
the night is getting old said aragorn the dawn is not far off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness the snow
is growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be
revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire but for a long time
he could see no sign of their slackening then suddenly as sleep was beginning
to creep over him again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen and the
flakes were becoming larger and fewer very slowly a dim light began to grow at
last the snow stopped altogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world below their
refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path
that they had trodden was altogether lost but the heights above were hidden in
great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow
gimli looked up and shook his head caradhras has not forgiven us he said
he has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on the sooner we go back and
down the better
to this all agreed but their retreat was now difficult it might well prove
impossible only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet
deep higher than the heads of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and
piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff
if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame he might melt a path for
you said legolas the storm had troubled him little and he alone of the
company remained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the sun to save us
answered gandalf but i must have something to work on i cannot burn snow
well said boromir when heads are at a loss bodies must serve as we say
in my country the strongest of us must seek a way see though all is now
snow clad our path as we came up turned about that shoulder of rock down
yonder it was there that the snow first began to burden us if we could reach
that point maybe it would prove easier beyond it is no more than a furlong
off i guess
then let us force a path thither you and i said aragorn
aragorn was the tallest of the company but boromir little less in height
was broader and heavier in build he led the way and aragorn followed him
slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily in places the snow was
breast high and often boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great
arms rather than walking
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips and then he
turned to the others the strongest must seek a way say you but i say let a
ploughman plough but choose an otter for swimming and for running light over
grass and leaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo noticed as if for the first
time though he had long known it that the elf had no boots but wore only
light shoes as he always did and his feet made little imprint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking the toiling men with
a wave of his hand he passed them and sped into the distance and vanished
round the rocky turn
the others waited huddled together watching until boromir and aragorn
dwindled into black specks in the whiteness at length they too passed from
sight the time dragged on the clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow
came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer and then at last they
saw legolas coming back at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round
the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope
well cried legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun she is
walking in the blue fields of the south and a little wreath of snow on this
redhorn hillock troubles her not at all but i have brought back a gleam of good
hope for those who are doomed to go on feet there is the greatest wind drift of
all just beyond the turn and there our strong men were almost buried they
despaired until i returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a
wall and on the other side the snow suddenly grows less while further down it
is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli it was no ordinary storm it is the
ill will of caradhras he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift was
laid to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have men with you said
boromir who came up at that moment and doughty men too if i may say it
though lesser men with spades might have served you better still we have
thrust a lane through the drift and for that all here may be grateful who
cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get down there even if you have cut through the drift
said pippin voicing the thought of all the hobbits
have hope said boromir i am weary but i still have some strength left
and aragorn too we will bear the little folk the others no doubt will make
shift to tread the path behind us come master peregrin i will begin with
you
he lifted up the hobbit cling to my back i shall need my arms he said and
strode forward aragorn with merry came behind pippin marvelled at his
strength seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than
his great limbs even now burdened as he was he was widening the track for
those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came at length to the great drift it was flung across the mountain path
like a sheer and sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with knives
reared up more than twice the height of boromir but through the middle a
passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge on the far side merry
and pippin were set down and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the
company to arrive
after a while boromir returned carrying sam behind in the narrow but now
well trodden track came gandalf leading bill with gimli perched among the
baggage last came aragorn carrying frodo they passed through the lane but
hardly had frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a
fall of stones and slithering snow the spray of it half blinded the company as
they crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again they saw that
the path was blocked behind them
enough enough cried gimli we are departing as quickly as we may and
indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended
as if caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would
not dare to return the threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break and the
light grew broader
as legolas had reported they found that the snow became steadily more
shallow as they went down so that even the hobbits could trudge along soon
they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where
they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the morning was now far advanced from the high place they looked back
westwards over the lower lands far away in the tumble of country that lay at
the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the
pass
frodos legs ached he was chilled to the bone and hungry and his head was
dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill black specks swam
before his eyes he rubbed them but the black specks remained in the distance
below him but still high above the lower foothills dark dots were circling in
the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf whether they are good or evil or
have nothing to do with us at all we must go down at once not even on the
knees of caradhras will we wait for another night fall
a cold wind flowed down behind them as they turned their backs on the
redhorn gate and stumbled wearily down the slope caradhras had defeated them
 
it was evening and the grey light was again waning fast when they halted
for the night they were very weary the mountains were veiled in deepening
dusk and the wind was cold gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the
miruvor of rivendell when they had eaten some food he called a council
we cannot of course go on again tonight he said the attack on the
redhorn gate has tired us out and we must rest here for a while
and then where are we to go  asked frodo
we still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandalf we
have no choice but to go on or to return to rivendell
pippins face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to rivendell
merry and sam looked up hopefully but aragorn and boromir made no sign frodo
looked troubled
i wish i was back there he said but how can i return without shame  
unless there is indeed no other way and we are already defeated 
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back is to admit defeat and face
worse defeat to come if we go back now then the ring must remain there we
shall not be able to set out again then sooner or later rivendell will be
besieged and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed the
ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows yet of the power and
terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their masters hand again
then we must go on if there is a way said frodo with a sigh sam sank
back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf i thought from the
beginning when first i considered this journey that we should try it but it
is not a pleasant way and i have not spoken of it to the company before
aragorn was against it until the pass over the mountains had at least been
tried
if it is a worse road than the redhorn gate then it must be evil indeed
said merry but you had better tell us about it and let us know the worst at
once
the road that i speak of leads to the mines of moria said gandalf only
gimli lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyes on all the others
a dread fell at the mention of that name even to the hobbits it was a legend of
vague fear
the road may lead to moria but how can we hope that it will lead through
moria  said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir nor do i see the need to go there
if we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southwards until we come to
the gap of rohan where men are friendly to my people taking the road that i
followed on my way hither or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the regions nigh to the
sea
things have changed since you came north boromir answered gandalf did
you not hear what i told you of saruman with him i may have business of my own
ere all is over but the ring must not come near isengard if that can by any
means be prevented the gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the
bearer
as for the longer road we cannot afford the time we might spend a year in
such a journey and we should pass through many lands that are empty and
harbourless yet they would not be safe the watchful eyes both of saruman and
of the enemy are on them when you came north boromir you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a matter of small concern to
him his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ring but you return now as a
member of the rings company and you are in peril as long as you remain with
us the danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked
sky
since our open attempt on the mountain pass our plight has become more
desperate i fear i see now little hope if we do not soon vanish from sight
for a while and cover our trail therefore i advise that we should go neither
over the mountains nor round them but under them that is a road at any rate
that the enemy will least expect us to take
we do not know what he expects said boromir he may watch all roads
likely and unlikely in that case to enter moria would be to walk into a trap
hardly better than knocking at the gates of the dark tower itself the name of
moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when you liken moria to the stronghold of
sauron answered gandalf i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the
dark lord and only in his older and lesser dwelling in dol guldur those who
pass the gates of barad dûr do not return but i would not lead you into
moria if there were no hope of coming out again if there are orcs there it may
prove ill for us that is true but most of the orcs of the misty mountains were
scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies the eagles report that orcs
are gathering again from afar but there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and that in some deep hall of
his fathers balin son of fundin may be found however it may prove one must
tread the path that need chooses
i will tread the path with you gandalf  said gimli i will go and look
on the halls of durin whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that
are shut
good gimli  said gandalf you encourage me we will seek the hidden
doors together and we will come through in the ruins of the dwarves a dwarfs
head will be less easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits yet it will not
be the first time that i have been to moria i sought there long for thráin
son of thrór after he was lost i passed through and i came out again
alive 
i too once passed the dimrill gate said aragorn quietly but though i
also came out again the memory is very evil i do not wish to enter moria a
second time
and i dont wish to enter it even once said pippin
nor me muttered sam
of course not  said gandalf who would but the question is who will
follow me if i lead you there 
i will said gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn heavily you followed my lead almost to disaster in
the snow and have said no word of blame i will follow your lead now   if this
last warning does not move you it is not of the ring nor of us others that i
am thinking now but of you gandalf and i say to you if you pass the doors of
moria beware 
i will not go said boromir not unless the vote of the whole
company is against me what do legolas and the little folk say the
ring bearers voice surely should be heard 
i do not wish to go to moria said legolas
the hobbits said nothing sam looked at frodo at last frodo spoke i do not
wish to go he said but neither do i wish to refuse the advice of gandalf i
beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it gandalf will get
votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom how the wind
howls 
at these words all fell into silent thought they heard the wind hissing
among the rocks and trees and there was a howling and wailing round them in the
empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet how the wind howls  he cried it is
howling with wolf voices the wargs have come west of the mountains 
need we wait until morning then  said gandalf it is as i said the hunt
is up even if we live to see the dawn who now will wish to journey south by
night with the wild wolves on his trail 
how far is moria  asked boromir
there was a door south west of caradhras some fifteen miles as the crow
flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimly
then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow if we can said boromir
the wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears
true said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath but where the warg
howls there also the orc prowls
i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam i am no good
after all there is not enough of the breed of bandobras the bullroarer in me
these howls freeze my blood i dont ever remember feeling so wretched
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam but we arent
etten yet and there are some stout folk here with us whatever may be in store
for old gandalf ill wager it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the company climbed to the top of the small
hill under which they had been sheltering it was crowned with a knot of old and
twisted trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones in the midst
of this they lit a fire for there was no hope that darkness and silence would
keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood the howling of the
wolves was now all round them sometimes nearer and sometimes further off in
the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the
hill some advanced almost to the ring of stones at a gap in the circle a great
dark wolf shape could be seen halted gazing at them a shuddering howl broke
from him as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode forward holding his staff aloft listen hound
of sauron  he cried gandalf is here fly if you value your foul skin i
will shrivel you from tail to snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap at that moment
there was a sharp twang legolas had loosed his bow there was a hideous yell
and the leaping shape thudded to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its
throat the watching eyes were suddenly extinguished gandalf and aragorn strode
forward but the hill was deserted the hunting packs had fled all about them
the darkness grew silent and no cry came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westward the waning moon was setting gleaming
fitfully through the breaking clouds suddenly frodo started from sleep without
warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp a great
host of wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side
at once
fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits draw your blades
and stand back to back
in the leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw many grey shapes
spring over the ring of stones more and more followed through the throat of
one huge leader aragorn passed his sword with a thrust with a great sweep
boromir hewed the head off another beside them gimli stood with his stout legs
apart wielding his dwarf axe the bow of legolas was singing
in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he rose up a
great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a
hill stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the
wolves they gave back before him high in the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and his voice rolled like
thunder
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a crackle and the tree above him burst into a leaf and
bloom of blinding flame the fire leapt from tree top to tree top the whole
hill was crowned with dazzling light the swords and knives of the defenders
shone and flickered the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as it flew
and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain all the others
fled
slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks a
bitter smoke curled above the burned tree stumps and blew darkly from the hill
as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky their enemies were routed and
did not return
what did i tell you mr pippin  said sam she/thing his sword wolves
wont get him that was an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed the hair
off my head
when the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead no trace of the fight
remained but the charred trees and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left
it is as i feared said gandalf these were no ordinary wolves hunting for
food in the wilderness let us eat quickly and go
that day the weather changed again almost as if it was at the command of
some power that had no longer any use for snow since they had retreated from
the pass a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that
moved in the wild could be seen from far away the wind had been turning through
north to north west during the night and now it failed the clouds vanished
southwards and the sky was opened high and blue as they stood upon the
hill side ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
we must reach the doors before sunset said gandalf or i fear we shall
not reach them at all it is not far but our path may be winding for here
aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked in this country and only once
have i been under the west wall of moria and that was long ago
there it lies he said pointing away south eastwards to where the
mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet in the distance
could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs and in their midst taller than the
rest one great grey wall when we left the pass i led you southwards and not
back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed it is well that i
did so for now we have several miles less to cross and haste is needed let us
go 
i do not know which to hope said boromir grimly that gandalf will find
what he seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for
ever all choices seem ill and to be caught between wolves and the wall the
likeliest chance lead on
gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side so eager was he to come to
moria together they led the company back towards the mountains the only road
of old to moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream the
sirannon that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had
stood but either gandalf was astray or else the land had changed in recent
years for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it only a few
miles southwards from their start
the morning was passing towards noon and still the company wandered and
scrambled in a barren country of red stones nowhere could they see any gleam of
water or hear any sound of it all was bleak and dry their hearts sank they
saw no living thing and not a bird was in the sky but what the night would
bring if it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them he was
standing on a knoll and pointing to the right hurrying up they saw below them a
deep and narrow channel it was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of water
flowed among the brown and red stained stones of its bed but on the near side
there was a path much broken and decayed that wound its way among the ruined
walls and paving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last  said gandalf this is where the stream ran
sirannon the gate stream they used to call it but what has happened to the
water i cannot guess it used to be swift and noisy come we must hurry on we
are late
the company were footsore and tired but they trudged doggedly along the
rough and winding track for many miles the sun turned from the noon and began
to go west after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again before them
the mountains frowned but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they
could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks
at length they came to a sharp bend there the road which had been veering
southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the
left turned and went due east again rounding the corner they saw before them a
low cliff some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top over it a
trickling water dripped through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved
out by a fall that had once been strong and full
indeed things have changed  said gandalf but there is no mistaking the
place there is all that remains of the stair falls if i remember right there
was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side but the main road wound
away left and climbed with several loops up to the level ground at the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the walls of
moria and the sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it let us go and
see what things are like now 
they found the stone steps without difficulty and gimli sprang swiftly up
them followed by gandalf and frodo when they reached the top they saw that
they could go no further that way and the reason for the drying up of the
gate stream was revealed behind them the sinking sun filled the cool western
sky with glimmering gold before them stretched a dark still lake neither sky
nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface the sirannon had been dammed and
had filled all the valley beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs
their stern faces pallid in the fading light final and impassable no sign of
gate or entrance not a fissure or crack could frodo see in the frowning stone
there are the walls of moria said gandalf pointing across the water and
there the gate stood once upon a time the elven door at the end of the road
from hollin by which we have come but this way is blocked none of the company
i guess will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the day it has an
unwholesome look
we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli the first thing
for the company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will
lead us even if there were no lake we could not get our baggage pony up this
stair
but in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and there are places narrow and
steep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill  said frodo i had not thought of that and poor sam i
wonder what he will say 
i am sorry said gandalf poor bill has been a useful companion and it
goes to my heart to turn him adrift now i would have travelled lighter and
brought no animal least of all this one that sam is fond of if i had had my
way i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold stars were glinting in the sky high
above the sunset when the company with all the speed they could climbed up
the slopes and reached the side of the lake in breadth it looked to be no more
than two or three furlongs at the widest point how far it stretched away
southward they could not see in the failing light but its northern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood and between the stony ridges that
enclosed the valley and the waters edge there was a rim of open ground they
hurried forward for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach
the point on the far shore that gandalf was making for and then he had still to
find the doors
when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow
creek that barred their way it was green and stagnant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards the enclosing hills gimli strode forward undeterred and found that
the water was shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge behind him they
walked in file threading their way with care for under the weedy pools were
sliding and greasy stones and footing was treacherous frodo shuddered with
disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company led bill up on to the dry ground on the far
side there came a soft sound a swish followed by a plop as if a fish had
disturbed the still surface of the water turning quickly they saw ripples
black edged with shadow in the waning light great rings were widening outwards
from a point far out in the lake there was a bubbling noise and then silence
the dusk deepened and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at a great pace and the others followed as quickly as
they could they reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs
it was narrow often hardly a dozen yards across and encumbered with fallen
rock and stones but they found a way hugging the cliff and keeping as far
from the dark water as they might a mile southwards along the shore they came
upon holly trees stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge that had once lined the road
across the drowned valley but close under the cliff there stood still strong
and living  two tall trees larger than any trees of holly that frodo had ever
seen or imagined their great roots spread from the wall to the water under the
looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes when seen far off from the top
of the stair but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throwing
deep night shadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillars at the end
of the road
well here we are at last  said gandalf here the elven way from hollin
ended holly was the token of the people of that land and they planted it here
to mark the end of their domain for the west door was made chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria those were happier days when
there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race even
between dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves that the friendship waned said gimli
i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legolas
i have heard both said gandalf and i will not give judgement now but i
beg you two legolas and gimli at least to be friends and to help me i need
you both the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better
night is at hand 
turning to the others he said while i am searching will you each make
ready to enter the mines for here i fear we must say farewell to our good beast
of burden you must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter
weather you will not need it inside nor i hope when we come through and
journey on down into the south instead each of us must take a share of what the
pony carried especially the food and the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in this forsaken place mr
gandalf  cried sam angry and distressed i wont have it and thats flat
after he has come so far and all 
i am sorry sam said the wizard but when the door opens i do not think
you will be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark of moria you will
have to choose between bill and your master
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons den if i led him protested sam
itd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about
it will be short of murder i hope said gandalf he laid his hand on the
ponys head and spoke in a low voice go with words of guard and guiding on
you he said you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendell make
your ways to places where you can find grass and so come in time to elronds
house or wherever you wish to go
there sam he will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting
home as we have
sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer bill seeming to
understand well what was going on nuzzled up to him putting his nose to sams
ear sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading all the ponys
packs and throwing them on the ground the others sorted out the goods making a
pile of all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest
when this was done they turned to watch gandalf he appeared to have done
nothing he was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the
cliff as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes gimli was wandering
about tapping the stone here and there with his axe legolas was pressed
against the rock as if listening
well here we are and all ready said merry but where are the doors i
cant see any sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimli they are
invisible and their own masters cannot find them or open them if their secret
is forgotten
but this door was not made to be a secret known only to dwarves said
gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round unless things are
altogether changed eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs
he walked forward to the wall right between the shadow of the trees there
was a smooth space and over this he passed his hands to and fro muttering
words under his breath then he stepped back
look he said can you see anything now
the moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock but they could see nothing
else for a while then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had
passed faint lines appeared like slender veins of silver running in the stone
at first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so fine that they only
twinkled fitfully where the moon caught them but steadily they grew broader and
clearer until their design could be guessed

at the top as high as gandalf could reach was an arch of interlacing
letters in an elvish character below though the threads were in places blurred
or broken the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a
crown with seven stars beneath these again were two trees each bearing
crescent moons more clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of
the door a single star with many rays
there are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is the tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star of the house of fëanor said gandalf they are wrought
of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight and sleeps until
it is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in middle earth it is
long since i heard them and i thought deeply before i could recall them to my
mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was trying to decipher the
inscription on the arch i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read
these
the words are in the elven tongue of the west of middle earth in the elder
days answered gandalf but they do not say anything of importance to us they
say only the doors of durin lord of moria speak friend and enter and
underneath small and faint is written i narvi made them celebrimbor of
hollin drew these signs
what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry
that is plain enough said gimli if you are a friend speak the password
and the doors will open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governed by words some
dwarf gates will open only at special times or for particular persons and some
have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are
known these doors have no key in the days of durin they were not secret they
usually stood open and doorwards sat here but if they were shut any who knew
the opening word could speak it and pass in at least so it is recorded is it
not gimli 
it is said the dwarf but what the word was is not remembered narvi and
his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you know the word gandalf  asked boromir in surprise
no  said the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained
silent and unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot cried boromir
glancing back with a shudder at the dark water you told us that you had once
passed through the mines how could that be if you did not know how to enter 
the answer to your first question boromir said the wizard is that i do
not know the word yet but we shall soon see and he added with a glint in
his eyes under their bristling brows you may ask what is the use of my deeds
when they are proved useless as for your other question do you doubt my tale
or have you no wits left i did not enter this way i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tell you that these doors open outwards from
the inside you may thrust them open with your hands from the outside nothing
will move them save the spell of command they cannot be forced inwards
what are you going to do then  asked pippin undaunted by the wizards
bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head peregrin took said gandalf but if
that does not shatter them and i am allowed a little peace from foolish
questions i will seek for the opening words
i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves or men or orcs that was
ever used for such a purpose i can still remember ten score of them without
searching in my mind but only a few trials i think will be needed and i
shall not have to call on gimli for words of the secret dwarf tongue that they
teach to none the opening words were elvish like the writing on the arch that
seems certain
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly touched with his staff the
silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammen

fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice the silver lines faded but the blank grey
stone did not stir
many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them then
he tried other spells one after another speaking now faster and louder now
soft and slow then he spoke many single words of elvish speech nothing
happened the cliff towered into the night the countless stars were kindled
the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast
again gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones
of command and rising wrath edro edro he cried and struck the rock
with his staff open open he shouted and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle earth
then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in silence
at that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling
of wolves bill the pony started in fear and sam sprang to his side and
whispered softly to him
do not let him run away  said boromir it seems that we shall need him
still if the wolves do not find us how i hate this foul pool  he stooped and
picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water
the stone vanished with a soft slap but at the same instant there was a
swish and a bubble great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where
the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir  said frodo i hate this place too and i
am afraid i dont know of what not of wolves or the dark behind the doors
but of something else i am afraid of the pool dont disturb it 
l wish we could get away  said merry
why doesnt gandalf do something quick  said pippin
gandalf took no notice of them he sat with his head bowed either in despair
or in anxious thought the mournful howling of the wolves was heard again the
ripples on the water grew and came closer some were already lapping on the
shore
with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet he
was laughing i have it  he cried of course of course absurdly simple
like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice mellon
the star shone out briefly and faded again then silently a great doorway was
outlined though not a crack or joint had been visible before slowly it divided
in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch until both doors lay back against
the wall through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up
but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night the company
stared in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too merry of all people
was on the right track the opening word was inscribed on the archway all the
time the translation should have been say friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened
quite simple too simple for a learned lore master in these suspicious days
those were happier times now let us go
he strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step but at that moment
several things happened frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he
fell with a cry bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear and turned tail and
dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness sam leaped after him and then
hearing frodos cry he ran back again weeping and cursing the others swung
round and saw the waters of the lake seething as if a host of snakes were
swimming up from the southern end
out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled it was pale green and
luminous and wet its fingered end had hold of frodos foot and was dragging him
into the water sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him away crying out for help twenty
others arms came rippling out the dark water boiled and there was a hideous
stench
into the gateway up the stairs quick  shouted gandalf leaping back
rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but sam to the
ground where they stood he drove them forward
they were just in time sam and frodo were only a few steps up and gandalf
had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow
shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors one came wriggling over the
threshold glistening in the starlight gandalf turned and paused if he was
considering what word would close the gate again from within there was no need
many coiling arms seized the doors on either side and with horrible strength
swung them round with a shattering echo they slammed and all light was lost a
noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm collapsed on a step in the black darkness
poor old bill  he said in a choking voice poor old bill wolves and snakes
but the snakes were too much for him i had to choose mr frodo i had to come
with you
they heard gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the
doors there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled but the doors
did not open well well  said the wizard the passage is blocked behind us
now and there is only one way out  on the other side of the mountains i fear
from the sounds that boulders have been piled up and the trees uprooted and
thrown across the gate i am sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood
so long
i felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first
touched the water said frodo what was the thing or were there many of them

i do not know answered gandalf but the arms were all guided by one
purpose something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under the
mountains there are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the
world he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in
the lake it had seized on frodo first among all the company
boromir muttered under his breath but the echoing stone magnified the sound
to a hoarse whisper that all could hear in the deep places of the world and
thither we are going against my wish who will lead us now in this deadly dark

i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me follow my staff 
as the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps he held his staff aloft
and from its tip there came a faint radiance the wide stairway was sound and
undamaged two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at the top
they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something to eat here on the landing since we
cant find a dining room  said frodo he had begun to shake off the terror of
the clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down on the upper steps dim
figures in the gloom after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third sip
of the miruvor of rivendell
it will not last much longer i am afraid he said but i think we need it
after that horror at the gate and unless we have great luck we shall need all
that is left before we see the other side go carefully with the water too
there are many streams and wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into
dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us  asked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalf it depends on many chances but going
straight without mishap or losing our way we shall take three or four marches
i expect it cannot be less than forty miles from west door to east gate in a
direct line and the road may wind much
after only a brief rest they started on their way again all were eager to
get the journey over as quickly as possible and were willing tired as they
were to go on marching still for several hours gandalf walked in front as
before in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff the light of which
just showed the ground before his feet in his right he held his sword
glamdring behind him came gimli his eyes glinting in the dim light as he
turned his head from side to side behind the dwarf walked frodo and he had
drawn the short sword sting no gleam came from the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work of elvish smiths in the
elder days these swords shone with a cold light if any orcs were near at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and
boromir in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the passage twisted round a few turns and then began to descend it went
steadily down for a long while before it became level once again the air grew
hot and stifling but it was not foul and at times they felt currents of cooler
air upon their faces issuing from half guessed openings in the walls there
were many of these in the pale ray of the wizards staff frodo caught glimpses
of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels sloping up or running
steeply down or opening blankly dark on either side it was bewildering beyond
hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courage at least he was
not as were most of the others troubled by the mere darkness in itself often
the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful but it
was always gandalf who had the final word the mines of moria were vast and
intricate beyond the imagination of gimli glóins son dwarf of the
mountain race though he was to gandalf the far off memories of a journey long
before were now of little help but even in the gloom and despite all windings
of the road he knew whither he wished to go and he did not falter as long as
there was a path that led towards his goal
do not be afraid  said aragorn there was a pause longer than usual and
gandalf and gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind
waiting anxiously do not be afraid i have been with him on many a journey if
never on one so dark and there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i have seen he will not go astray if there is any path to find
he has led us in here against our fears but he will lead us out again at
whatever cost to himself he is surer of finding the way home in a blind night
than the cats of queen berúthiel
it was well for the company that they had such a guide they had no fuel nor
any means of making torches in the desperate scramble at the doors many things
had been left behind but without any light they would soon have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from there were also in many places
holes and pitfalls and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet
echoed there were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor and every now and
then a crack would open right before their feet the widest was more than seven
feet across and it was long before pippin could summon enough courage to leap
over the dreadful gap the noise of churning water came up from far below as if
some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
rope  muttered sam i knew id want it if i hadnt got it 
as these dangers became more frequent their march became slower already they
seemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots they
were more than weary and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting
anywhere frodos spirits had risen for a while after his escape and after food
and a draught of the cordial but now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept
over him again though he had been healed in rivendell of the knife stroke that
grim wound had not been without effect his senses were sharper and more aware
of things that could not be seen one sign of change that he soon had noticed
was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions save perhaps
gandalf and he was in any case the bearer of the ring it hung upon its chain
against his breast and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight he felt the
certainty of evil ahead and of evil following but he said nothing he gripped
tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers there
was no sound but the sound of their own feet the dull stump of gimlis
dwarf boots the heavy tread of boromir the light step of legolas the soft
scarce heard patter of hobbit feet and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of
aragorn with his long stride when they halted for a moment they heard nothing
at all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or to imagine that he heard something else like the
faint fall of soft bare feet it was never loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he heard it but once it had started it never stopped
while the company was moving but it was not an echo for when they halted it
pattered on for a little all by itself and then grew still
it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines they had been going
for several hours with only brief halts when gandalf came to his first serious
check before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages all led in
the same general direction eastwards but the left hand passage plunged down
while the right hand climbed up and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and
level but very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all  said gandalf standing uncertainly
under the arch he held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or
inscription that might help his choice but nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shaking his head and i expect that you
are all as weary as i am or wearier we had better halt here for what is left
of the night you know what i mean in here it is ever dark but outside the
late moon is riding westward and the middle night has passed
poor old bill  said sam i wonder where he is i hope those wolves
havent got him yet
to the left of the great arch they found a stone door it was half closed
but swung back easily to a gentle thrust beyond there seemed to lie a wide
chamber cut in the rock
steady steady  cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed forward glad to
find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in
the open passage steady you do not know what is inside yet i will go first
he went in cautiously and the others filed behind there  he said
pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor before his feet they saw a
large round hole like the mouth of a well broken and rusty chains lay at the
edge and trailed down into the black pit fragments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going
to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry let the guide go first while you
have one
this seems to have been a guardroom made for the watching of the three
passages said gimli that hole was plainly a well for the guards use
covered with a stone lid but the lid is broken and we must all take care in
the dark
pippin felt curiously attracted by the well while the others were unrolling
blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber as far as possible
from the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over a chill air
seemed to strike his face rising from invisible depths moved by a sudden
impulse he groped for a loose stone and let it drop he felt his heart beat
many times before there was any sound then far below as if the stone had
fallen into deep water in some cavernous place there came a plunk very
distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft
whats that  cried gandalf he was relieved when pippin confessed what he
had done but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting fool of a
took  he growled this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking party
throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance now be
quiet 
nothing more was heard for several minutes but then there came out of the
depths faint knocks tom tap tap tom they stopped and when the echoes
had died away they were repeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom they
sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort but after a while the knocking
died away and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hammer or i have never heard one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it it may have nothing to do with
peregrins foolish stone but probably something has been disturbed that would
have been better left quiet pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope we
shall get some rest without further trouble you pippin can go on the first
watch as a reward he growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark but he kept on turning
round fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well he wished
he could cover the hole if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go
near it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying still and silent he was deep in
thought trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the mines and
considering anxiously the next course that he should take a false turn now
might be disastrous after an hour he rose up and came over to pippin
get into a corner and have a sleep my lad he said in a kindly tone you
want to sleep i expect i cannot get a wink so i may as well do the watching
i know what is the matter with me he muttered as he sat down by the door
i need smoke i have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took him was a dark glimpse of the
old wizard huddled on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands
between his knees the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose and the puff
of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep he had sat and watched all
alone for about six hours and had let the others rest and in the watches i
have made up my mind he said i do not like the feel of the middle way and i
do not like the smell of the left hand way there is foul air down there or i
am no guide i shall take the right hand passage it is time we began to climb
up again
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halts they marched on and they
met no danger and heard nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizards light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them the passage
they had chosen wound steadily upwards as far as they could judge it went in
great mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and wider there were now
no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side and the floor was
level and sound without pits or cracks evidently they had struck what once had
been an important road and they went forward quicker than they had done on
their first march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in a direct line east
though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more as the road climbed
upwards frodos spirits rose a little but he still felt oppressed and still
at times he heard or thought he heard away behind the company and beyond the
fall and patter of their feet a following footstep that was not an echo
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest and all
were thinking of a place where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to
right and left vanished they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway
into a black and empty space there was a great draught of warmer air behind
them and before them the darkness was cold on their faces they halted and
crowded anxiously together
gandalf seemed pleased i chose the right way he said at last we are
coming to the habitable parts and i guess that we are not far now from the
eastern side but we are high up a good deal higher than the dimrill gate
unless i am mistaken from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall i
will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant there was blaze like a flash of
lightning great shadows sprang up and fled and for a second they saw a vast
roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone before
them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall its black walls polished
and smooth as glass flashed and glittered three other entrances they saw dark
black arches one straight before them eastwards and one on either side then
the light went out
that is all that i shall venture on for the present said gandalf there
used to be great windows on the mountain side and shafts leading out to the
light in the upper reaches of the mines i think we have reached them now but
it is night outside again and we cannot tell until morning if i am right
tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in but in the meanwhile we had
better go no further let us rest if we can things have gone well so far and
the greater part of the dark road is over but we are not through yet and it is
a long way down to the gates that open on the world
the company spent that night in the great cavernous hall huddled close
together in a corner to escape the draught there seemed to be a steady inflow
of chill air through the eastern archway all about them as they lay hung the
darkness hollow and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and
vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages the
wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell
altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time  said sam
and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all
this and most in hard rock too what did they do it all for they didnt live
in these darksome holes surely 
these are not holes said gimli this is the great realm and city of the
dwarrowdelf and of old it was not darksome but full of light and splendour as
is still remembered in our songs
he rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice while the
echoes ran away into the roof
the world was young the mountains green

no stain yet on the moon was seen

no words were laid on stream or stone

when durin woke and walked alone

he named the nameless hills and dells

he drank from yet untasted wells

he stooped and looked in mirrormere

and saw a crown of stars appear

as gems upon a silver thread

above the shadow of his head



the world was fair the mountains tall

in elder days before the fall

of mighty kings in nargothrond

and gondolin who now beyond

the western seas have passed away

the world was fair in durins day



a king he was on carven throne

in many pillared halls of stone

with golden roof and silver floor

and runes of power upon the door

the light of sun and star and moon

in shining lamps of crystal hewn

undimmed by cloud or shade of night

there shone for ever fair and bright



there hammer on the anvil smote

there chisel clove and graver wrote

there forged was blade and bound was hilt

the delver mined the mason built

there beryl pearl and opal pale

and metal wrought like fishes mail

buckler and corslet axe and sword

and shining spears were laid in hoard



unwearied then were durins folk

beneath the mountains music woke

the harpers harped the minstrels sang

and at the gates the trumpets rang



the world is grey the mountains old

the forges fire is ashen cold

no harp is wrung no hammer falls

the darkness dwells in durins halls

the shadow lies upon his tomb

in moria in khazad dûm

but still the sunken stars appear

in dark and windless mirrormere

there lies his crown in water deep

till durin wakes again from sleep
i like that  said sam i should like to learn it in moria in
khazad dûm but it makes the darkness seem heavier thinking of all
those lamps are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still 
gimli was silent having sung his song he would say no more
piles of jewels  said gandalf no the orcs have often plundered moria
there is nothing left in the upper halls and since the dwarves fled no one
dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places they are
drowned in water  or in a shadow of fear
then what do the dwarves want to come back for  asked sam
for mithril answered gandalf the wealth of moria was not in gold
and jewels the toys of the dwarves nor in iron their servant such things
they found here it is true especially iron but they did not need to delve for
them all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic for here alone
in the world was found moria silver or true silver as some have called it mithril
is the elvish name the dwarves have a name which they do not tell its worth
was ten times that of gold and now it is beyond price for little is left above
ground and even the orcs dare not delve here for it the lodes lead away north
towards caradhras and down to darkness the dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril
was the foundation of their wealth so also it was their destruction they
delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed that from which they fled
durins bane of what they brought to light the orcs have gathered nearly all
and given it in tribute to sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desired it it could be beaten like copper and
polished like glass and the dwarves could make of it a metal light and yet
harder than tempered steel its beauty was like to that of common silver but
the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim the elves dearly loved
it and among many uses they made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw
upon the doors bilbo had a corslet of mithril rings that thorin gave him i
wonder what has become of it gathering dust still in michel delving
mathom house i suppose
what  cried gimli startled out of his silence a corslet of
moria silver that was a kingly gift 
yes said gandalf i never told him but its worth was greater than the
value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo said nothing but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings
of his mail shirt he felt staggered to think that he had been walking about
with the price of the shire under his jacket had bilbo known he felt no doubt
that bilbo knew quite well it was indeed a kingly gift but now his thoughts
had been carried away from the dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag
end in the days while bilbo was still there he wished with all his heart that
he was back there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering among the
flowers and that he had never heard of moria or mithril   or the ring
a deep silence fell one by one the others fell asleep frodo was on guard
as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places
dread came over him his hands were cold and his brow damp he listened all his
mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours but he heard no
sound not even the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far off where he guessed that the western
archway stood he fancied that he could see two pale points of light almost
like luminous eyes he started his head had nodded i must have nearly fallen
asleep on guard he thought i was on the edge of a dream he stood up and
rubbed his eyes and remained standing peering into the dark until he was
relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly went to sleep but it seemed to him that the
dream went on he heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light
approaching slowly he woke and found that the others were speaking softly near
him and that a dim light was falling on his face high up above the eastern
archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly
frodo sat up good morning  said gandalf for morning it is again at
last i was right you see we are high up on the east side of moria before
today is over we ought to find the great gates and see the waters of mirrormere
lying in the dimrill dale before us
i shall be glad said gimli i have looked on moria and it is very great
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have found no sign of my kindred i
doubt now that balin ever came here
after they had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once we are
tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said i think that
none of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed  said boromir which way shall we take yonder eastward arch 
maybe said gandalf but i do not know yet exactly where we are unless i
am quite astray i guess that we are above and to the north of the great gates
and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them the eastern arch
will probably prove to be the way that we must take but before we make up our
minds we ought to look about us let us go towards that light in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but i fear that the light comes only
down deep shafts
following his lead the company passed under the northern arch they found
themselves in a wide corridor as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger
and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right it was high and
flat topped and the stone door was still upon its hinges standing half open
beyond it was a large square chamber it was dimly lit but to their eyes after
so long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright and they blinked as
they entered
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and stumbled among things
lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out the chamber
was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall it slanted upwards
and far above a small square patch of blue sky could be seen the light of the
shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room a single oblong block
about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards with a curious
sense of foreboding to look more closely at it gandalf came quickly to his
side on the slab runes were deeply graven

these are daerons runes such as were used of old in moria said gandalf
here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin

lord of moria
he is dead then said frodo i feared it was so gimli
cast his hood over his face
 
the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin frodo thought
of bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf and of balins visit to the
shire long ago in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand
years ago and on the other side of the world
at length they stirred and looked up and began to search for anything that
would give them tidings of balins fate or show what had become of his folk
there was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber under the
shaft by both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying and
among them were broken swords and axe heads and cloven shields and helms some
of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades
there were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls and in them were large
iron bound chests of wood all had been broken and plundered but beside the
shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book it had been slashed and
stabbed and partly burned and it was so stained with black and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read gandalf lifted it carefully but
the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab he pored over it for
some time without speaking frodo and gimli standing at his side could see as
he gingerly turned the leaves that they were written by many different hands
in runes both of moria and of dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up it seems to be a record of the fortunes of
balins folk he said i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill dale
nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years
after their arrival the top page is marked one   three so at least two
are missing from the beginning listen to this
we drove out orcs from the great gate and guard   i think the next
word is blurred and burned probably room   we slew many in the bright
  i think   sun in the dale flói was killed by an arrow he slew the
great then there is a blur followed by flói under grass near
mirror mere the next line or two i cannot read then comes we have taken
the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in there is i cannot read what
a shaft is mentioned then balin has set up his seat in the chamber of
mazarbul
the chamber of records said gimli i guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long way said gandalf except the word gold
and durins axe and something helm then balin is now lord of
moria that seems to end a chapter after some stars another hand begins
and i can see we found truesilver and later the word wellforged
and then something i have it mithril and the last two lines óin
to seek for the upper armouries of third deep something go westwards
a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside there are several pages of the
same sort rather hastily written and much damaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light now there must be a number of leaves missing
because they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i
suppose let me see no they are too cut and stained i cannot read them we
might do better in the sunlight wait here is something a large bold hand
using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over the wizards arm he
could write well and speedily and often used the elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand said gandalf the
first clear word is sorrow but the rest of the line is lost unless it
ends in estre yes it must be yestre followed by day being the
tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale he went alone to
look in mirror mere an orc shot him from behind a stone we slew the orc hut
many more  up from east up the silverlode the remainder of the page is
so blurred that i can hardly make anything out but i think i can read we
have barred the gates and then can hold them long if and then
perhaps horrible and suffer poor balin he seems to have kept the
title that he took for less than five years i wonder what happened afterwards
but there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages here is the last page of
all he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said i fear their end was cruel listen we
cannot get out we cannot get out they have taken the bridge and second hall
frár and lóni and náli fell there then there are four
lines smeared so that i can only read went 5 days ago the last lines run
the pool is up to the wall at westgate the watcher in the water took óin
we cannot get out the end comes and then drums drums in the deep
i wonder what that means the last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of
elf letters they are coming there is nothing more gandalf paused and
stood in silent thought
a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company we cannot
get out muttered gimli it was well for us that the pool had sunk a
little and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round they seem to have made a last
stand by both doors he said but there were not many left by that time so
ended the attempt to retake moria it was valiant but foolish the time is not
come yet now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundin here he must
lie in the halls of his fathers we will take this book the book of mazarbul
and look at it more closely later you had better keep it gimli and take it
back to dáin if you get a chance it will interest him though it will
grieve him deeply come let us go the morning is passing
which way shall we go  asked boromir
back to the hall answered gandalf but our visit to this room has not
been in vain i now know where we are this must be as gimli says the chamber
of mazarbul and the hall must be the twenty first of the north end therefore
we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall and bear right and south and
go downwards the twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that is six
above the level of the gates come now back to the hall 
gandalf had hardly spoken these words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below and to tremble in
the stone at their feet they sprang towards the door in alarm doom doom
it rolled again as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of moria into a
vast drum then there came an echoing blast a great horn was blown in the hall
and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off there was a hurrying
sound of many feet
they are coming  cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
trapped  cried gandalf why did i delay here we are caught just as
they were before but i was not here then we will see what     
doom doom
slam the doors and wedge them  shouted aragorn and keep your packs on as
long as you can we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no  said gandalf we must not get shut in keep the east door ajar we
will go that way if we get a chance
another harsh horn call and shrill cries rang out feet were coming down the
corridor there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their swords
glamdring shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges boromir set
his shoulder against the western door
wait a moment do not close it yet  said gandalf he sprang forward to
boromirs side and drew himself up to his full height
who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord of moria  he cried in a
loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall of sliding stones into a
pit amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command doom boom doom went
the drums in the deep
with a quick movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door
and thrust forward his staff there was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber
and the passage outside for an instant the wizard looked out arrows whined and
whistled down the corridor as he sprang back
there are orcs very many of them he said and some are large and evil
black uruks of mordor for the moment they are hanging back but there is
something else there a great cave troll i think or more than one there is no
hope of escape that way
and no hope at all if they come at the other door as well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who was standing by the
eastern door listening the passage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hall but it is no good flying blindly
this way with the pursuit just behind we cannot block the door its key is gone
and the lock is broken and it opens inwards we must do something to delay the
enemy first we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he said grimly
feeling the edge of his sword andúril
heavy feet were heard in the corridor boromir flung himself against the door
and heaved it to then he wedged it with broken sword blades and splinters of
wood the company retreated to the other side of the chamber but they had no
chance to fly yet there was a blow on the door that made it quiver and then it
began to grind slowly open driving back the wedges a huge arm and shoulder
with a dark skin of greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap then a
great flat toeless foot was forced through below there was a dead silence
outside
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might but his sword
rang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand the blade was notched
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his
heart the shire  he cried and springing beside boromir he stooped and
stabbed with sting at the hideous foot there was a bellow and the foot jerked
back nearly wrenching sting from frodos arm black drops dripped from the
blade and smoked on the floor boromir hurled himself against the door and
slammed it again
one for the shire  cried aragorn the hobbits bite is deep you have a
good blade frodo son of drogo 
there was a crash on the door followed by crash after crash rams and
hammers were beating against it it cracked and staggered back and the opening
grew suddenly wide arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and
fell harmlessly to the floor there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs one after another leaped into the chamber
how many there were the company could not count the affray was sharp but
the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence legolas shot two
through the throat gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up
on balins tomb boromir and aragorn slew many when thirteen had fallen the
rest fled shrieking leaving the defenders unharmed except for sam who had a
scratch along the scalp a quick duck had saved him and he had felled his orc
a sturdy thrust with his barrow blade a fire was smouldering in his brown eyes
that would have made ted sandyman step backwards if he had seen it
now is the time  cried gandalf let us go before the troll returns
but even as they retreated and before pippin and merry had reached the stair
outside a huge orc chieftain almost man high clad in black mail from head to
foot leaped into the chamber behind him his followers clustered in the
doorway his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like coals and his tongue
was red he wielded a great spear with a thrust of his huge hide shield he
turned boromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorns blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged into
the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo the blow caught him on
the right side and frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned sam with a
cry hacked at the spear shaft and it broke but even as the orc flung down the
truncheon and swept out his scimitar andúril came down upon his helm
there was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder the orc fell with
cloven head his followers fled howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at them
doom doom
now  shouted gandalf now is the last chance run for it 
aragorn picked up frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair
pushing merry and pippin in front of him the others followed but gimli had to
be dragged away by legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by balins tomb
with his head bowed boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upon its
hinges it had great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened
i am all right gasped frodo i can walk put me down 
aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement i thought you were dead  he
cried
not yet  said gandalf but there is time for wonder off you go all of
you down the stairs wait a few minutes for me at the bottom but if i do not
come soon go on go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot leave you to hold the door alone  said aragorn
do as i say  said gandalf fiercely swords are no more use here go
the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark they groped their way
down a long flight of steps and then looked back but they could see nothing
except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff he seemed to be
still standing on guard by the closed door frodo breathed heavily and leaned
against sam who put his arms about him they stood peering up the stairs into
the darkness frodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above muttering
words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo he could not catch
what was said the walls seemed to be trembling every now and again the
drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light then there
was a dull rumble and a heavy thud the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom
doom boom and then stopped gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to
the ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over  said the wizard struggling to his feet i have
done all that i could but i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed
but dont stand here go on you will have to do without light for a while i am
rather shaken go on go on where are you gimli come ahead with me keep
close behind all of you
they stumbled after him wondering what had happened doom doom went
the drum beats again they now sounded muffled and far away but they were
following there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any
voice gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage seemed to be going
in the direction that he desired every now and again it descended a flight of
steps fifty or more to a lower level at the moment that was their chief
danger for in the dark they could not see a descent until they came on it and
put their feet out into emptiness gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a
blind man
at the end of an hour they had gone a mile or maybe a little more and had
descended many flights of stairs there was still no sound of pursuit almost
they began to hope that they would escape at the bottom of the seventh flight
gandalf halted
it is getting hot  he gasped we ought to be down at least to the level
of the gates now soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to take us
east i hope it is not far i am very weary i must rest here a moment even if
all the orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step what happened
away up there at the door  he asked did you meet the beater of the drums 
i do not know answered gandalf but i found myself suddenly faced by
something that i have not met before i could think of nothing to do but to try
and put a shutting spell on the door i know many but to do things of that kind
rightly requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could hear orc voices on the other side at any moment i
thought they would burst it open i could not hear what was said they seemed to
be talking in their own hideous language all i caught was ghâsh
that is fire then something came into the chamber   i felt it
through the door and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent it laid
hold of the iron ring and then it perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i have never felt such a challenge the
counter spell was terrible it nearly broke me for an instant the door left my
control and began to open i had to speak a word of command that proved too
great a strain the door burst in pieces something dark as a cloud was blocking
out all the light inside and i was thrown backwards down the stairs all the
wall gave way and the roof of the chamber as well i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybe something else is buried there
too i cannot say but at least the passage behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never felt so spent but it is passing and now what about you
frodo there was not time to say so but i have never been more delighted in my
life than when you spoke i feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that
aragorn was carrying
what about me  said frodo i am alive and whole i think i am bruised
and in pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so
tough that i have never met the like of it had i known i would have spoken
softer in the inn at bree that spear thrust would have skewered a wild boar 
well it did not skewer me i am glad to say said frodo though i feel as
if i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil he said no more he found
breathing painful
you take after bilbo said gandalf there is more about you than meets the
eye as i said of him long ago frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it
said
they now went on again before long gimli spoke he had keen eyes in the
dark i think he said that there is a light ahead but it is not daylight
it is red what can it be 
ghâsh muttered gandalf i wonder if that is what they meant
that the lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became unmistakable and could be seen by all it was
flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them they
could now see their way in front the road sloped down swiftly and some way
ahead there stood a low archway through it the glowing light came the air
became very hot
when they came to the arch gandalf went through signing to them to wait as
he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow quickly he
stepped back
there is some new devilry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt
but i know now where we are we have reached the first deep the level
immediately below the gates this is the second hall of old moria and the gates
are near away beyond the eastern end on the left not more than a quarter of a
mile across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide road through the first
hall and out but come and look 
they peered out before them was another cavernous hall it was loftier and
far longer than the one in which they had slept they were near its eastern end
westward it ran away into darkness down the centre stalked a double line of
towering pillars they were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs
upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone their stems were smooth and
black but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides right across the
floor close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened out of
it a fierce red light came and now and again flames licked at the brink and
curled about the bases of the columns wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot
air
if we had come by the main road down from the upper halls we should have
been trapped here said gandalf let us hope that the fire now lies between us
and pursuit come there is no time to lose
even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and
horn calls doom doom the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to
quiver
now for the last race  said gandalf if the sun is shining outside we may
still escape after me 
he turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall the distance was
greater than it had looked as they ran they heard the beat and echo of many
hurrying feet behind a shrill yell went up they had been seen there was a
ring and clash of steel an arrow whistled over frodos head
boromir laughed they did not expect this he said the fire has cut them
off we are on the wrong side 
look ahead  called gandalf the bridge is near it is dangerous and
narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm at the end of the hall the floor
vanished and fell to an unknown depth the outer door could only be reached by a
slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spanned the chasm with one
curving spring of fifty feet it was an ancient defence of the dwarves against
any enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer passages they could
only pass across it in single file at the brink gandalf halted and the others
came up in a pack behind
lead the way gimli  he said pippin and merry next straight on and up
the stair beyond the door 
arrows fell among them one struck frodo and sprang back another pierced
gandalfs hat and stuck there like a black feather frodo looked behind beyond
the fire he saw swarming black figures there seemed to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight doom
doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though it was a long shot for
his small bow he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear two great trolls appeared they bore great
slabs of stone and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire but it
was not the trolls that had filled the elf with terror the ranks of the orcs
had opened and they crowded away as if they themselves were afraid something
was coming up behind them what it was could not be seen it was like a great
shadow in the middle of which was a dark form of man shape maybe yet greater
and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent
over it then with a rush it leaped across the fissure the flames roared up to
greet it and wreathed about it and a black smoke swirled in the air its
streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it in its right hand was a blade like
a stabbing tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai  wailed legolas a balrog a balrog is come 
gimli stared with wide eyes durins bane  he cried and letting his axe
fall he covered his face
a balrog muttered gandalf now i understand he faltered and leaned
heavily on his staff what an evil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them the orcs yelled and
poured over the stone gangways then boromir raised his horn and blew loud the
challenge rang and bellowed like the shout of many throats under the cavernous
roof for a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted then the echoes
died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced
again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his strength fly this is a foe
beyond any of you i must hold the narrow way fly  aragorn and boromir did
not heed the command but still held their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge the others halted just within the doorway at the
halls end and turned unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reached the bridge gandalf stood in the middle of the span
leaning on the staff in his left hand but in his other hand glamdring gleamed
cold and white his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about it
reached out like two vast wings it raised the whip and the thongs whined and
cracked fire came from its nostrils but gandalf stood firm
you cannot pass he said the orcs stood still and a dead silence fell i
am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor you cannot pass
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udûn go back to the shadow
you cannot pass
the balrog made no answer the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness
grew it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly it drew itself up
to a great height and its wings were spread from wall to wall but still
gandalf could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small and altogether
alone grey and bent like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm
from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire the balrog fell back and
its sword flew up in molten fragments the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped
back a pace and then again stood still
you cannot pass  he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge its whip whirled and
hissed
he cannot stand alone  cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the
bridge elendil he shouted i am with you gandalf 
gondor  cried boromir and leaped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud he smote the bridge
before him the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand a blinding sheet of
white flame sprang up the bridge cracked right at the balrogs feet it broke
and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf while the rest
remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its shadow plunged down and
vanished but even as it fell it swung its whip and the thongs lashed and
curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink he staggered and
fell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into the abyss fly you fools 
he cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darkness fell the company stood rooted with
horror staring into the pit even as aragorn and boromir came flying back the
rest of the bridge cracked and fell with a cry aragorn roused them
come i will lead you now  he called we must obey his last command
follow me 
they stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door aragorn leading
boromir at the rear at the top was a wide echoing passage along this they
fled frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he found that he himself was
weeping as he ran doom doom doom the drum beats rolled behind
mournful now and slow doom
they ran on the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof they
ran swifter they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its high windows
in the east they fled across it through its huge broken doors they passed and
suddenly before them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light
there was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door
posts towering on either side but the gates were shattered and cast down
aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path and the rest
fled in terror of his wrath the company swept past them and took no heed of
them out of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age worn steps the
threshold of moria
thus at last they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their
faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls dimrill dale
lay about them the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but eastwards
there was a golden light on the land it was but one hour after noon the sun
was shining the clouds were white and high
they looked back dark yawned the archway of the gates under the
mountain shadow faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out nothing else was to be seen the dale all around
was empty doom grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground doom doom the
drum beats faded
 
alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn he looked towards
the mountains and held up his sword farewell gandalf  he cried did i not
say to you if you pass the doors of moria beware alas that i spoke
true what hope have we without you 
he turned to the company we must do without hope he said at least we
may yet be avenged let us gird ourselves and weep no more come we have a long
road and much to do
they rose and looked about them northward the dale ran up into a glen of
shadows between two great arms of the mountains above which three white peaks
were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras the mountains of moria at the
head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of
short falls and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains feet
yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls down the
deep cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have come if fortune
had been kinder
or caradhras less cruel said gimli there he stands smiling in the sun 
he shook his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end and
far lands could be descried beyond them wide and vague to the south the misty
mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach less than a mile away
and a little below them for they still stood high up on the west side of the
dale there lay a mere it was long and oval shaped like a great spear head
thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end was beyond the shadows
under the sunlit sky yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear evening
sky seen from a lamp lit room its face was still and unruffled about it lay a
smooth sward shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled zâram  said gimli sadly i
remember that he said may you have joy of the sight but we cannot linger
there now long shall i journey ere i have joy again it is i that must
hasten away and he that must remain
the company now went down the road from the gates it was rough and broken
fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking
stones but still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had
wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom in places there were
ruined works of stone beside the path and mounds of green topped with slender
birches or fir trees sighing in the wind an eastward bend led them hard by the
sward of mirrormere and there not far from the roadside stood a single column
broken at the top
that is durins stone  cried gimli i cannot pass without turning aside
for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale 
be swift then  said aragorn looking back towards the gates the sun
sinks early the orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk but we must be
far away before nightfall the moon is almost spent and it will be dark
tonight
come with me frodo  cried the dwarf springing from the road i would
not have you go without seeing kheled zâram he ran down the long green
slope frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and
weariness sam came up behind
beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up it was cracked and
weather worn and the faint runes upon its side could not be read this pillar
marks the spot where durin first looked in the mirrormere said the dwarf let
us look ourselves once ere we go
they stooped over the dark water at first they could see nothing then
slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound
blue and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them beyond there was
a space of sky there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars though
sunlight was in the sky above of their own stooping forms no shadow could be
seen
o kheled zâram fair and wonderful  said gimli there lies the crown
of durin till he wakes farewell  he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the green sward to the road again
what did you see  said pippin to sam but sam was too deep in thought to
answer
the road now turned south and went quickly downwards running out from
between the arms of the dale some way below the mere they came on a deep well
of water clear as crystal from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran
glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel
here is the spring from which the silverlode rises said gimli do not
drink of it it is icy cold
soon it becomes a swift river and it gathers water from many other
mountain streams said aragorn our road leads beside it for many miles for i
shall take you by the road that gandalf chose and first i hope to come to the
woods where the silverlode flows into the great river out yonder they looked
as he pointed and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the
trough of the valley and then running on and away into the lower lands until
it was lost in a golden haze
there lie the woods of lothlórien  said legolas that is the
fairest of all the dwellings of my people there are no trees like the trees of
that land for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold not till
the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall and then the boughs are
laden with yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden and golden is
the roof and its pillars are of silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and
grey so still our songs in mirkwood say my heart would be glad if i were
beneath the eaves of that wood and it were springtime 
my heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn but it lies many
miles away let us hasten 
for some time frodo and sam managed to keep up with the others but aragorn
was leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind they had
eaten nothing since the early morning sams cut was burning like fire and his
head felt light in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the
warm darkness of moria he shivered frodo felt every step more painful and he
gasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am sorry frodo  he cried full of concern so much has happened this
day and we have such need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt
and sam too you should have spoken we have done nothing to ease you as we
ought though all the orcs of moria were after us come now a little further on
there is a place where we can rest for a little there i will do what i can for
you come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west
and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying silverlode together they
plunged over a fall of green hued stone and foamed down into a dell about it
stood fir trees short and bent and its sides were steep and clothed with
harts tongue and shrubs of whortle berry at the bottom there was a level space
through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles here they rested
it was now nearly three hours after noon and they had come only a few miles
from the gates already the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush  and
fir wood and drew water aragorn tended sam and frodo sams wound was not
deep but it looked ugly and aragorns face was grave as he examined it after
a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sam  he said many have received worse than this in payment
for the slaying of their first orc the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of
orc blades too often are it should heal well when i have tended it bathe it
when gimli has heated water
he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves they are dry and some
of their virtue has one he said but here i have still some of the leaves of athelas
that i gathered near weathertop crush one in the water and wash the wound
clean and i will bind it now it is your turn frodo 
i am all right said frodo reluctant to have his garments touched all i
needed was some food and a little rest
no  said aragorn we must have a look and see what the hammer and the
anvil have done to you i still marvel that you are alive at all gently he
stripped off frodos old jacket and worn tunic and gave a gasp of wonder then
he laughed the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a
rippling sea carefully he took it off and held it up and the gems on it
glittered like stars and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of
rain in a pool
look my friends he called heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an
elven princeling in if it were known that hobbits had such hides all the
hunters of middle earth would be riding to the shire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain said
gimli gazing at the mail in wonder it is a mithril coat mithril i have
never seen or heard tell of one so fair is this the coat that gandalf spoke of
then he undervalued it but it was well given 
i have often wondered what you and bilbo were doing so close in his little
room said merry bless the old hobbit i love him more than ever i hope we
get a chance of telling him about it 
there was a dark and blackened bruise on frodos right side and breast under
the mail there was a shirt of soft leather but at one point the rings had been
driven through it into the flesh frodos left side also was scored and bruised
where he had been hurled against the wall while the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped the pungent
fragrance filled the dell and all those who stooped over the steaming water
felt refreshed and strengthened soon frodo felt the pain leave him and his
breath grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
the mail is marvellously light he said put it on again if you can bear
it my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat do not lay it aside
even in sleep unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while and
that will seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got ready to go on they put out the fire
and hid all traces of it then climbing out of the dell they took to the road
again they had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and
great shadows crept down the mountain sides dusk veiled their feet and mist
rose in the hollows away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim
lands of distant plain and wood sam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly
refreshed were able to go at a fair pace and with only one brief halt aragorn
led the company on for nearly three more hours
it was dark deep night had fallen there were many clear stars hut the
fast waning moon would not be seen till late gimli and frodo were at the rear
walking softly and not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimli broke the silence
not a sound but the wind he said there are no goblins near or my ears
are made of wood it is to be hoped that the orcs will be content with driving
us from moria and maybe that was all their purpose and they had nothing else
to do with us with the ring though orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues
into the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge
frodo did not answer he looked at sting and the blade was dull yet he had
heard something or thought he had as soon as the shadows had fallen about them
and the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of feet even
now he heard it he turned swiftly there were two tiny gleams of light behind
or for a moment he thought he saw them but at once they slipped aside and
vanished
what is it  said the dwarf
i dont know answered frodo i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw
a light like eyes i have thought so often since we first entered moria
gimli halted and stooped to the ground i hear nothing but the night speech
of plant and stone he said come let us hurry the others are out of sight
the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them before them a wide grey
shadow loomed and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the
breeze
lothlórien  cried legolas lothlórien we have come to the
eaves of the golden wood alas that it is winter 
under the night the trees stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs in the dim light of the
stars their stems were grey and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold
lothlórien  said aragorn glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trees we are still little more than five leagues from the gates but we can go
no further here let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us tonight
from the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence
we wandered in ages long ago said legolas but we hear that lórien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the
land nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell now deep in
the woods and far from the northern border
indeed deep in the wood they dwell said aragorn and sighed as if some
memory stirred in him we must fend for ourselves tonight we will go forward a
short way until the trees are all about us and then we will turn aside from
the path and seek a place to rest in
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow is
there no other way  he said
what other fairer way would you desire  said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hedge of swords said boromir by
strange paths has this company been led and so far to evil fortune against my
will we passed under the shades of moria to our loss and now we must enter the
golden wood you say but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor and it
is said that few come out who once go in and of that few none have escaped
unscathed
say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then maybe you
will speak the truth said aragorn but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the
city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlórien
believe what you will there is no other way for us   unless you would go back
to moria gate or scale the pathless mountains or swim the great river all
alone
then lead on  said boromir but it is perilous
perilous indeed said aragorn fair and perilous but only evil need fear
it or those who bring some evil with them follow me 
they had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon
another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed back
westward towards the mountains they heard it splashing over a fall away among
the shadows on their right its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before
them and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of
trees
here is nimrodel  said legolas of this stream the silvan elves made many
songs long ago and still we sing them in the north remembering the rainbow on
its falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam all is dark now and
the bridge of nimrodel is broken down i will bathe my feet for it is said that
the water is healing to the weary he went forward and climbed down the
deep cloven bank and stepped into the stream
follow me he cried the water is not deep let us wade across on the
further bank we can rest and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep
and forgetfulness of grief
one by one they climbed down and followed legolas for a moment frodo stood
near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet it was cold but its
touch was clean and as he went on and it mounted to his knees he felt that the
stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested and ate a little food
and legolas told them tales of lothlórien that the elves of mirkwood
still kept in their hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by the
great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music of the waterfall running
sweetly in the shadows almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel  asked legolas i will sing you a song
of the maiden nimrodel who bore the same name as the stream beside which she
lived lung ago it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but this is how it
runs in the westron speech as some in rivendell now sing it in a soft voice
hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began
an elven maid there was of old

a shining star by day

her mantle white was hemmed with gold

her shoes of silver grey



a star was bound upon her brows

a light was on her hair

as sun upon the golden boughs

in lórien the fair



her hair was long her limbs were white

and fair she was and free

and in the wind she went as light

as leaf of linden tree



beside the falls of nimrodel

by water clear and cool

her voice as falling silver fell

into the shining pool



where now she wanders none can tell

in sunlight or in shade

for lost of yore was nimrodel

and in the mountains strayed



the elven ship in haven grey

beneath the mountain lee

awaited her for many a day

beside the roaring sea



a wind by night in northern lands

arose and loud it cried

and drove the ship from elven strands

across the streaming tide



when dawn came dim the land was lost

the mountains sinking grey

beyond the heaving waves that tossed

their plumes of blinding spray



amroth beheld the fading shore

now low beyond the swell

and cursed the faithless ship that bore

him far from nimrodel



of old he was an elven king

a lord of tree and glen

when golden were the boughs in spring

in fair lothlórien



from helm to sea they saw him leap

as arrow from the string

and dive into the water deep

as mew upon the wing



the wind was in his flowing hair

the foam about him shone

afar they saw him strong and fair

go riding like a swan



but from the west has come no word

and on the hither shore

no tidings elven folk have heard

of amroth evermore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song ceased i cannot sing any more
he said that is but a part for i have forgotten much it is long and sad for
it tells how sorrow came upon lothlórien lórien of the blossom
when the dwarves awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came answered legolas sadly then many of the
elves of nimrodels kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost
far in the south in the passes of the white mountains and she came not to the
ship where amroth her lover waited for her but in the spring when the wind is
in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that
bear her name and when the wind is in the south the voice of amroth comes up
from the sea for nimrodel flows into silverlode that elves call celebrant and
celebrant into anduin the great and anduin flows into the bay of belfalas
whence the elves of lórien set sail but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever
came back
it is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew
near the falls for that was the custom of the elves of lórien to dwell
in the trees and maybe it is so still therefore they were called the
galadhrim the tree people deep in their forest the trees are very great the
people of the woods did not delve in the ground like dwarves nor build strong
places of stone before the shadow came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer
than sitting on the ground said gimli he looked across the stream to the road
that led back to dimrill dale and then up into the roof of dark boughs above
your words bring good counsel gimli said aragorn we cannot build a
house but tonight we will do as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops
if we can we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the
deeper woods westward along the mountain stream away from silverlode not far
from the falls of nimrodel they found a cluster of trees some of which overhung
the stream their great grey trunks were of mighty girth but their height could
not be guessed
i will climb up said legolas i am at home among trees by root or bough
though these trees are of a kind strange to me save as a name in song mellyrn
they are called and are those that bear the yellow blossom but i have never
climbed in one i will see now what is their shape and way of growth
whatever it may be said pippin they will be marvellous trees indeed if
they can offer any rest at night except to birds i cannot sleep on a perch 
then dig a hole in the ground said legolas if that is more after the
fashion of your kind but you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from
orcs he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from
the trunk high above his head but even as he swung there for a moment a voice
spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped back to earth
in surprise and fear he shrank against the bole of the tree
stand still  he whispered to the others do not move or speak 
there was a sound of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue frodo could understand little of what was said
for the speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used among themselves
was unlike that of the west legolas looked up and answered in the same
language*
who are they and what do they say  asked merry
theyre elves said sam cant you hear their voices 
yes they are elves said legolas and they say that you breathe so loud
that they could shoot you in the dark sam hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no fear they have been aware of us for a
long while they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that i was one of
their northern kindred and therefore they did not hinder our crossing and
afterwards they heard my song now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey the others they ask to
wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree until they have decided
what is to be done
out of the shadows a ladder was let down it was made of rope silver grey
and glimmering in the dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough
to bear many men legolas ran lightly up and frodo followed slowly behind came
sam trying not to breathe loudly the branches of the mallorn tree grew out
nearly straight from the trunk and then swept upward but near the top the main
stem divided into a crown of many boughs and among these they found that there
had been built a wooden platform or flet as such things were called in
those days the elves called it a talan it was reached by a round hole
in the centre through which the ladder passed
when frodo came at last up on to the flet he found legolas seated with three
other elves they were clad in shadowy grey and could not be seen among the
tree stems unless they moved suddenly they stood up and one of them uncovered
a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam he held it up looking at
frodos face and sams then he shut off the light again and spoke words of
welcome in his elven tongue frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the elf then said again in the common language speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we dwell now in the heart of the
forest and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk even our own
kindred in the north are sundered from us but there are some of us still who go
abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies and they speak
the languages of other lands i am one haldir is my name my brothers rúmil
and orophin speak little of your tongue
but we have heard rumours of your coming for the messengers of elrond
passed by lórien on their way home up the dimrill stair we had not heard
of hobbits or halflings for many a long year and did not know that any yet
dwelt in middle earth you do not look evil and since you come with an elf of
our kindred we are willing to befriend you as elrond asked though it is not
our custom to lead strangers through our land but you must stay here tonight
how many are you 
eight said legolas myself four hobbits and two men one of whom
aragorn is an elf friend of the folk of westernesse
the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known in lórien said haldir
and he has the favour of the lady all then is well but you have yet spoken
only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf  said haldir that is not well we have not had dealings with the
dwarves since the dark days they are not permitted in our land i cannot allow
him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of dáins trusty people and
friendly to elrond said frodo elrond himself chose him to be one of our
companions and he has been brave and faithful
the elves spoke together in soft voices and questioned legolas in their own
tongue very good said haldir at last we will do this though it is against
our liking if aragorn and legolas will guard him and answer for him he shall
pass but he must go blindfold through lothlórien
but now we must debate no longer your folk must not remain on the ground
we have been keeping watch on the rivers ever since we saw a great troop of
orcs going north toward moria along the skirts of the mountains many days ago
wolves are howling on the woods borders if you have indeed come from moria
the peril cannot be far behind tomorrow early you must go on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us we do not fear them
there is another talan in the next tree there the others must take
refuge you legolas must answer to us for them call us if anything is amiss
and have an eye on that dwarf
legolas at once went down the ladder to take haldirs message and soon
afterwards merry and pippin clambered up on to the high flet they were out of
breath and seemed rather scared
there said merry panting we have lugged up your blankets as well as our
own strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said haldir it is cold in the tree tops
in winter though the wind tonight is in the south but we have food and drink
to give you that will drive away the night chill and we have skins and cloaks
to spare
the hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly then
they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur cloaks of the elves but in
their own blankets as well and tried to go to sleep but weary as they were
only sam found that easy to do hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep
upstairs even when they have any stairs the flet was not at all to their
liking as a bedroom it had no walls not even a rail only on one side was
there a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed in different places
according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a while i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shant roll off he said
once i do get to sleep said sam i shall go on sleeping whether i roll
off or no and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up at the stars glinting through
the pale roof of quivering leaves sam was snoring at his side long before he
himself closed his eyes he could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting
motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers the other
had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches at last lulled
by the wind in the boughs above and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimrodel
below frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mind
late in the night he awoke the other hobbits were asleep the elves were
gone the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves the wind was still a
little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground
below there was a ring of metal the sounds died slowly away and seemed to go
southward on into the wood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet frodo sat up in alarm
and saw that it was a grey hooded elf he looked towards the hobbits
what is it  said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast on to the flet the
rope ladder rolled up
orcs  said frodo what are they doing  but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds even the leaves were silent and the very falls
seemed to be hushed frodo sat and shivered in his wraps he was thankful that
they had not been caught on the ground but he felt that the trees offered
little protection except concealment orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent
it was said but they could also climb he drew out sting it flashed and
glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull in spite
of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave frodo
rather it grew stronger he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the trees foot
far below
not elves for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their
movements then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something seemed to
be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk he stared down into the dark
holding his breath
something was now climbing slowly and its breath came like a soft hissing
through closed teeth then coming up close to the stem frodo saw two pale
eyes they stopped and gazed upward unwinking suddenly they turned away and a
shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches
there was something in this tree that i have never seen before he said it
was not an orc it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem it seemed to be
wary and to have some skill in trees or i might have thought that it was one
of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arouse any cries we cannot risk battle a
strong company of orcs has passed they crossed the nimrodel curse their foul
feet in its clean water and went on down the old road beside the river they
seemed to pick up some scent and they searched the ground for a while near the
place where you halted the three of us could not challenge a hundred so we
went ahead and spoke with feigned voices leading them on into the wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people none
of the orcs will ever return out of lórien and there will be many elves
hidden on the northern border before another night falls but you must take the
road south as soon as it is fully light
day came pale from the east as the light grew it filtered through the yellow
leaves of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool
summers morning was shining pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches
looking through an opening on the south side of the flet frodo saw all the
valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the
breeze
the morning was still young and cold when the company set out again guided
now by haldir and his brother rúmil farewell sweet nimrodel  cried
legolas frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey
tree stems farewell he said it seemed to him that he would never hear again
a running water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable notes in an
endless changeful music
they went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the
silverlode and for some way they followed it southward there were the prints
of orc feet in the earth but soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shadows
there is one of my people yonder across the stream he said though you may
not see him he gave a call like the low whistle of a bird and out of a
thicket of young trees an elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood thrown
back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun haldir skilfully cast over
the stream a coil of grey rope and he caught it and bound the end about a tree
near the bank
celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see said haldir and it
runs both swift and deep and is very cold we do not set foot in it so far
north unless we must but in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges
this is how we cross follow me he made his end of the rope fast about another
tree and then ran lightly along it over the river and back again as if he
were on a road
i can walk this path said legolas but the others have not this skill
must they swim
no said haldir we have two more ropes we will fasten them above the
other one shoulder high and another half high and holding these the strangers
should be able to cross with care
when this slender bridge had been made the company passed over some
cautiously and slowly others more easily of the hobbits pippin proved the best
for he was sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one hand
but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down sam shuffled
along clutching hard and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was
a chasm in the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across live and learn as my
gaffer used to say though he was thinking of gardening not of roosting like a
bird nor of trying to walk like a spider not even my uncle andy ever did a
trick like that 
when at length all the company was gathered on the east bank of the
silverlode the elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them rúmil who
had remained on the other side drew back the last one slung it on his
shoulder and with a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now friends said haldir you have entered the naith of lórien or
the gore as you would say for it is the land that lies like a spear head
between the arms of silverlode and anduin the great we allow no strangers to
spy out the secrets of the naith few indeed are permitted even to set foot
there
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf the other
may walk free for a while until we come nearer to our dwellings down in
egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to the liking of gimli the agreement was made without
my consent he said i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy my folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the
enemy neither have we done harm to the elves i am no more likely to betray you
than legolas or any other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir yet this is our law i am not the master
of the law and cannot set it aside i have done much in letting you set foot
over celebrant
gimli was obstinate he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand upon
the haft of his axe i will go forward free he said or i will go back and
seek my own land where i am known to be true of word though i perish alone in
the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldir sternly now you have come thus far you
must be brought before the lord and the lady they shall judge you to hold you
or to give you leave as they will you cannot cross the rivers again and
behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass you would be
slain before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his belt haldir and his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks  said legolas
come said aragorn if i am still to lead this company you must do as i
bid it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out we will all be blindfold
even legolas that will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull
gimli laughed suddenly a merry troop of fools we shall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like many blind beggars with one dog but i will be
content if only legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said legolas becoming angry in his turn
now let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said
aragorn but the company shall all fare alike come bind our eyes haldir 
i shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you do not lead
us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes
you will have no claim said haldir i shall lead you well and the paths
are smooth and straight
alas for the folly of these days  said legolas here all are enemies of
the one enemy and yet i must walk blind while the sun is merry in the woodland
under leaves of gold 
folly it may seem said haldir indeed in nothing is the power of the dark
lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who
still oppose him yet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world
beyond lothlórien unless maybe in rivendell that we dare not by our own
trust endanger our land we live now upon an island amid many perils and our
hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us but they are a sure guard no more for the
shadow has crept northward all about us some speak of departing yet for that
it already seems too late the mountains to the west are growing evil to the
east the lands are waste and full of saurons creatures and it is rumoured
that we cannot now safely pass southward through rohan and the mouths of the
great river are watched by the enemy even if we could come to the shores of the
sea we should find no longer any shelter there it is said that there are still
havens of the high elves but they are far north and west beyond the land of
the halflings but where that may be though the lord and lady may know i do
not
you ought at least to guess since you have seen us said merry there are
elf havens west of my land the shire where hobbits live
happy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea  said haldir
it is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it yet still we remember
it in song tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said merry i have never seen them i have never been out of my
own land before and if i had known what the world outside was like i dont
think i should have had the heart to leave it
not even to see fair lothlórien  said haldir the world is indeed
full of peril and in it there are many dark places but still there is much
that is fair and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief it grows
perhaps the greater
some there are among us who sing that the shadow will draw back and peace
shall come again yet i do not believe that the world about us will ever again
be as it was of old or the light of the sun as it was aforetime for the elves
i fear it will prove at best a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leave the middle earth for ever alas for lothlórien that
i love it would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew but if there
are mallorn trees beyond the great sea none have reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along the paths in the wood led
by haldir while the other elf walked behind they felt the ground beneath their
feet smooth and soft and after a while they walked more freely without fear of
hurt or fall being deprived of sight frodo found his hearing and other senses
sharpened he could smell the trees and the trodden grass he could hear many
different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead the river murmuring away
on his right and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky he felt the sun
upon his face and hands when they passed through an open glade
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank of silverlode a strange feeling had
come upon him and it deepened as he walked on into the naith it seemed to him
that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the elder days and
was  now walking in a world that was no more in rivendell there was memory of
ancient things in lórien the ancient things still lived on in the waking
world evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been known the elves
feared and distrusted the world outside wolves were howling on the woods
borders but on the land of lórien no shadow lay
all that day the company marched on until they felt the cool evening come
and heard the early night wind whispering among many leaves then they rested
and slept without fear upon the ground for their guides would not permit them
to unbind their eyes and they could not climb in the morning they went on
again walking without haste at noon they halted and frodo was aware that they
had passed out under the shining sun suddenly he heard the sound of many voices
all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they were hastening toward the
northern borders to guard against any attack from moria and they brought news
some of which haldir reported the marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost
all destroyed the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were
being pursued a strange creature also had been seen running with bent back and
with hands near the ground like a beast and yet not of beast shape it had
eluded capture and they had not shot it not knowing whether it was good or
ill and it had vanished down the silverlode southward
also said haldir they bring me a message from the lord and lady of the
galadhrim you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli it seems that the
lady knows who and what is each member of your company new messages have come
from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage first from gimlis eyes your pardon  he said
bowing low look on us now with friendly eyes look and be glad for you are
the first dwarf to behold the trees of the naith of lórien since durins
day 
when his eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were standing in an open space to the left stood a great mound covered
with a sward of grass as green as spring time in the elder days upon it as a
double crown grew two circles of trees the outer had bark of snowy white and
were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn trees of great height still arrayed in pale gold high amid the
branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a
white flet at the feet of the trees and all about the green hillsides the
grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars among them
nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white and palest green they
glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass over all the sky was blue
and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows
beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir for this is the heart
of the ancient realm as it was long ago and here is the mound of amroth where
in happier days his high house was built here ever bloom the winter flowers in
the unfading grass the yellow elanor and the pale niphredil
here we will stay awhile and come to the city of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass but frodo stood
awhile still lost in wonder it seemed to him that he had stepped through a high
window that looked on a vanished world a light was upon it for which his
language had no name all that he saw was shapely but the shapes seemed at once
clear cut as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of
his eyes and ancient as if they had endured for ever he saw no colour but
those he knew gold and white and blue and green but they were fresh and
poignant as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them
names new and wonderful in winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for
spring no blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew
upon the earth on the land of lórien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside him looking round with a
puzzled expression and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was
awake its sunlight and bright day right enough he said i thought that
elves were all for moon and stars but this is more elvish than anything i ever
heard tell of i feel as if i was inside a song if you take my meaning
haldir looked at them and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both
thought and word he smiled you feel the power of the lady of the galadhrim
he said would it please you to climb with me up cerin amroth 
they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass clad slopes though he
walked and breathed and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the
same cool wind as fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a timeless land
that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness when he had gone and
passed again into the outer world still frodo the wanderer from the shire would
walk there upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair
lothlórien
they entered the circle of white trees as they did so the south wind blew
upon cerin amroth and sighed among the branches frodo stood still hearing far
off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away and sea birds
crying whose race had perished from the earth
haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet as frodo prepared
to follow him he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder never before
had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a trees
skin and of the life within it he felt a delight in wood and the touch of it
neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the delight of the living tree
itself
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform haldir took his hand and
turned him toward the south look this way first  he said
frodo looked and saw still at some distance a hill of many mighty trees or
a city of green towers which it was he could not tell out of it it seemed to
him that the power and light came that held all the land in sway he longed
suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city then he looked eastward
and saw all the land of lórien running down to the pale gleam of anduin
the great river he lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out
and he was back again in the world he knew beyond the river the land appeared
flat and empty formless and vague until far away it rose again like a wall
dark and drear the sun that lay on lothlórien had no power to enlighten
the shadow of that distant height
there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood said haldir it is clad in a
forest of dark fir where the trees strive one against another and their
branches rot and wither in the midst upon a stony height stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling we fear that now it is inhabited
again and with power sevenfold a black cloud lies often over it of late in
this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another and
ever they strive now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very heart
of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered not yet he turned and
climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing still and silent as a tree
but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo looked at him he knew that he
beheld things as they once had been in this same place for the grim years were
removed from the face of aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvish tongue to one whom frodo could
not see arwen vanimelda namárië he said and then he drew
a breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the heart of elvendom on earth he said and here my heart dwells
ever unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread
you and i come with me  and taking frodos hand in his he left the hill of
cerin amroth and came there never again as living man
 
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows were deepening in
the woods when they went on again their paths now went into thickets where the
dusk had already gathered night came beneath the trees as they walked and the
elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale
evening sky pricked by a few early stars there was a wide treeless space before
them running in a great circle and bending away on either hand beyond it was a
deep fosse lost in soft shadow but the grass upon its brink was green as if it
glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone upon the further side there
rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with
mallorn trees taller than any they had yet seen in all the land their height
could not be guessed but they stood up in the twilight like living towers in
their many tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless lights
were gleaming green and gold and silver haldir turned towards the company
welcome to caras galadhon  he said here is the city of the galadhrim
where dwell the lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lórien but we
cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward we must go round to the
southern side and the way is not short for the city is great
there was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the
fosse along this they went westward with the city ever climbing up like a
green cloud upon their left and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth
until all the hill seemed afire with stars they came at last to a white bridge
and crossing found the great gates of the city they faced south west set
between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped and they were tall
and strong and hung with many lamps
haldir knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but of guards
frodo could see no sign the travellers passed within and the gates shut behind
them they were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall and passing quickly
through it they entered the city of the trees no folk could they see nor hear
any feet upon the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air
above far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from
on high like soft rain upon leaves
they went along many paths and climbed many stairs until they came to the
high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering it was
lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees and it fell into a
basin of silver from which a white stream spilled upon the south side of the
lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered until its first branches far above opened
their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves beside it a broad white ladder
stood and at its foot three elves were seated they sprang up as the travellers
approached and frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail and from
their shoulders hung long white cloaks
here dwell celeborn and galadriel said haldir it is their wish that you
should ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn and it was
answered three times from far above i will go first said haldir let frodo
come next and with him legolas the others may follow as they wish it is a long
climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon
the way
as he climbed slowly up frodo passed many flets some on one side some on
another and some set about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed
through them at a great height above the ground he came to a wide talan
like the deck of a great ship on it was built a house so large that almost it
would have served for a hall of men upon the earth he entered behind haldir
and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which grew the
trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards its crown and yet making still
a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was filled with a soft light its walls were green and silver and
its roof of gold many elves were seated there on two chairs beneath the bole
of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celeborn and
galadriel they stood up to greet their guests after the manner of elves even
those who were accounted mighty kings very tall they were and the lady no less
tall than the lord and they were grave and beautiful they were clad wholly in
white and the hair of the lady was of deep gold and the hair of the lord
celeborn was of silver long and bright but no sign of age was upon them unless
it were in the depths of their eyes for these were keen as lances in the
starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face
sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire  said celeborn when all have
come we will speak together
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered
welcome aragorn son of arathorn  he said it is eight and thirty years of
the world outside since you came to this land and those years lie heavy on you
but the end is near for good or ill here lay aside your burden for a while 
welcome son of thranduil too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the
north
welcome gimli son of glóin it is long indeed since we saw one of
durins folk in caras galadhon but today we have broken our long law may it be
a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand and that
friendship shall be renewed between our peoples gimli bowed low
when all the guests were seated before his chair the lord looked at them
again here there are eight he said nine were to set out so said the
messages but maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not
heard elrond is far away and darkness gathers between us and all this year
the shadows have grown longer
nay there was no change of counsel said the lady galadriel speaking for
the first time her voice was clear and musical but deeper than womans wont
gandalf the grey set out with the company but he did not pass the borders of
this land now tell us where he is for i much desired to speak with him again
but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes within the fences of lothlórien
a grey mist is about him and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden
from me
alas  said aragorn gandalf the grey fell into shadow he remained in
moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evil tidings said celeborn the most evil that have been spoken
here in long years full of grievous deeds he turned to haldir why has
nothing of this been told to me before  he asked in the elven tongue
we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose said legolas at
first we were weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost
forgot our grief for a time as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of lórien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo gandalf
was our guide and he led us through moria and when our escape seemed beyond
hope he saved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale  said celeborn
then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of caradhras and
in the days that followed and he spoke of balin and his book and the fight in
the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow bridge and the coming of
the terror an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as i have never seen
before said aragorn it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog of morgoth said legolas of all elf banes the most
deadly save the one who sits in the dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams l saw
durins bane said gimli in a low voice and dread was in his eyes
alas  said celeborn we long have feared that under caradhras a terror
slept but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up this evil in moria again
l would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders you and all that went
with you and if it were possible one would say that at the last gandalf fell
from wisdom into folly going needlessly into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life those that followed him
knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose but however it may be with
the guide the followers are blameless do not repent of your welcome to the
dwarf if our folk had been exiled long and far from lothlórien who of
the galadhrim even celeborn the wise would pass nigh and would not wish to
look upon their ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled zâram and cold are the springs of kibil nâla
and fair were the many pillared halls of khazad dûm in elder days before
the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone she looked upon gimli who sat
glowering and sad and she smiled and the dwarf hearing the names given in his
own ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes and it seemed to him that he
looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding
wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer
he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more fair is the
living land of lórien and the lady galadriel is above all the jewels
that lie beneath the earth 
there was a silence at length celeborn spoke again i did not know that
your plight was so evil he said let gimli forget my harsh words i spoke in
the trouble of my heart i will do what i can to aid you each according to his
wish and need but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burden
your quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo but we will
not here speak of it more openly yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seeking aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed for the lord
of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the elves of middle earth and a
giver of gifts beyond the power of kings he has dwelt in the west since the
days of dawn and i have dwelt with him years uncounted for ere the fall of
nargothrond or gondolin i passed over the mountains and together through ages
of the world we have fought the long defeat
i it was who first summoned the white council and if my designs had not
gone amiss it would have been governed by gandalf the grey and then mayhap
things would have gone otherwise but even now there is hope left i will not
give you counsel saying do this or do that for not in doing or contriving
nor in choosing between this course and another can i avail but only in
knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be but this i will say to
you your quest stands upon the edge of a knife stray but a little and it will
fail to the ruin of all yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that word she held them with her eyes and in silence looked
searchingly at each of them in turn none save legolas and aragorn could long
endure her glance sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes and she smiled do
not let your hearts be troubled she said tonight you shall sleep in peace
then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those who have been questioned long
and deeply though no words had been spoken openly
go now  said celeborn you are worn with sorrow and much toil even if
your quest did not concern us closely you should have refuge in this city
until you were healed and refreshed now you shall rest and we will not speak
of your further road for a while
that night the company slept upon the ground much to the satisfaction of the
hobbits the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain
and in it they laid soft couches then speaking words of peace with fair elvish
voices they left them for a little while the travellers talked of their night
before in the tree tops and of their days journey and of the lord and lady
for they had not yet the heart to look further back
what did you blush for sam  said pippin you soon broke down anyone
would have thought you had a guilty conscience i hope it was nothing worse than
a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets
i never thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest if you
want to know i felt as if i hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it she
seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i would do if she gave me the
chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole with with a bit of
garden of my own
thats funny said merry almost exactly what i felt myself only only
well i dont think ill say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fared alike each had felt that he was offered a
choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead and something that he
greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to get it he had only to turn
aside from the road and leave the quest and the war against sauron to others
and it seemed to me too said gimli that my choice would remain secret
and known only to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir maybe it was only a
test and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost
i should have said that she was tempting us and offering what she pretended to
have the power to give it need not be said that i refused to listen the men of
minas tirith are true to their word but what he thought that the lady had
offered him boromir did not tell
and as for frodo he would not speak though boromir pressed him with
questions she held you long in her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there
well have a care  said boromir i do not feel too sure of this elvish
lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadriel  said aragorn sternly you know not
what you say there is in her and in this land no evil unless a man bring it
hither himself then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without fear for
the first time since i left rivendell and may i sleep deep and forget for a
while my grief i am weary in body and in heart he cast himself down upon his
couch and fell at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber
when they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before
the pavilion and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
they remained some days in lothlórien so far as they could tell or
remember all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear save for a
gentle rain that fell at times and passed away leaving all things fresh and
clean the air was cool and soft as if it were early spring yet they felt
about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter it seemed to them that they
did little but eat and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was
enough
they had not seen the lord and lady again and they had little speech with
the elven folk for few of these knew or would use the westron tongue haldir
had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the north where
great watch was now kept since the tidings of moria that the company had
brought legolas was away much among the galadhrim and after the first night he
did not sleep with the other companions though he returned to eat and talk with
them often he took gimli with him when he went abroad in the land and the
others wondered at this change
now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of gandalf and all
that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds as they were
healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen
often they heard nearby elvish voices singing and knew that they were making
songs of lamentation for his fall for they caught his name among the sweet sad
words that they could not understand
mithrandir mithrandir
it was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words he was
seldom moved to make song or rhyme even in rivendell he had listened and had
not sung himself though his memory was stored with many things that others had
made before him but now as he sat beside the fountain in lórien and
heard about him the voices of the elves his thought took shape in a song that
seemed fair to him yet when he tried to repeat it to sam only snatches
remained faded as a handful of withered leaves
when evening in the shire was grey

his footsteps on the hill were heard

before the dawn he went away

on journey long without a word



from wilderland to western shore

from northern waste to southern hill

through dragon lair and hidden door

and darkling woods he walked at will



with dwarf and hobbit elves and men

with mortal and immortal folk

with bird on bough and beast in den

in their own secret tongues he spoke



a deadly sword a healing hand

a back that bent beneath its load

a trumpet voice a burning brand

a weary pilgrim on the road



a lord of wisdom throned he sat

swift in anger quick to laugh

an old man in a battered hat

who leaned upon a thorny staff



he stood upon the bridge alone

and fire and shadow both defied

his staff was broken on the stone

in khazad dûm his wisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next  said sam
no i am afraid not said frodo but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another go i hope youll say a word about
his fireworks said sam something like this
the finest rockets ever seen

they burst in stars of blue and green

or after thunder golden showers

came falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leave that to you sam or perhaps to bilbo but well i cant talk
of it any more i cant bear to think of bringing the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight both of
them felt restless again on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave lothlórien
what do you think of elves now sam  he said i asked you the same
question once before it seems a very long while ago but you have seen more of
them since then
i have indeed  said sam and i reckon theres elves and elves theyre
all elvish enough but theyre not all the same now these folk arent wanderers
or homeless and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to belong here
more even than hobbits do in the shire whether theyve made the land or the
lands made them its hard to say if you take my meaning its wonderfully
quiet here nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to if
theres any magic about its right down deep where i cant lay my hands on it
in a manner of speaking
you can see and feel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody working it no fireworks like poor
gandalf used to show i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and lady in all
these days i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things if she
had a mind id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo 
i wouldnt said frodo i am content and i dont miss gandalfs
fireworks but his bushy eyebrows and his quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam and dont think im finding fault ive often
wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heard of a better land than this its like being at home and on a holiday at
the same time if you understand me i dont want to leave all the same im
beginning to feel that if weve got to go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats never started as takes longest to finish as my
old gaffer used to say and i dont reckon that these folk can do much more to
help us magic or no its when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf
worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo yet i hope very much
that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spoke they saw as if she came in answer to their words the lady
galadriel approaching tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees she
spoke no word but beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of caras
galadhon and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed
garden no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky the evening star had
risen and was shining with white fire above the western woods down a long
flight of steps the lady went into a deep green hollow through which ran
murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill at the
bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree stood a basin of
silver wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to the brim and
breathed on it and when the water was still again she spoke here is the
mirror of galadriel she said i have brought you here so that you may look in
it if you will
the air was very still and the dell was dark and the elf lady beside him
was tall and pale what shall we look for and what shall we see  asked
frodo filled with awe
many things i can command the mirror to reveal she answered and to some
i can show what they desire to see but the mirror will also show things
unbidden and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we
wish to behold what you will see if you leave the mirror free to work i
cannot tell for it shows things that were and things that are things that yet
may be but which it is that he sees even the wisest cannot always tell do you
wish to look 
frodo did not answer
and you  she said turning to sam for this is what your folk would call
magic i believe though i do not understand clearly what they mean and they
seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the enemy but this if you
will is the magic of galadriel did you not say that you wished to see
elf magic 
i did said sam trembling a little between fear and curiosity ill have
a peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats going on at home he said in an aside
to frodo it seems a terrible long time that ive been away but there like as
not ill only see the stars or something that i wont understand
like as not said the lady with a gentle laugh but come you shall look
and see what you may do not touch the water 
sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin the
water looked hard and dark stars were reflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he said then he gave a low gasp for the
stars went out as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror grew grey and
then clear there was sun shining and the branches of trees were waving and
tossing in the wind but before sam could make up his mind what it was that he
saw the light faded and now he thought he saw frodo with a pale face lying
fast asleep under a great dark cliff then he seemed to see himself going along
a dim passage and climbing an endless winding stair it came to him suddenly
that he was looking urgently for something but what it was he did not know
like a dream the vision shifted and went back and he saw the trees again but
this time they were not so close and he could see what was going on they were
not waving in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an outraged voice theres that ted sandyman a cutting
down trees as he shouldnt they didnt ought to be felled its that avenue
beyond the mill that shades the road to bywater i wish i could get at ted and
id fell him
but now sam noticed that the old mill had vanished and a large red brick
building was being put up where it had stood lots of folk were busily at work
there was a tall red chimney nearby black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of
the mirror
theres some devilry at work in the shire he said elrond knew what he
was about when he wanted to send mr merry back then suddenly sam gave a cry
and sprang away i cant stay here he said wildly i must go home theyve
dug up bagshot row and theres the poor old gaffer going down the hill with his
bits of things on a barrow i must go home 
you cannot go home alone said the lady you did not wish to go home
without your master before you looked in the mirror and yet you knew that evil
things might well be happening in the shire remember that the mirror shows many
things and not all have yet come to pass some never come to be unless those
that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them the mirror
is dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands i wish i had never come
here and i dont want to see no more magic he said and fell silent after a
moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears no ill go home by
the long road with mr frodo or not at all he said but i hope i do get back
some day if what ive seen turns out true somebodys going to catch it hot 
do you now wish to look frodo  said the lady galadriel you did not wish
to see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look  asked frodo
no she said i do not counsel you one way or the other i am not a
counsellor you may learn something and whether what you see be fair or evil
that may be profitable and yet it may not seeing is both good and perilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture or
i would not have brought you here do as you will 
i will look said frodo and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the
dark water at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land mountains
loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky a long grey road wound back out
of sight far away a figure came slowly down the road faint and small at first
but growing larger and clearer as it approached suddenly frodo realized that it
reminded him of gandalf he almost called aloud the wizards name and then he
saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white in a white that shone
faintly in the dusk and in its hand there was a white staff the head was so
bowed that he could see no face and presently the figure turned aside round a
bend in the road and went out of the mirrors view doubt came into frodos
mind was this a vision of gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman
the vision now changed brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of
bilbo walking restlessly about his room the table was littered with disordered
papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it many swift scenes followed that frodo in
some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at
once the sea darkness fell the sea rose and raged in a great storm then he
saw against the sun sinking blood red into a wrack of clouds the black outline
of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the west then a wide river
flowing through a populous city then a white fortress with seven towers and
then again a ship with black sails but now it was morning again and the water
rippled with light and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the
sun a smoke as of fire and battle arose and again the sun went down in a
burning red that faded into a grey mist and into the mist a small ship passed
away twinkling with lights it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to draw
away
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as dark as if a hole had opened
in the world of sight and frodo looked into emptiness in the black abyss there
appeared a single eye that slowly grew until it filled nearly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to cry out or to withdraw his
gaze the eye was rimmed with fire but was itself glazed yellow as a cats
watchful and intent and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window
into nothing
then the eye began to rove searching this way and that and frodo knew with
certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was
one but he also knew that it could not see him not yet not unless he willed
it the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy heavier than a
great stone and his head was dragged downwards the mirror seemed to be growing
hot and curls of steam were rising from the water he was slipping forward
do not touch the water said the lady galadriel softly the vision faded
and frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver
basin he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady
i know what it was that you last saw she said for that is also in my
mind do not be afraid but do not think that only by singing amid the trees
nor even by the slender arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlórien
maintained and defended against its enemy i say to you frodo that even as i
speak to you i perceive the dark lord and know his mind or all of his mind
that concerns the elves and he gropes ever to see me and my thought but still
the door is closed 
she lifted up her white arms and spread out her hands towards the east in a
gesture of rejection and denial eärendil the evening star most beloved
of the elves shone clear above so bright was it that the figure of the
elven lady cast a dim shadow on the ground its rays glanced upon a ring about
her finger it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had come down to rest upon her
hand frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it seemed to him that he
understood
yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted to speak of it
and elrond could not do so but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and
one who has seen the eye verily it is in the land of lórien upon the
finger of galadriel that one of the three remains this is nenya the ring of
adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does not know   not yet do you not see now wherefore
your coming is to us as the footstep of doom for if you fail then we are laid
bare to the enemy yet if you succeed then our power is diminished and lothlórien
will fade and the tides of time will sweep it away we must depart into the
west or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be
forgotten
frodo bent his head and what do you wish  he said at last
that what should be shall be she answered the love of the elves for
their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and their regret
is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged yet they will cast all away
rather than submit to sauron for they know him now for the fate of lothlórien
you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own task yet i could
wish were it of any avail that the one ring had never been wrought or had
remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fair lady galadriel said frodo i will
give you the one ring if you ask for it it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh wise the lady galadriel may
be she said yet here she has met her match in courtesy gently are you
revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting you begin to see
with a keen eye i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you
offer for many long years i had pondered what i might do should the great ring
come into my hands and behold it was brought within my grasp the evil that
was devised long ago works on in many ways whether sauron himself stands or
falls would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his ring
if i had taken it by force or fear from my guest
and now at last it comes you will give me the ring freely in place of the
dark lord you will set up a queen and i shall not be dark but beautiful and
terrible as the morning and the night fair as the sea and the sun and the snow
upon the mountain dreadful as the storm and the lightning stronger than the
foundations of the earth all shall love me and despair 
she lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great
light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark she stood before frodo
seeming now tall beyond measurement and beautiful beyond enduring terrible and
worshipful then she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she
laughed again and lo she was shrunken a slender elf woman clad in simple
white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said i will diminish and go into the west and
remain galadriel
they stood for a long while in silence at length the lady spoke again let
us return  she said in the morning you must depart for now we have chosen
and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said frodo a thing which i often
meant to ask gandalf in rivendell i am permitted to wear the one ring why
cannot i see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them 
you have not tried she said only thrice have you set the ring upon your
finger since you knew what you possessed do not try it would destroy you did
not gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each
possessor before you could use that power you would need to become far
stronger and to train your will to the domination of others yet even so as
ring bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is
hidden your sight is grown keener you have perceived my thought more clearly
than many that are accounted wise you saw the eye of him that holds the seven
and the nine and did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger did you
see my ring  she asked turning again to sam
no lady he answered to tell you the truth i wondered what you were
talking about i saw a star through your finger but if youll pardon my
speaking out i think my master was right i wish youd take his ring youd put
things to rights youd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift
youd make some folk pay for their dirty work
i would she said that is how it would begin but it would not stop with
that alas we will not speak more of it let us go
 
that night the company was again summoned to the chamber of celeborn and
there the lord and lady greeted them with fair words at length celeborn spoke
of their departure
now is the time he said when those who wish to continue the quest must
harden their hearts to leave this land those who no longer wish to go forward
may remain here for a while but whether they stay or go none can be sure of
peace for we are come now to the edge of doom here those who wish may await
the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again or we
summon them to the last need of lórien then they may return to their own
lands or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle
there was a silence they all resolved to go forward said galadriel
looking in their eyes
as for me said boromir my way home lies onward and not back
that is true said celeborn but is all this company going with you to
minas tirith 
we have not decided our course said aragorn beyond lothlórien i
do not know what gandalf intended to do indeed i do not think that even he had
any clear purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this land you can no longer
forget the great river as some of you know well it cannot be crossed by
travellers with baggage between lórien and gondor save by boat and are
not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the
enemy
on which side will you journey the way to minas tirith lies upon this side
upon the west but the straight road of the quest lies east of the river upon
the darker shore which shore will you now take 
if my advice is heeded it will be the western shore and the way to minas
tirith answered boromir but i am not the leader of the company the others
said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you do not yet know what to do said celeborn it is not my
part to choose for you but i will help you as i may there are some among you
who can handle boats legolas whose folk know the swift forest river and
boromir of gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit  cried merry not all of us look on boats as wild horses
my people live by the banks of the brandywine
that is well said celeborn then i will furnish your company with boats
they must be small and light for if you go far by water there are places where
you will be forced to carry them you will come to the rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where the river thunders down from
nen hithoel and there are other perils boats may make your journey less
toilsome for a while yet they will not give you counsel in the end you must
leave them and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times the gift of boats comforted him much
not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days
the others too looked more hopeful whatever perils lay ahead it seemed
better to float down the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to plod forward
with bent backs only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought boats as
bad as wild horses or worse and not all the dangers that he had survived made
him think better of them
all shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon
tomorrow said celeborn i will send my people to you in the morning to help
you make ready for the journey now we will wish you all a fair night and
untroubled sleep
good night my friends  said galadriel sleep in peace do not trouble
your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight maybe the paths that you
each shall tread are already laid before your feet though you do not see them
good night 
the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion legolas went
with them for this was to be their last night in lothlórien and in
spite of the words of galadriel they wished to take counsel together
for a long time they debated what they should do and how it would be best to
attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring but they came to no
decision it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas tirith
and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemy they would have
been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the shadow of mordor
but frodo spoke no word and aragorn was still divided in his mind
his own plan while gandalf remained with them had been to go with boromir
and with his sword help to deliver gondor for he believed that the message of
the dreams was a summons and that the hour had come at last when the heir of
elendil should come forth and strive with sauron for the mastery but in moria
the burden of gandalf had been laid on him and he knew that he could not now
forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir and yet what
help could he or any of the company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him
into the darkness
i shall go to minas tirith alone if need be for it is my duty said
boromir and after that he was silent for a while sitting with his eyes fixed
on frodo as if he was trying to read the halflings thoughts at length he
spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself if you wish only to
destroy the ring he said then there is little use in war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cannot help but if you wish to destroy the armed might
of the dark lord then it is folly to go without force into his domain and
folly to throw away he paused suddenly as if he had become aware that he was
speaking his thoughts aloud it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he
ended it is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into
the arms of death at least that is how i see it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance and he looked
hard at him plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words it
would be folly to throw away what the ring of power he had said something
like this at the council but then he had accepted the correction of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign
that he had heeded boromirs words and so their debate ended merry and pippin
were already asleep and sam was nodding the night was growing old
in the morning as they were beginning to pack their slender goods elves
that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food
and clothing for the journey the food was mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside and inside
was the colour of cream gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a
doubtful eye
cram he said under his breath as he broke off a crisp corner and
nibbled at it his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest of the
cake with relish
no more no more cried the elves laughing you have eaten enough already
for a long days march
i thought it was only a kind of cram such as the dale men make for
journeys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answered but we call it lembas or waybread and it
is more strengthening than any food made by men and it is more pleasant than cram
by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli why it is better than the honey cakes of the
beornings and that is great praise for the beornings are the best bakers that
i know of but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers
in these days you are kindly hosts 
all the same we bid you spare the food they said eat little at a time
and only at need for these things are given to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if they are unbroken and left in
their leaf wrappings as we have brought them one will keep a traveller on his
feet for a day of long labour even if he be one of the tall men of minas
tirith
the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the company the clothes they had
brought for each they had provided a hood and cloak made according to his
size of the light but warm silken stuff that the galadhrim wove it was hard to
say of what colour they were grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they
seemed to be and yet if they were moved or set in another light they were
green as shadowed leaves or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as
water under the stars each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like
a green leaf veined with silver
are these magic cloaks  asked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answered the leader of the elves
they are fair garments and the web is good for it was made in this land they
are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean leaf and branch water and
stone they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of lórien
that we love for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make
yet they are garments not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade but
they should serve you well they are light to wear and warm enough or cool
enough at need and you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight
of unfriendly eyes whether you walk among the stones or the trees you are
indeed high in the favour of the lady for she herself and her maidens wove this
stuff and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people
after their morning meal the company said farewell to the lawn by the
fountain their hearts were heavy for it was a fair place and it had become
like home to them though they could not count the days and nights that they had
passed there as they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the
sunlight haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade
frodo greeted him with delight
i have returned from the northern fences said the elf and i am sent now
to be your guide again the dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke
and the mountains are troubled there are noises in the deeps of the earth if
any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes you would not have
been able to pass that way but come your path now goes south
as they walked through caras galadhon the green ways were empty but in the
trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing they themselves went
silently at last haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill and
they came again to the great gate hung with lamps and to the white bridge and
so they passed out and left the city of the elves then they turned away from
the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of
mallorn trees and passed on winding through rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of
the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high
green wall passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded with golden elanor
that glinted in the sun the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright
margins on the right and west the silverlode flowed glittering on the left and
east the great river rolled its broad waters deep and dark on the further
shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see
but all the banks were bleak and bare no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs
beyond the land of lórien
on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up from the meeting of the
streams there was a hythe of white stones and white wood by it were moored
many boats and barges some were brightly painted and shone with silver and
gold and green but most were either white or grey three small grey boats had
been made ready for the travellers and in these the elves stowed their goods
and they added also coils of rope three to each boat slender they looked but
strong silken to the touch grey of hue like the elven cloaks
what are these  asked sam handling one that lay upon the greensward
ropes indeed  answered an elf from the boats never travel far without a
rope and one that is long and strong and light such are these they may be a
help in many needs
you dont need to tell me that  said sam i came without any and ive
been worried ever since but i was wondering what these were made of knowing a
bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
they are made of hithlain said the elf but there is no time now
to instruct you in the art of their making had we known that this craft
delighted you we could have taught you much but now alas unless you should at
some time return hither you must be content with our gift may it serve you
well 
come  said haldir all is now ready for you enter the boats but take
care at first 
heed the words  said the other elves these boats are light built and
they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk they will not sink lade
them as you will but they are wayward if mishandled it would be wise if you
accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out here where there is a
landing place before you set off downstream
the company was arranged in this way aragorn frodo and sam were in one
boat boromir merry and pippin in another and in the third were legolas and
gimli who had now become fast friends in this last boat most of the goods and
packs were stowed the boats were moved and steered with short handled paddles
that had broad leaf shaped blades when all was ready aragorn led them on a
trial up the silverlode the current was swift and they went forward slowly sam
sat in the bows clutching the sides and looking back wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes as they passed beyond the
green field of the tongue the trees drew down to the rivers brink here and
there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream the air was very
bright and still and there was a silence except for the high distant song of
larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there sailing proudly down the
stream toward them they saw a swan of great size the water rippled on either
side of the white breast beneath its curving neck its beak shone like burnished
gold and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones its huge white wings
were half lifted a music came down the river as it drew nearer and suddenly
they perceived that it was a ship wrought and carved with elven skill in the
likeness of a bird two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles in
the midst of the vessel sat celeborn and behind him stood galadriel tall and
white a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair and in her hand she held a
harp and she sang sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear
air
i sang of leaves of leaves of gold and leaves of gold there grew

of wind i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew

beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam was on the sea

and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree

beneath the stars of ever eve in eldamar it shone

in eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion

there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years

while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears

o lórien the winter comes the bare and leafless day

the leaves are falling in the stream the river flows away

o lórien too long i have dwelt upon this hither shore

and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor

but if of ships i now should sing what ship would come to me

what ship would bear me ever back across so wide a sea
aragorn stayed his boat as the swan ship drew alongside the lady ended her
song and greeted them we have come to bid you our last farewell she said
and to speed you with blessings from our land
though you have been our guests said celeborn you have not yet eaten
with us and we bid you therefore to a parting feast here between the flowing
waters that will bear you far from lórien
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and they turned their boats and
followed it there in the last end of egladil upon the green grass the parting
feast was held but frodo ate and drank little heeding only the beauty of the
lady and her voice she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with
hidden power already she seemed to him as by men of later days elves still at
times are seen present and yet remote a living vision of that which has
already been left far behind by the flowing streams of time
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass celeborn spoke to
them again of their journey and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods
beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will find that the trees will fail
and you will come to a barren country there the river flows in stony vale amid
high moors until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the
tindrock that we call tol brandir there it casts its arms about the steep
shores of the isle and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the
cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf the wetwang as it is called in your
tongue that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous
and much divided there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the forest of
fangorn in the west about that stream on this side of the great river lies
rohan on the further side are the bleak hills of the emyn muil the wind blows
from the east there for they look out over the dead marshes and the noman lands
to cirith gorgor and the black gates of mordor
boromir and any that go with him seeking minas tirith will do well to
leave the great river above rauros and cross the entwash before it finds the
marshes yet they should not go too far up that stream nor risk becoming
entangled in the forest of fangorn that is a strange land and is now little
known but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir but what i
have heard seems to me for the most part old wives tales such as we tell to
our children all that lies north of rohan is now to us so far away that fancy
can wander freely there of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm but
it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it to prove or disprove the
legends that have come down from distant years
i have myself been at whiles in rohan but i have never crossed it
northwards when i was sent out as a messenger i passed through the gap by the
skirts of the white mountains and crossed the isen and the greyflood into
northerland a long and wearisome journey four hundred leagues i reckoned it
and it took me many months for i lost my horse at tharbad at the fording of
the greyflood after that journey and the road i have trodden with this
company i do not much doubt that i shall find a way through rohan and fangorn
too if need be
then i need say no more said celeborn but do not despise the lore that
has come down from distant years for oft it may chance that old wives keep in
memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a cup from one of her maidens
she filled it with white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said drink lord of the
galadhrim and let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon and
already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the company and bade them drink and
farewell but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass
and chairs were set for her and for celeborn her maidens stood silent about
her and a while she looked upon her guests at last she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and the shadows fall between
us but before you go i have brought in my ship gifts which the lord and lady
of the galadhrim now offer you in memory of lothlórien then she called
to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the leader of your company
she said to aragorn and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his
sword it was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver
and gold and on it were set in elven runes formed of many gems the name andúril
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even
in defeat she said but is there aught else that you desire of me at our
parting for darkness will flow between us and it may be that we shall not meet
again unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know all my desire and long held in keeping
the only treasure that i seek yet it is not yours to give me even if you
would and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet maybe this will lighten your heart said galadriel for it was left in
my care to be given to you should you pass through this land then she lifted
from her lap a great stone of a clear green set in a silver brooch that was
wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings and as she held it up
the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring this stone i
gave to celebrían my daughter and she to hers and now it comes to you
as a token of hope in this hour take the name that was foretold for you
elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil 
then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast and those
who saw him wondered for they had not marked before how tall and kingly he
stood and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his
shoulders for the gifts that you have given me i thank you he said o lady
of lórien of whom were sprung celebrían and arwen evenstar what
praise could i say more 
the lady bowed her head and she turned then to boromir and to him she gave
a belt of gold and to merry and pippin she gave small silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a golden flower to legolas she gave a bow such as the
galadhrim used longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and strung with a
string of elf hair with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lover of trees she said to sam i have only a
small gift she put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood unadorned
save for a single silver rune upon the lid here is set g for galadriel she
said but also it may stand for garden in your tongue in this box there is
earth from my orchard and such blessing as galadriel has still to bestow is
upon it it will not keep you on your road nor defend you against any peril
but if you keep it and see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward
you though you should find all barren and laid waste there will be few gardens
in middle earth that will bloom like your garden if you sprinkle this earth
there then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far off of lórien
that you have seen only in our winter for our spring and our summer are gone
by and they will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible as he clutched the
box and bowed as well as he could
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves  said galadriel turning to
gimli
none lady answered gimli it is enough for me to have seen the lady of
the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hear all ye elves  she cried to those about her let none say again that
dwarves are grasping and ungracious yet surely gimli son of glóin you
desire something that i could give name it i bid you you shall not be the
only guest without a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unless it might be   unless it is permitted to ask nay to name a
single strand of your hair which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars
surpass the gems of the mine i do not ask for such a gift but you commanded me
to name my desire
the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment and celeborn gazed at the
dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled it is said that the skill of the dwarves
is in their hands rather than in their tongues  she said yet that is not true
of gimli for none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous
and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to speak but tell me what would
you do with such a gift 
treasure it lady he answered in memory of your words to me at our first
meeting and if ever i return to the smithies of my home it shall be set in
imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good will
between the mountain and the wood until the end of days
then the lady unbraided one of her long tresses and cut off three golden
hairs and laid them in gimlis hand these words shall go with the gift she
said i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain on the one hand lies
darkness and on the other only hope but if hope should not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glóin that your hands shall flow with gold and yet
over you gold shall have no dominion
and you ring bearer she said turning to frodo i come to you last who
are not last in my thoughts for you i have prepared this she held up a small
crystal phial it glittered as she moved it and rays of white light sprang from
her hand in this phial she said is caught the light of eärendils
star set amid the waters of my fountain it will shine still brighter when
night is about you may it be a light to you in dark places when all other
lights go out remember galadriel and her mirror 
frodo took the phial and for a moment as it shone between them he saw her
again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible he
bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led them back to the hythe a yellow noon
lay on the green land of the tongue and the water glittered with silver all at
last was made ready the company took their places in the boats as before
crying farewell the elves of lórien with long grey poles thrust them out
into the flowing stream and the rippling waters bore them slowly away the
travellers sat still without moving or speaking on the green bank near to the
very point of the tongue the lady galadriel stood alone and silent as they
passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from
them for so it seemed to them lórien was slipping backward like a
bright ship masted with enchanted trees sailing on to forgotten shores while
they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world
even as they gazed the silverlode passed out into the currents of the great
river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards soon the white form
of the lady was small and distant she shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill in the westering sun or as a remote lake seen from a mountain a crystal
fallen in the lap of the land then it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms
in a final farewell and far but piercing clear on the following wind came the
sound of her voice singing but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the elves
beyond the sea and he did not understand the words fair was the music but it
did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words they remained graven in his memory and
long afterwards he interpreted them as well as he could the language was that
of elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth

ah like gold fall the leaves in the wind long years numberless as the
wings of trees the long years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead
in lofty halls beyond the west beneath the blue vaults of varda wherein the
stars tremble in the song of her voice holy and queenly who now shall refill
the cup for me for now the kindler varda the queen of the stars from mount
everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds and all paths are drowned deep in
shadow and out of a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between us
and mist covers the jewels of calacirya for ever now lost lost to those from
the east is valimar farewell maybe thou shalt find valimar maybe even thou
shalt find it farewell  varda is the name of that lady whom the elves in
these lands of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks rose upon either side
and the light of lórien was hidden to that fair land frodo never came
again
the travellers now turned their faces to the journey the sun was before
them and their eyes were dazzled for all were filled with tears gimli wept
openly
i have looked the last upon that which was fairest he said to legolas his
companion henceforward i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift he
put his hand to his breast
tell me legolas why did i come on this quest little did i know where the
chief peril lay truly elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we
might meet upon our road torment in the dark was the danger that i feared and
it did not hold me back but i would not have come had i known the danger of
light and joy now i have taken my worst wound in this parting even if i were
to go this night straight to the dark lord alas for gimli son of glóin

nay  said legolas alas for us all and for all that walk the world in
these after days for such is the way of it to find and lose as it seems to
those whose boat is on the running stream but i count you blessed gimli son of
glóin for your loss you suffer of your own free will and you might have
chosen otherwise but you have not forsaken your companions and the least
reward that you shall have is that the memory of lothlórien shall remain
ever clear and unstained in your heart and shall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe said gimli and i thank you for your words true words doubtless
yet all such comfort is cold memory is not what the heart desires that is only
a mirror be it clear as kheled zâram or so says the heart of gimli the
dwarf elves may see things otherwise indeed i have heard that for them memory
is more like to the waking world than to a dream not so for dwarves
but let us talk no more of it look to the boat she is too low in the water
with all this baggage and the great river is swift i do not wish to drown my
grief in cold water he took up a paddle and steered towards the western bank
following aragorns boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle
stream
so the company went on their long way down the wide hurrying waters borne
ever southwards bare woods stalked along either bank and they could not see
any glimpse of the lands behind the breeze died away and the river flowed
without a sound no voice of bird broke the silence the sun grew misty as the
day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl then it
faded into the west and dusk came early followed by a grey and starless night
far into the dark quiet hours they floated on guiding their boats under the
overhanging shadows of the western woods great trees passed by like ghosts
thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water it
was dreary and cold frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the
river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near the shore until his head
nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep
 
frodo was roused by sam he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the
great river anduin he had slept the night away and the grey of morning was
dim among the bare branches gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
they started again before the day was broad not that most of the company
were eager to hurry southwards they were content that the decision which they
must make at latest when they came to rauros and the tindrock isle still lay
some days ahead and they let the river bear them on at its own pace having no
desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond whichever course they took
in the end aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished husbanding
their strength against weariness to come but he insisted that at least they
should start early each day and journey on far into the evening for he felt in
his heart that time was pressing and he feared that the dark lord had not been
idle while they lingered in lórien
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next the dull
grey hours passed without event as the third day of their voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether on the
eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away
toward the sky brown and withered they looked as if fire had passed over them
leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree
or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness they had come to the brown lands that
lay vast and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn
muil what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy had so blasted all that
region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was treeless also but it was flat and
in many places green with wide plains of grass on this side of the river they
passed forests of great reeds so tall that they shut out all view to the west
as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders their dark
withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs hissing softly and
sadly here and there through openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses of
rolling meads and far beyond them hills in the sunset and away on the edge of
sight a dark line where marched the southernmost ranks of the misty mountains
there was no sign of living moving things save birds of these there were
many small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan wings and looking
up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
swans  said sam and mighty big ones too 
yes said aragorn and they are black swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks  said frodo i
always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier until
winter was left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn it is still
winter and we are far from the sea here the world is cold until the sudden
spring and we may yet have snow again far away down in the bay of belfalas to
which anduin runs it is warm and merry maybe or would be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess south of the southfarthing
away in your shire hundreds of long miles yonder you are looking now
south west across the north plains of the riddermark rohan the land of the
horse lords ere long we shall come to the mouth of the limlight that runs down
from fangorn to join the great river that is the north boundary of rohan and
of old all that lay between limlight and the white mountains belonged to the
rohirrim it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass has no rival but in
these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or ride often to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream and
of late it is said they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and
studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily the trees had seemed hostile before
as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the
trees were still there he felt that the company was too naked afloat in little
open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and on a river that was the
frontier of war
in the next day or two as they went on borne steadily southwards this
feeling of insecurity grew on all the company for a whole day they took to
their paddles and hastened forward the banks slid by soon the river broadened
and grew more shallow long stony beaches lay upon the east and there were
gravel shoals in the water so that careful steering was needed the brown lands
rose into bleak wolds over which flowed a chill air from the east on the other
side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen
and tussock frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear sun
and gentle rains of lothlórien there was little speech and no laughter
in any of the boats each member of the company was busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some
northern glade amid the beech woods gimli was fingering gold in his mind and
wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease for boromir sat muttering
to himself sometimes biting his nails as if some restlessness or doubt
consumed him sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind
aragorns then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught a queer gleam in
his eye as he peered forward gazing at frodo sam had long ago made up his mind
that though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to
believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined he was
cramped and miserable having nothing to do but stare at the winter lands
crawling by and the grey water on either side of him even when the paddles were
in use they did not trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was looking back over the bowed heads
of frodo and aragorn and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for camp
and the feel of earth under his toes suddenly something caught his sight at
first he stared at it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes but when
he looked again he could not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank sam lay
rolled in blankets beside frodo i had a funny dream an hour or two before we
stopped mr frodo he said or maybe it wasnt a dream funny it was anyway
well what was it  said frodo knowing that sam would not settle down
until he had told his tale whatever it was i havent seen or thought of
anything to make me smile since we left lothlórien
it wasnt funny that way mr frodo it was queer all wrong if it wasnt a
dream and you had best hear it it was like this i saw a log with eyes 
the logs all right said frodo there are many in the river but leave
out the eyes 
that i wont said sam  twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak i
saw what i took to be a log floating along in the half light behind gimlis
boat but i didnt give much heed to it then it seemed as if the log was slowly
catching us up and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as we were all
floating on the stream together just then i saw the eyes two pale sort of
points shiny like on a hump at the near end of the log whats more it wasnt
a log for it had paddle feet like a swans almost only they seemed bigger
and kept dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes meaning to give a shout if
it was still there when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head for the
whatever it was was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimli but
whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring or whether i came to my
senses i dont know when i looked again it wasnt there yet i think i caught
a glimpse with the tail of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
under the shadow of the bank i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said and i said
no more just then but ive been thinking since and now im not so sure what
do you make of it mr frodo 
i should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes
sam said frodo if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen but
it isnt i saw them away back north before we reached lórien and i saw
a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night haldir saw it too
and do you remember the report of the elves that went after the orc band 
ah said sam i do and i remember more too i dont like my thoughts but
thinking of one thing and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy i
could put a name on the creature at a guess a nasty name gollum maybe 
yes that is what i have feared for some time said frodo ever since the
night on the flet i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up our trail
then but i hoped that our stay in lórien would throw him off the scent
again the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods by the
silverlode watching us start off 
thats about it said sam and wed better be a bit more watchful
ourselves or well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights
if we ever wake up to feel anything and thats what i was leading up to no
need to trouble strider or the others tonight ill keep watch i can sleep
tomorrow being no more than luggage in a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes you
shall watch but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning if
nothing happens before then
in the dead hours frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find sam shaking
him its a shame to wake you whispered sam but thats what you said
theres nothing to tell or not much i thought i heard some soft plashing and a
sniffing noise a while back but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river
at night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in his blankets and fought off his
sleep minutes or hours passed slowly and nothing happened frodo was just
yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape hardly visible
floated close to one of the moored boats a long whitish hand could be dimly
seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly
as they peered inside and then they lifted and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away and frodo heard the soft hiss of
intaken breath he stood up drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
immediately their light was shut off there was another hiss and a splash and
the dark log shape shot away downstream into the night aragorn stirred in his
sleep turned over and sat up
what is it  he whispered springing up and coming to frodo i felt
something in my sleep why have you drawn your sword 
gollum answered frodo or at least so i guess
ah  said aragorn so you know about our little footpad do you he padded
after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel since we took to boats
he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet i have tried to
catch him once or twice at night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as
a fish i hoped the river voyage would beat him but he is too clever a
waterman
we shall have to try going faster tomorrow you lie down now and i will
keep watch for what is left of the night i wish i could lay my hands on the
wretch we might make him useful but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose
him he is very dangerous quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is about on our track
the night passed without gollum showing so much as a shadow again after that
the company kept a sharp look out but they saw no more of gollum while the
voyage lasted if he was still following he was very wary and cunning at
aragorns bidding they paddled now for long spells and the banks went swiftly
by but they saw little of the country for they journeyed mostly by night and
twilight resting by day and lying as hidden as the land allowed in this way
the time passed without event until the seventh day
the weather was still grey and overcast with wind from the east but as
evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared and pools of faint light
yellow and pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud there the white
rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes sam looked at
it and puckered his brows
the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly the banks
began to rise and grow stony soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land
and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and
sloe tangled with brambles and creepers behind them stood low crumbling
cliffs and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these
again there rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs they were drawing
near to the grey hill country of the emyn muil the southern march of
wilderland
there were many birds about the cliffs and the rock chimneys and all day
high in the air flocks of birds had been circling black against the pale sky
as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched the flights doubtfully
wondering if gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage
was now moving in the wilderness later as the sun was setting and the company
was stirring and getting ready to start again he descried a dark spot against
the fading light a great bird high and far off now wheeling now flying on
slowly southwards
what is that legolas  he asked pointing to the northern sky is it as
i think an eagle 
yes said legolas it is an eagle a hunting eagle i wonder what that
forebodes it is far from the mountains
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth night of their journey came it was silent and windless the grey
east wind had passed away the thin crescent of the moon had fallen early into
the pale sunset but the sky was clear above and though far away in the south
there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly in the west stars
glinted bright
come  said aragorn we will venture one more journey by night we are
coming to reaches of the river that i do not know well for i have never
journeyed by water in these parts before not between here and the rapids of
sarn gebir but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
still there are dangerous places even before we come there rocks and stony
eyots in the stream we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly
to sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman he lay forward
peering into the gloom the night grew dark but the stars above were strangely
bright and there was a glimmer on the face of the river it was close on
midnight and they had been drifting for some while hardly using the paddles
when suddenly sam cried out only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the
stream and he heard the swirl of racing water there was a swift current which
swung left towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear as they were
swept aside the travellers could see now very close the pale foam of the river
lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a
ridge of teeth the boats were all huddled together
hoy there aragorn  shouted boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night but no boat can live in
sarn gebir be it night or day
back back  cried aragorn turn turn if you can  he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am out of my reckoning he said to frodo i did not know that we had
come so far anduin flows faster than i thought sarn gebir must be close at
hand already
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about but
at first they could make only small headway against the current and all the
time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank now dark and
ominous it loomed up in the night
all together paddle  shouted boromir paddle or we shall be driven on
the shoals even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment there was a twang of bowstrings several arrows whistled over
them and some fell among them one smote frodo between the shoulders and he
lurched forward with a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat of mail another passed through aragorns hood and a
third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat close by merrys hand sam
thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long
shingle banks that lay under the eastern shore they seemed very near
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
orcs  cried gimli
gollums doing ill be bound said sam to frodo and a nice place to
choose too the river seems set on taking us right into their arms 
they all leaned forward straining at the paddles even sam took a hand every
moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows many whined
overhead or struck the water nearby but there were no more hits it was dark
but not too dark for the night eyes of orcs and in the star glimmer they must
have offered their cunning foes some mark unless it was that the grey cloaks of
lórien and the grey timber of the elf wrought boats defeated the malice
of the archers of mordor
stroke by stroke they laboured on in the darkness it was hard to be sure
that they were indeed moving at all but slowly the swirl of the water grew
less and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night at last as
far as they could judge they had reached the middle of the stream again and had
driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks then half turning
they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore under the
shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew breath
legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from lórien
then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank stringing the bow and
fitting an arrow he turned peering back over the river into the darkness
across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him as he gazed into the
night seeking a mark to shoot at his head was dark crowned with sharp white
stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind but now rising and
sailing up from the south the great clouds advanced sending out dark outriders
into the starry fields a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up even as he did
so a dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more
swiftly came out of the blackness in the south and sped towards the company
blotting out all light as it approached soon it appeared as a great winged
creature blacker than the pits in the night fierce voices rose up to greet it
from across the water frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and
clutching at his heart there was a deadly cold like the memory of an old
wound in his shoulder he crouched down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lórien sang shrill went the arrow from the
elven string frodo looked up almost above him the winged shape swerved there
was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out of the air vanishing down into the
gloom of the eastern shore the sky was clean again there was a tumult of many
voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness and then silence neither
shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back upstream they felt their way along
the waters edge for some distance until they found a small shallow bay a few
low trees grew there close to the water and behind them rose a steep rocky
bank here the company decided to stay and await the dawn it was useless to
attempt to move further by night they made no camp and lit no fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the hand and eye of legolas  said
gimli as he munched a wafer of lembas that was a mighty shot in the
dark my friend
but who can say what it hit said legolas
i cannot said gimli but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer i
liked it not at all too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria   the shadow
of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with the chill that had
come upon him it was something colder i think it was   then he paused and
fell silent
what do you think  asked boromir eagerly leaning from his boat as if he
was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i think   no i will not say answered frodo whatever it was its fall
has dismayed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do not know this night we must all be sleepless dark hides us
now but what the day will show who can tell have your weapons close to hand 
sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers
and looking up at the sky its very strange he murmured the moons the
same in the shire and in wilderland or it ought to be but either its out of
its running or im all wrong in my reckoning youll remember mr frodo the
moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree a week from the full i
reckon and wed been a week on the way last night when up pops a new moon as
thin as a nail paring as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for certain and i seem to remember
several more but i would take my oath it was never a whole month anyone would
think that time did not count in there 
and perhaps that was the way of it said frodo in that land maybe we
were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by it was not i think until
silverlode bore us back to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal lands to the great sea and i dont remember any moon either new
or old in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolas stirred in his boat nay time does not tarry ever he said but
change and growth is not in all things and places alike for the elves the world
moves and it moves both very swift and very slow swift because they
themselves change little and all else fleets by it is a grief to them slow
because they do not count the running years not for themselves the passing
seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream yet beneath the
sun all things must wear to an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lórien said frodo the power of the
lady is on it rich are the hours though short they seem in caras galadhon
where galadriel wields the elven ring
that should not have been said outside lórien not even to me said
aragorn speak no more of it but so it is sam in that land you lost your
count there time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves the old moon passed
and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside while we tarried there and
yestereve a new moon came again winter is nearly gone time flows on to a
spring of little hope
the night passed silently no voice or call was heard again across the water
the travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather the air
grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from
the south and the distant seas the rushing of the river over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grow louder and closer the twigs of the trees above them began
to drip
when the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless there was mist on
the river and white fog swathed the shore the far bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one now perhaps
we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn but it will be hard to find the path unless the
fog lifts a little later on and we must find the path if we are to pass sarn
gebir and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the rapids or follow the river any further
said boromir if the emyn muil lie before us then we can abandon these
cockle boats and strike westward and southward until we come to the entwash
and cross into my own land
we can if we are making for minas tirith said aragorn but that is not
yet agreed and such a course may be more perilous than it sounds the vale of
entwash is flat and fenny and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and
laden i would not abandon our boats until we must the river is at least a path
that cannot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bank objected boromir and even if you
pass the gates of argonath and come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do
then leap down the falls and land in the marshes 
no  answered aragorn say rather that we will bear our boats by the
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the water again do you not know
boromir or do you choose to forget the north stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that were made in the days of the great kings i at least have a mind to
stand in that high place again before i decide my further course there maybe
we shall see some sign that will guide us
boromir held out long against this choice but when it became plain that
frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in it is not the way of
the men of minas tirith to desert their friends at need he said and you will
need my strength if ever you are to reach the tindrock to the tall isle i will
go but no further there i shall turn to my home alone if my help has not
earned the reward of any companionship
the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little it was decided that
aragorn and legolas should at once go forward along the shore while the others
remained by the boats aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry
both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said but that does not say
that we should come through sarn gebir alive none have ever done so yet no
road was made by the men of gondor in this region for even in their great days
their realm did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but there is a
portage way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it it cannot yet have
perished for light boats used to journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath
and still did so until a few years ago when the orcs of mordor began to
multiply
seldom in my life has any boat come out of the north and the orcs prowl on
the east shore said boromir if you go forward peril will grow with every
mile even if you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn wait for us
one day if we do not return in that time you will know that evil has indeed
befallen us then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw aragorn and legolas climb the steep
bank and vanish into the mists but his fears proved groundless only two or
three hours had passed and it was barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of
the explorers appeared again
all is well said aragorn as he clambered down the bank there is a
track and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable the distance is
not great the head of the rapids is but half a mile below us and they are
little more than a mile long not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and
smooth again though it runs swiftly our hardest task will be to get our boats
and baggage to the old portage way we have found it but it lies well back from
the water side here and runs under the lee of a rock wall a furlong or more
from the shore we did not find where the northward landing lies if it still
remains we must have passed it yesterday night we might labour far upstream
and yet miss it in the fog i fear we must leave the river now and make for the
portage way as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gimli the legs of men will lag on a rough road while
a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his own weight master boromir 
the task proved hard indeed yet in the end it was done the goods were taken
out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank where there was a level
space then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up they were far
less heavy than any had expected of what tree growing in the elvish country
they were made not even legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangely
light merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to lift and haul them over the
ground that the company now had to cross it sloped up away from the river a
tumbled waste of grey limestone boulders with many hidden holes shrouded with
weeds and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells and here and
there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while the others toiled and
scrambled after them with the baggage at last all was removed and laid on the
portage way then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forward all together fog still hung in veils
upon the crumbling rock wall and to their left mist shrouded the river they
could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of sarn
gebir but they could not see it twice they made the journey before all was
brought safe to the southern landing
there the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently down to the
shallow edge of a little pool it seemed to have been scooped in the river side
not by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn gebir against a low pier
of rock that jutted out some way into the stream beyond it the shore rose sheer
into a grey cliff and there was no further passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the rapids
hidden in the mist they were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy
as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir we
need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind to pass the gates of argonath by
night we are all too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn tomorrow we must journey
by day again unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we shall have
a good chance of slipping through unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore but
tonight two must watch together in turns three hours off and one on guard
nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before
dawn as soon as it was fully light they started already the fog was thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western side and they could see the dim
shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in
the hurrying river in the mid morning the clouds drew down lower and it began
to rain heavily they drew the skin covers over their boats to prevent them from
being flooded and drifted on little could be seen before them or about them
through the grey falling curtains
the rain however did not last long slowly the sky above grew lighter and
then suddenly the clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed away
northward up the river the fogs and mists were gone before the travellers lay
a wide ravine with great rocky sides to which clung upon shelves and in narrow
crevices a few thrawn trees the channel grew narrower and the river swifter
now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning whatever
they might meet ahead over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them the
dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out the sun the hills
of emyn muil in which no opening could be seen
frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching like
great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed tall and sheer and ominous they
stood upon either side of the stream a narrow gap appeared between them and
the river swept the boats towards it
behold the argonath the pillars of the kings  cried aragorn we shall
pass them soon keep the boats in line and as far apart as you can hold the
middle of the stream 
as frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet
him giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening then
he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned the craft and power of old
had wrought upon them and still they preserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn upon great
pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone still with
blurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the north the left hand of
each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning in each right hand there
was an axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown great power and
majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished kingdom awe and
fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down shutting his eyes and not daring to
look up as the boat drew near even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled
by frail and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow of the
sentinels of númenor so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side far off
was the dim sky the black waters roared and echoed and a wind screamed over
them frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering and groaning
what a place what a horrible place just let me get out of this boat and ill
never wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a river 
fear not  said a strange voice behind him frodo turned and saw strider
and yet not strider for the weatherworn ranger was no longer there in the
stern sat aragorn son of arathorn proud and erect guiding the boat with
skilful strokes his hood was cast back and his dark hair was blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a king returning from exile to his own land
fear not  he said long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildur and anárion my sires of old under their shadow elessar the
elfstone son of arathorn of the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendil
has nought to dread 
then the light of his eyes faded and he spoke to himself would that
gandalf were here how my heart yearns for minas anor and the walls of my own
city but whither now shall i go 
the chasm was long and dark and filled with the noise of wind and rushing
water and echoing stone it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all
was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall gap of light before him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through out into a wide clear
light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky the
pent waters spread out into a long oval lake pale nen hithoel fenced by steep
grey hills whose sides were clad with trees but their heads were bare
cold gleaming in the sunlight at the far southern end rose three peaks the
midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them an island
in the waters about which the flowing river flung pale shimmering arms distant
but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder
heard far away
behold tol brandir  said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak upon
the left stands amon lhaw and upon the right is amon hen the hills of hearing
and of sight in the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them
and watch was kept there but it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever
been set upon tol brandir ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them i
hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rested now for a while drifting south on the current that flowed
through the middle of the lake they ate some food and then they took to their
paddles and hastened on their way the sides of the westward hills fell into
shadow and the sun grew round and red here and there a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight rauros was roaring
with a great voice already night was laid on the flowing waters when the
travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was over wilderland was behind them they
could go no further without choice between the east way and the west the last
stage of the quest was before them
 
aragorn led them to the right arm of the river here upon its western side
under the shadow of tol brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet
of amon hen behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees
and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake a little
spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn this is the lawn of parth galen
a fair place in the summer days of old let us hope that no evil has yet come
here
they drew up their boats on the green banks and beside them they made their
camp they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies if gollum
had contrived to follow them he remained unseen and unheard nonetheless as the
night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing often in his sleep and waking in the
small hours he got up and came to frodo whose turn it was to watch
why are you waking  asked frodo it is not your watch
i do not know answered aragorn but a shadow and a threat has been
growing in my sleep it would be well to draw your sword
why  said frodo are enemies at hand 
let us see what sting may show answered aragorn
frodo then drew the elf blade from its sheath to his dismay the edges
gleamed dimly in the night orcs  he said not very near and yet too near
it seems
i feared as much said aragorn but maybe they are not on this side of the
river the light of sting is faint and it may point to no more than spies of
mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw i have never heard before of orcs
upon amon hen yet who knows what may happen in these evil days now that minas
tirith no longer holds secure the passages of anduin we must go warily
tomorrow
the day came like fire and smoke low in the east there were black bars of
cloud like the fumes of a great burning the rising sun lit them from beneath
with flames of murky red but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky the
summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold frodo looked out eastward and gazed
at the tall island its sides sprang sheer out of the running water high up
above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed mounting one
head above another and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock
crowned by a great spire of stone many birds were circling about it but no
sign of other living things could be seen
when they had eaten aragorn called the company together the day has come
at last he said the day of choice which we have long delayed what shall now
become of our company that has travelled so far in fellowship shall we turn
west with boromir and go to the wars of gondor or turn east to the fear and
shadow or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose whatever we do must be done soon we cannot long halt here the enemy is
on the eastern shore we know but i fear that the orcs may already be on this
side of the water
there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragorn at last i fear that the burden is laid upon
you you are the bearer appointed by the council your own way you alone can
choose in this matter i cannot advise you i am not gandalf and though i have
tried to bear his part i do not know what design or hope he had for this hour
if indeed he had any most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice
would still wait on you such is your fate
frodo did not answer at once then he spoke slowly i know that haste is
needed yet i cannot choose the burden is heavy give me an hour longer and i
will speak let me be alone 
aragorn looked at him with kindly pity very well frodo son of drogo he
said you shall have an hour and you shall be alone we will stay here for a
while but do not stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed sam who had been watching his
master with great concern shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now 
presently frodo got up and walked away and sam saw that while the others
restrained themselves and did not stare at him the eyes of boromir followed
frodo intently until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of amon
hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood frodo found that his feet were
leading him up towards the slopes of the hill he came to a path the dwindling
ruins of a road of long ago in steep places stairs of stone had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees for some while
he climbed not caring which way he went until he came to a grassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone the little
upland lawn was open upon the east and was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over the river far below him to tol brandir and
the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands staring
eastwards but seeing little with his eyes all that had happened since bilbo
left the shire was passing through his mind and he recalled and pondered
everything that he could remember of gandalfs words time went on and still he
was no nearer to a choice
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came to him that
something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him he sprang up and
turned but all that he saw to his surprise was boromir and his face was
smiling and kind
i was afraid for you frodo he said coming forward if aragorn is right
and orcs are near then none of us should wander alone and you least of all so
much depends on you and my heart too is heavy may i stay now and talk for a
while since i have found you it would comfort me where there are so many all
speech becomes a debate without end but two together may perhaps find wisdom
you are kind answered frodo but i do not think that any speech will help
me for i know what i should do but i am afraid of doing it boromir afraid
boromir stood silent rauros roared endlessly on the wind murmured in the
branches of the trees frodo shivered
suddenly boromir came and sat beside him are you sure that you do not
suffer needlessly  he said i wish to help you you need counsel in your hard
choice will you not take mine 
i think i know already what counsel you would give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning against what  said boromir sharply
against delay against the way that seems easier against refusal of the
burden that is laid on me against well if it must be said against trust in
the strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country
though you knew it not
i do not doubt the valour of your people but the world is changing the
walls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough if they
fail what then 
we shall fall in battle valiantly yet there is still hope that they will
not fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring  said boromir his eyes lighting the ring is it not a
strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing
so small a thing and i have seen it only for an instant in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it again 
frodo looked up his heart went suddenly cold he caught the strange gleam in
boromirs eyes yet his face was still kind and friendly it is best that it
should lie hidden he answered
as you wish i care not said boromir yet may i not even speak of it for
you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy of its evil
uses not of its good the world is changing you say minas tirith will fall if
the ring lasts but why certainly if the ring were with the enemy but why if
it were with us 
were you not at the council  answered frodo because we cannot use it
and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatiently so you go on he cried
gandalf elrond   all these folk have taught you to say so for themselves they
may be right these elves and half elves and wizards they would come to grief
perhaps yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid but each to
his own kind true hearted men they will not be corrupted we of minas tirith
have been staunch through long years of trial we do not desire the power of
wizard lords only strength to defend ourselves strength in a just cause and
behold in our need chance brings to light the  ring of power it is a gift i
say a gift to the foes of mordor it is mad not to use it to use the power of
the enemy against him the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve
victory what could not a warrior do in this hour a great leader what could
not aragorn do or if he refuses why not boromir the ring would give me power
of command how i would drive the hosts of mordor and all men would flock to my
banner
boromir strode up and down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to
have forgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons and the
mustering of men and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories
to be and he cast down mordor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and
wise suddenly he stopped and waved his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried i do not say destroy
it that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so it does not
the only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into
mordor and offer the enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself folly
surely you see it my friend he said turning now suddenly to frodo again
you say that you are afraid if it is so the boldest should pardon you but is
it not really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid said frodo simply afraid but i am glad to have heard
you speak so fully my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith  cried boromir his eyes were shining
and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least for a while  boromir persisted my city is
not far now and it is little further from there to mordor than from here we
have been long in the wilderness and you need news of what the enemy is doing
before you make a move come with me frodo he said you need rest before
your venture if go you must he laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement
he stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the tall man nearly twice his
height and many times his match in strength
why are you so unfriendly  said boromir i am a true man neither thief
nor tracker i need your ring that you know now but i give you my word that i
do not desire to keep it will you not at least let me make trial of my plan
lend me the ring 
no no  cried frodo the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly that the enemy will defeat us cried boromir how
it angers me fool obstinate fool running wilfully to death and ruining our
cause if any mortals have claim to the ring it is the men of númenor
and not halflings it is not yours save by unhappy chance it might have been
mine it should be mine give it to me 
frodo did not answer but moved away till the great flat stone stood between
them come come my friend  said boromir in a softer voice why not get rid
of it why not be free of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame on me if
you will you can say that i was too strong and took it by force for i am too
strong for you halfling he cried and suddenly he sprang over the stone and
leaped at frodo his fair and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging fire
was in his eyes
frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them there was only one
thing he could do trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly
slipped it on his finger even as boromir sprang at him again the man gasped
stared for a moment amazed and then ran wildly about seeking here and there
among the rocks and trees
miserable trickster he shouted let me get my hands on you now i see
your mind you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all you have only
waited your chance to leave us in the lurch curse you and all halflings to
death and darkness  then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling and
lay upon his face for a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck
him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his hand over his eyes dashing away the tears what have
i said  he cried what have i done frodo frodo  he called come back a
madness took me but it has passed come back 
there was no answer frodo did not even hear his cries he was already far
away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top terror and grief shook him
seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon hen and halted gasping for
breath he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle paved with mighty flags
and surrounded with a crumbling battlement and in the middle set upon four
carven pillars was a high seat reached by a stair of many steps up he went
and sat upon the ancient chair feeling like a lost child that had clambered
upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he could see little he seemed to be in a world of mist in which
there were only shadows the ring was upon him then here and there the mist
gave way and he saw many visions small and clear as if they were under his eyes
upon a table and yet remote there was no sound only bright living images the
world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent he was sitting upon the seat of
seeing on amon hen the hill of the eye of the men of númenor eastward
he looked into wide uncharted lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the great river lay like a ribbon beneath him and the
misty mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth westward he looked and saw
the broad pastures of rohan and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black
spike southward he looked and below his very feet the great river curled like
a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of rauros into a foaming pit a
glimmering rainbow played upon the fume and ethir anduin he saw the mighty
delta of the river and myriads of sea birds whirling like a white dust in the
sun and beneath them a green and silver sea rippling in endless lines
but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war the misty mountains were
crawling like anthills orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes under the
boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of elves and men and fell beasts the
land of the beornings was aflame a cloud was over moria smoke rose on the
borders of lórien
horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan wolves poured from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of war put out to sea and out of the east men
were moving endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of
chieftains and laden wains all the power of the dark lord was in motion then
turning south again he beheld minas tirith far away it seemed and beautiful
white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat its
battlements glittered with steel and its turrets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his heart but against minas tirith was set another fortress
greater and more strong thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn it
passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul and
the haunted mountains and it looked upon gorgoroth the valley of terror in the
land of mordor darkness lay there under the sun fire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek rising then at last his gaze was held
wall upon wall battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain
of iron gate of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad dûr fortress
of sauron all hope left him
and suddenly he felt the eye there was an eye in the dark tower that did not
sleep he knew that it had become aware of his gaze a fierce eager will was
there it leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it searching for
him very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was amon lhaw
it touched it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the seat
crouching covering his head with his grey hood
he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily i
come i come to you he could not tell then as a flash from some other
point of power there came to his mind another thought take it off take it
off fool take it off take off the ring
the two powers strove in him for a moment perfectly balanced between their
piercing points he writhed tormented suddenly he was aware of himself again
frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose and with one remaining
instant in which to do so he took the ring off his finger he was kneeling in
clear sunlight before the high seat a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm
above him it missed amon hen and groped out west and faded then all the sky
was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree
frodo rose to his feet a great weariness was on him but his will was firm
and his heart lighter he spoke aloud to himself i will do now what i must
he said this at least is plain the evil of the ring is already at work even
in the company and the ring must leave them before it does more harm i will go
alone some i cannot trust and those i can trust are too dear to me poor old
sam and merry and pippin strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and
he will be needed there now boromir has fallen into evil i will go alone at
once
he went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where boromir had
found him then he halted listening he thought he could hear cries and calls
from the woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said i wonder how long i have been away
hours i should think he hesitated what can i do  he muttered i must go
now or i shall never go i shant get a chance again i hate leaving them and
like this without any explanation but surely they will understand sam will
and what else can i do
slowly he drew out the ring and put it on once more he vanished and passed
down the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the river side for some time they had been
silent moving restlessly about but now they were sitting in a circle and they
were talking every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things of
their long road and many adventures they questioned aragorn concerning the
realm of gondor and its ancient history and the remnants of its great works
that could still be seen in this strange border land of the emyn muil the stone
kings and the seats of lhaw and hen and the great stair beside the falls of
rauros but always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is debating which course is the most desperate i think said aragorn
and well he may it is now more hopeless than ever for the company to go east
since we have been tracked by gollum and must fear that the secret of our
journey is already betrayed but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and the
destruction of the burden
we may remain there for a while and make a brave stand but the lord
denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond his
power either to keep the burden secret or to hold off the full might of the
enemy when he comes to take it which way would any of us choose in frodos
place i do not know now indeed we miss gandalf most
grievous is our loss said legolas yet we must needs make up our minds
without his aid why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us call him back
and then vote i should vote for minas tirith
and so should i said gimli we of course were only sent to help the
bearer along the road to go no further than we wished and none of us is under
any oath or command to seek mount doom hard was my parting from lothlórien
yet i have come so far and i say this now we have reached the last choice it
is clear to me that i cannot leave frodo i would choose minas tirith but if he
does not then i follow him
and i too will go with him said legolas it would be faithless now to say
farewell
it would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said aragorn but if he
goes east then all need not go with him nor do i think that all should that
venture is desperate as much so for eight as for three or two or one alone if
you would let me choose then i should appoint three companions sam who could
not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself boromir will return to his own
city where his father and his people need him and with him the others should
go or at least meriadoc and peregrin if legolas is not willing to leave us
that wont do at all  cried merry we cant leave frodo pippin and i
always intended to go wherever he went and we still do but we did not realize
what that would mean it seemed different so far away in the shire or in
rivendell it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor why cant we
stop him
we must stop him said pippin and that is what he is worrying about i am
sure he knows we shant agree to his going east and he doesnt like to ask
anyone to go with him poor old fellow imagine it going off to mordor alone 
pippin shuddered but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know that he
hasnt got to ask he ought to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave
him
begging your pardon said sam i dont think you understand my master at
all he isnt hesitating about which way to go of course not whats the good
of minas tirith anyway to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he
added and turned it was then that they discovered that boromir who at first
had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle was no longer there
now wheres he got to  cried sam looking worried hes been a bit queer
lately to my mind but anyway hes not in this business hes off to his home
as he always said and no blame to him but mr frodo he knows hes got to find
the cracks of doom if he can but hes afraid now its come to the
point hes just plain terrified thats what his trouble is of course hes had
a bit of schooling so to speak we all have since we left home or hed be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in the river and bolt but hes still too
frightened to start and he isnt worrying about us either whether well go
along with him or no he knows we mean to thats another thing thats bothering
him if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone mark my words were
going to have trouble when he comes back for hell screw himself up all right
as sure as his names baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn and
what shall we do if you prove right 
stop him dont let him go  cried pippin
i wonder  said aragorn he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is
on him i do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or the other
nor do i think that we should succeed if we tried there are other powers at
work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up and come back and let
us get it over said pippin this waiting is horrible surely the time is up

yes said aragorn the hour is long passed the morning is wearing away
we must call for him
at that moment boromir reappeared he came out from the trees and walked
towards them without speaking his face looked grim and sad he paused as if
counting those that were present and then sat down aloof with his eyes on the
ground
where have you been boromir  asked aragorn have you seen frodo 
boromir hesitated for a second yes and no he answered slowly yes i
found him some way up the hill and i spoke to him i urged him to come to minas
tirith and not to go east i grew angry and he left me he vanished i have
never seen such a thing happen before though i have heard of it in tales he
must have put the ring on i could not find him again i thought he would return
to you
is that all that you have to say  said aragorn looking hard and not too
kindly at boromir
yes he answered i will say no more yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up i dont know what this man has been up
to why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt ought to have and if he
has goodness knows what may have happened
but he wouldnt keep it on said merry not when he had escaped the
unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he  cried pippin hes been away ages now
how long is it since you saw frodo last boromir  asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered or it might be an hour i have wandered
for some time since i do not know i do not know  he put his head in his
hands and sat as if bowed with grief
an hour since he vanished  shouted sam we must try and find him at once
come on 
wait a moment  cried aragorn we must divide up into pairs and
arrange here hold on wait 
it was no good they took no notice of him sam had dashed off first merry
and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward into the trees
by the shore shouting frodo frodo in their clear high hobbit voices
legolas and gimli were running a sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen
on the company
we shall all be scattered and lost groaned aragorn boromir i do not
know what part you have played in this mischief but help now go after those
two young hobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him i shall return
soon
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam just as he reached
the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him toiling uphill panting and
calling frodo
come with me sam  he said none of us should be alone there is mischief
about i feel it i am going to the top to the seat of amon hen to see what
may be seen and look it is as my heart guessed frodo went this way follow
me and keep your eyes open  he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not keep up with strider the ranger and soon
fell behind he had not gone far before aragorn was out of sight ahead sam
stopped and puffed suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee  he said aloud your legs are too short so use your
head let me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way but he hasnt
told us everything something scared mr frodo badly he screwed himself up to
the point sudden he made up his mind at last to go where to off east not
without sam yes without even his sam thats hard cruel hard
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears steady gamgee
 he said think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump
waterfalls hes got no gear so hes got to get back to the boats back to the
boats back to the boats sam like lightning 
sam turned and bolted back down the path he fell and cut his knees up he
got and ran on he came to the edge of the lawn of parth galen by the shore
where the boats were drawn up out of the water no one was there there seemed
to be cries in the woods behind but he did not heed them he stood gazing for a
moment stock still gaping a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass the boat slipped into the water
coming mr frodo coming  called sam and flung himself from the bank
clutching at the departing boat he missed it by a yard with a cry and a splash
he fell face downward into deep swift water gurgling he went under and the
river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat a paddle swirled and the
boat put about frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the hair as he came up
bubbling and struggling fear was staring in his round brown eyes
up you come sam my lad  said frodo now take my hand 
save me mr frodo  gasped sam im drownded i cant see your hand
here it is dont pinch lad i wont let you go tread water and dont
flounder or youll upset the boat there now get hold of the side and let me
use the paddle 
with a few strokes frodo brought the boat back to the bank and sam was able
to scramble out wet as a water rat frodo took off the ring and stepped ashore
again
of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst sam  he said
oh mr frodo thats hard  said sam shivering thats hard trying to go
without me and all if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be now 
safely on my way
safely  said sam all alone and without me to help you i couldnt have a
borne it itd have been the death of me
it would be the death of you to come with me sam said frodo and i could
not have borne that
not as certain as being left behind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well enough mr frodo of course you are and im coming with
you
now sam said frodo dont hinder me the others will be coming back at
any minute if they catch me here i shall have to argue and explain and i
shall never have the heart or the chance to get off but i must go at once its
the only way
of course it is answered sam but not alone im coming too or neither
of us isnt going ill knock holes in all the boats first
frodo actually laughed a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart
leave one he said well need it but you cant come like this without your
gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eagerly its all
ready i thought we should be off today he rushed to the camping place fished
out his pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when he emptied the boat of
his companions goods grabbed a spare blanket and some extra packages of food
and ran back
so all my plan is spoilt  said frodo it is no good trying to escape you
but im glad sam i cannot tell you how glad come along it is plain that we
were meant to go together we will go and may the others find a safe road
strider will look after them i dont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo we may said sam
so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together frodo
paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away down the
western arm and past the frowning cliffs of tol brandir the roar of the great
falls drew nearer even with such help as sam could give it was hard work to
pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive the boat
eastward towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon lhaw
there they found a shelving shore and they drew the boat out high above the
water and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder then shouldering
their burdens they set off seeking a path that would bring them over the grey
hills of the emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
here ends the first part of the history of the war of the ring
aragorn sped on up the hill every now and again he bent to the ground
hobbits go light and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger to read
but not far from the top a spring crossed the path and in the wet earth he saw
what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself frodo ran to the hill-top i
wonder what he saw there but he returned by the same way and went down the
hill again
aragorn hesitated he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping to see
there something that would guide him in his perplexities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across the great flag-stones
and up the steps then sitting in the high seat he looked out but the sun
seemed darkened and the world dim and remote he turned from the north back
again to north and saw nothing save the distant hills unless it were that far
away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air descending
slowly in wide circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below on the
west side of the river he stiffened there were cries and among them to his
horror he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs then suddenly with a
deep-throated call a great horn blew and the blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromir he cried he is in need he sprang down the steps
and away leaping down the path alas an ill fate is on me this day and all
that i do goes amiss where is sam
as he ran the cries came louder but fainter now and desperately the horn was
blowing fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the
horn-calls ceased aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could reach
the hills foot the sounds died away and as he turned to the left and ran
towards them they retreated until at last he could hear them no more drawing
his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the
trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a little glade not far from the lake he
found boromir he was sitting with his back to a great tree as if he was
resting but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows
his sword was still in his hand but it was broken near the hilt his horn
cloven in two was at his side many orcs lay slain piled all about him and at
his feet
aragorn knelt beside him boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak at
last slow words came i tried to take the ring from frodo  he said i am
sorry i have paid his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least
lay there they have gone: the halflings: the orcs have taken them i think
they are not dead orcs bound them he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no said aragorn taking his hand and kissing his brow you have
conquered few have gained such a victory be at peace minas tirith shall not
fall
boromir smiled
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
alas said aragorn thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower of
guard this is a bitter end now the company is all in ruin it is i that have
failed vain was gandalfs trust in me what shall i do now boromir has laid it
on me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires it but where are the ring and
the bearer how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand so it
was that legolas and gimli found him they came from the western slopes of the
hill silently creeping through the trees as if they were hunting gimli had
his axe in hand and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent when
they came into the glade they halted in amazement and then they stood a moment
with heads bowed in grief for it seemed to them plain what had happened
alas said legolas coming to aragorns side we have hunted and slain
many orcs in the woods but we should have been of more use here we came when
we heard the horn-but too late it seems i fear you have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn i am unscathed for i was not here with
him he fell defending the hobbits while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cried gimli where are they then where is frodo
i do not know answered aragorn wearily before he died boromir told me
that the orcs had bound them he did not think that they were dead i sent him
to follow merry and pippin but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him:
not until it was too late all that i have done today has gone amiss what is to
be done now
first we must tend the fallen said legolas we cannot leave him lying
like carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimli he would not wish us to linger we must
follow the orcs if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners
but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not  said
aragorn are we to abandon him must we not seek him first an evil choice is
now before us
then let us do first what we must do said legolas we have not the time
or the tools to bury our comrade fitly or to raise a mound over him a cairn we
might build
the labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use
nearer than the water-side said gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons and the weapons of his
vanquished foes said aragorn we will send him to the falls of rauros and
give him to anduin the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil
creature dishonours his bones
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs gathering their swords and
cloven helms and shields into a heap see cried aragorn here we find
tokens he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives leaf-bladed
damasked in gold and red and searching further he found also the sheaths
black set with small red gems no orc-tools these he said they were borne
by the hobbits doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing them for what they are: work of westernesse wound about with
spells for the bane of mordor well now if they still live our friends are
weaponless i will take these things hoping against hope to give them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows that i can find for my
quiver is empty he searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not
a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs
were accustomed to use he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said: here lie many that are not
folk of mordor some are from the north from the misty mountains if i know
anything of orcs and their kinds and here are others strange to me their gear
is not after the manner of orcs at all
there were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature swart slant-eyed with
thick legs and large hands they were armed with short broad-bladed swords not
with the curved scimitars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew in length
and shape like the bows of men upon their shields they bore a strange device: a
small white hand in the centre of a black field on the front of their iron
helms was set an s-rune wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before said aragorn what do they mean
s is for sauron said gimli that is easy to read
nay said legolas sauron does not use the elf-runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit it to be spelt or spoken
said aragorn and he does not use white the orcs in the service of barad-dûr
use the sign of the red eye he stood for a moment in thought s is for
saruman i guess he said at length there is evil afoot in isengard and the
west is no longer safe it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of our journey it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs
fall pursuers from moria may have escaped the
vigilance of lórien or they may have avoided that land and come to
isengard by other paths orcs travel fast but saruman has many ways of learning
news do you remember the birds
well we have no time to ponder riddles said gimli let us bear boromir
away
but after that we must guess the riddles if we are to choose our course
rightly answered aragorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches these they lashed together
with bowstrings and spread their cloaks upon the frame upon this rough bier
they carried the body of their companion to the shore together with such
trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him it was only a
short way yet they found it no easy task for boromir was a man both tall and
strong
at the water-side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas and
gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen it was a mile or more and it was
some time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is a strange tale to tell said legolas there are only two boats
upon the bank we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli and orcs would have taken or
destroyed all the boats and the baggage as well
i will look at the ground when we come there said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and
placed beneath his head they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his
shoulders the golden belt of lórien gleamed about his waist his helm
they set beside him and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts
and shards of his sword beneath his feet they put the swords of his
enemies then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat they drew him
out into the water they rowed sadly along the shore and turning into the
swift-running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen the steep
sides of tol brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon as they went south
the fume of rauros rose and shimmered before them a haze of gold the rush and
thunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there boromir lay restful
peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water the stream took him while
they held their own boat back with their paddles he floated by them and slowly
his boat departed waning to a dark spot against the golden light and then
suddenly it vanished rauros roared on unchanging the river had taken boromir
son of denethor and he was not seen again in minas tirith standing as he used
to stand upon the white tower in the morning but in gondor in after-days it
long was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and bore
him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths of anduin out into the
great sea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him then
aragorn spoke they will look for him from the white tower he said but he
will not return from mountain or from sea then slowly he began to sing:
through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows

the west wind comes walking and about the walls it goes

what news from the west o wandering wind do you bring to me tonight

have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight

i saw him ride over seven streams over waters wide and grey

i saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away

into the shadows of the north i saw him then no more

the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor

o boromir from the high walls westward i looked afar

but you came not from the empty lands where no men are
then legolas sang:
from the mouths of the sea the south wind flies from the sandhills and
the stones

the wailing of the gulls it bears and at the gate it moans

what news from the south o sighing wind do you bring to me at eve

where now is boromir the fair he tarries and i grieve

ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie

on the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky

so many have passed down anduin to find the flowing sea

ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me

o boromir beyond the gate the seaward road runs south

but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again:
from the gate of kings the north wind rides and past the roaring falls

and clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls

what news from the north o mighty wind do you bring to me today

what news of boromir the bold for he is long away

beneath amon hen i heard his cry there many foes he fought

his cloven shield his broken sword they to the water brought

his head so proud his face so fair his limbs they laid to rest

and rauros golden rauros-falls bore him upon its breast

o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze

to rauros golden rauros-falls until the end of days
so they ended then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed
they could against the stream back to parth galen
you left the east wind to me said gimli but i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aragorn in minas tirith they endure the
east wind but they do not ask it for tidings but now boromir has taken his
road and we must make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the
earth the orcs have been on this ground he said otherwise nothing can be
made out for certain all our footprints are here crossing and re-crossing i
cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for frodo
began he returned to the bank close to where the rill from the spring
trickled out into the river there are some clear prints here he said a
hobbit waded out into the water and back but i cannot say how long ago
how then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn did not answer at once but went back to the camping-place and looked
at the baggage two packs are missing he said and one is certainly sams:
it was rather large and heavy this then is the answer: frodo has gone by boat
and his servant has gone with him frodo must have returned while we were all
away i met sam going up the hill and told him to follow me but plainly he did
not do so he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had
gone he did not find it easy to leave sam behind
but why should he leave us behind and without a word said gimli that
was a strange deed
and a brave deed said aragorn sam was right i think frodo did not wish
to lead any friend to death with him in mordor but he knew that he must go
himself something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs what he
thought was the cause of frodos sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir he long kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said legolas: frodo is no longer on
this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat and sam is with him
only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take the remaining boat and
follow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot there is little hope either
way we have already lost precious hours
let me think said aragorn and now may i make a right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment i will follow
the orcs he said at last i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him now in the wilderness i must abandon the
captives to torment and death my heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the
bearer is in my hands no longer the company has played its part yet we that
remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left come we will
go now leave all that can be spared behind we will press on by day and dark
they drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees they laid beneath it
such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away then they
left parth galen the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where
boromir had fallen there they picked up the trail of the orcs it needed little
skill to find
no other folk make such a trampling said legolas it seems their delight
to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all that said aragorn and they do not
tire and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands
well after them said gimli dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not
tire sooner than orcs but it will be a long chase: they have a long start
yes said aragorn we shall all need the endurance of dwarves but come
with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies and woe to
them if we prove the swifter we will make such a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel among the three kindreds µ elves dwarves and men forth the three
hunters
like a deer he sprang away through the trees he sped on and on he led them
tireless and swift now that his mind was at last made up the woods about the
lake they left behind long slopes they climbed dark hard-edged against the
sky already red with sunset dusk came they passed away grey shadows in a
stony land
 
dusk deepened mist lay behind them among the trees below and brooded on the
pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear stars came out the waxing
moon was riding in the west and the shadows of the rocks were black they had
come to the feet of stony hills and their pace was slower for the trail was no
longer easy to follow here the highlands of the emyn muil ran from north to
south in two long tumbled ridges the western side of each ridge was steep and
difficult but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and
narrow ravines all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land
climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge and down again into the
darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space the
moon had long gone down before them the stars glittered above them the first
light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind for the moment aragorn
was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley but there it had
vanished
which way would they turn do you think said legolas northward to take a
straighter road to isengard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guess or
southward to strike the entwash
they will not make for the river whatever mark they aim at said aragorn
and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatly
increased they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of
the rohirrim let us search northwards
the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills and a trickling
stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom a cliff frowned upon their
right to their left rose grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night they
went on for a mile or more northwards aragorn was searching bent towards the
ground among the folds and gullies leading up into the western ridge legolas
was some way ahead suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running
towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had at first taken to be
boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies five dead orcs lay
there they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli but it needs the light of day and for
that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas enemies of
the orcs are likely to be our friends do any folk dwell in these hills
no said aragorn the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from minas
tirith it might be that some company of men were hunting here for reasons that
we do not know yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far away among the slain are none of the great
orcs with the strange badges there was a quarrel i guess: it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk maybe there was some dispute about the road
or about the captives said gimli let us hope that they too did not
meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but no other traces of the
fight could be found they went on already the eastward sky was turning pale
the stars were fading and a grey light was slowly growing a little further
north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a
stony path down into the valley in it some bushes grew and there were patches
of grass upon its sides
at last said aragorn here are the tracks that we seek up this
water-channel: this is the way that the orcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path as if fresh from a
nights rest they sprang from stone to stone at last they reached the crest of
the grey hill and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks:
the chill wind of dawn
turning back they saw across the river the far hills kindled day leaped into
the sky the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land before
them in the west the world lay still formless and grey but even as they
looked the shadows of night melted the colours of the waking earth returned:
green flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white mists shimmered in the
watervales and far off to the left thirty leagues or more blue and purple
stood the white mountains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering
snows flushed with the rose of morning
gondor gondor cried aragorn would that i looked on you again in happier
hour not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountains and the sea

west wind blew there the light upon the silver tree

fell like bright rain in gardens of the kings of old

o proud walls white towers o winged crown and throne of gold

o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver tree

or west wind blow again between the mountains and the sea
now let us go he said drawing his eyes away from the south and looking
out west and north to the way that he must tread
the ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their
feet below it twenty fathoms or more there was a wide and rugged shelf which
ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the east wall of rohan so ended
the emyn muil and the green plains of the rohirrim stretched away before them
to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them there is
the eagle again he is very high he seems to be flying now away from this land
back to the north he is going with great speed look
no not even my eyes can see him my good legolas said aragorn he must
be far aloft indeed i wonder what is his errand if he is the same bird that i
have seen before but look i can see something nearer at hand and more urgent
there is something moving over the plain
many things said legolas it is a great company on foot but i cannot say
more nor see what kind of folk they may be they are many leagues away: twelve
i guess but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way
to go said gimli let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orcs chose
said aragorn
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day it seemed that the
orcs had pressed on with all possible speed every now and again the pursuers
found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags the rinds and crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the
stones the trail led them north along the top of the escarpment and at length
they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily
down in the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the
plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan it
swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the emyn muil the falling
stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants and they could
hear it tinkling away in green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens
of entwash vale far away they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills
behind here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented as if spring
was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf legolas
took a deep breath like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in
barren places
ah the green smell he said it is better than much sleep let us run
light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn more swiftly maybe than
iron-shod orcs now we have a chance to lessen their lead
they went in single file running like hounds on a strong scent and an eager
light was in their eyes nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had been bruised and blackened
as they passed presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside stay he
shouted do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the right away from the main
trail for he had seen footprints that went that way branching off from the
others the marks of small unshod feet these however did not go far before
they were crossed by orc-prints also coming out from the main trail behind and
in front and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the
trampling at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something from
the grass then he ran back
yes he said they are quite plain: a hobbits footprints pippins i
think he is smaller than the other and look at this he held up a thing that
glittered in the sunlight it looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree
fair and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven-cloak cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves of lórien fall said aragorn this did not
drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow i
think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli and he had the use of his wits
and of his legs too that is heartening we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle
burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky light clouds
came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
the sun sank shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east still
the hunters held on one day now had passed since boromir fell and the orcs
were yet far ahead no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level
plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted only twice in the days
march had they rested for a brief while and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he said shall we rest by night or
shall we go on while our will and strength hold
unless our enemies rest also they will leave us far behind if we stay to
sleep said legolas surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun yet these have done so
said legolas certainly they will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left as far as my eyes
can see said legolas
maybe i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line said
aragorn but if we strayed or they turned aside then when light came there
might be long delay before the trail was found again
and there is this also said gimli: only by day can we see if any tracks
lead away if a prisoner should escape or if one should be carried off
eastward say to the great river towards mordor we might pass the signs and
never know it
that is true said aragorn but if i read the signs back yonder rightly
the orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company is now bound for
isengard their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli and what of
escape in the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard since then and the prisoners even
wearier said legolas there will be no escape again if we do not contrive
it how that is to be done cannot be guessed but first we must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and not the least hardy of my folk
cannot run all the way to isengard without any pause  said gimli my heart
burns me too and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to
run the better and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn how shall we end this
debate
you are our guide said gimli and you are skilled in the chase you shall
choose
my heart bids me go on said legolas but we must hold together i will
follow your counsel
you give the choice to an ill chooser said aragorn since we passed
through the argonath my choices have gone amiss he fell silent gazing north
and west into the gathering night for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said at length the peril of missing the
trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater if the moon
gave enough light we would use it but alas he sets early and is yet young and
pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured would that the lady had
given us a light such a gift as she gave to frodo
it will be more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn with him lies
the true quest ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time a
vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice of mine can mar or mend
well i have chosen so let us use the time as best we may
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep for he had not
slept since their night under the shadow of tol brandir before dawn was in the
sky he woke and rose gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing northwards into the darkness thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a
windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn i know in my
heart that they have not rested this night only an eagle could overtake them
now
nonetheless we will still follow as we may said aragorn stooping he
roused the dwarf come we must go he said the scent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli even legolas on a hill-top could not see
them till the sun is up
i fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain under moon or
sun said legolas
where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn the land
must groan under their hated feet he stretched himself upon the ground with
his ear pressed against the turf he lay there motionless for so long a time
that gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again dawn came
glimmering and slowly a grey light grew about them at last he rose and now
his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn and his look was
troubled
the rumour of the earth is dim and confused he said nothing walks upon
it for many miles about us faint and far are the feet of our enemies but loud
are the hoofs of the horses it comes to my mind that i heard them even as i
lay on the ground in sleep and they troubled my dreams: horses galloping
passing in the west but now they are drawing ever further from us riding
northward i wonder what is happening in this land
let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began during all its long hours of cloud
and fitful sun they hardly paused now striding now running as if no weariness
could quench the fire that burned them they seldom spoke over the wide
solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the background of the
grey-green fields even in the cool sunlight of
mid-day few but elvish eyes would have marked them until they were close at
hand often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lórien for the gift
of lembas for they could eat of it and find new strength even as
they ran
all day the track of their enemies led straight on going north-west without
a break or turn as once again the day wore to its end they came to long
treeless slopes where the land rose swelling up towards a line of low
humpbacked downs ahead the orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards
them for the ground became harder and the grass shorter far away to the left
the river entwash wound a silver thread in a green floor no moving thing could
be seen often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man the
dwellings of the rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the south
under the wooded eaves of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud yet
the horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the eastemnet this
easterly region of their realm and there the herdsmen had wandered much living
in camp and tent even in winter-time but now all the land was empty and there
was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the
plains of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the shadows of the
east the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky but it gave small light and
the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase  said legolas
the orcs have run before us as if the very whips of sauron were behind them i
fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills and even now are
passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground his teeth this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our
toil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn we shall not turn back
here yet i am weary he gazed back along the way that they had come towards
the night gathering in the east there is something strange at work in this
land i distrust the silence i distrust even the pale moon the stars are
faint and i am weary as i have seldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow there is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than
in the limb
truly said legolas that i have known since first we came down from the
emyn muil for the will is not behind us but before us he pointed away over
the land of rohan into the darkling west under the sickle moon saruman
muttered aragorn but he shall not turn us back halt we must once more for
see even the moon is falling into gathering cloud but north lies our road
between down and fen when day returns
as before legolas was first afoot if indeed he had ever slept awake
awake he cried it is a red dawn strange things await us by the eaves of the
forest good or evil i do not know but we are called awake
the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again slowly the downs
drew near it was still an hour before noon when they reached them: green slopes
rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the north at their
feet the ground was dry and the turf short but a long strip of sunken land
some ten miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim
thickets of reed and rush just to the west of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc-trail ran out again turning north along the dry skirts of the
hills aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the outward trail is already
old i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas: it is thrice twelve hours i
guess since the orcs stood where we now stand if they held to their pace then
at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn
i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist said
gimli could we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn if i remember rightly these downs run
eight leagues or more to the north and then north-west to the issuing of the
entwash there lies still a wide land another fifteen leagues it may be
well let us go on said gimli my legs must forget the miles they would
be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of
downs for many hours they had marched without rest they were going slowly now
and gimlis back was bent stone-hard are the dwarves in labour or journey but
this endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and again to scan some
print or mark upon the ground only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever
his feet hardly seeming to press the grass leaving no footprints as he passed
but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed and
he could sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting his mind in the
strange paths of elvish dreams even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this
world
let us go up on to this green hill he said wearily they followed him
climbing the long slope until they came out upon the top it was a round hill
smooth and bare standing by itself the most northerly of the downs the sun
sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain they were alone in a grey
formless world without mark or measure only far away north-west there was a
deeper darkness against the dying light: the mountains of mist and the forest at
their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli well now we must halt
again and wear the night away it is growing cold
the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said legolas but rest if you
must yet do not cast all hope away tomorrow is unknown rede oft is found at
the rising of the sun
three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel  said
gimli
the night grew ever colder aragorn and gimli slept fitfully and whenever
they awoke they saw legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro singing
softly to himself in his own tongue and as he sang the white stars opened in
the hard black vault above so the night passed together they watched the dawn
grow slowly in the sky now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear the wind was in the east and all the mists had rolled
away wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the wold of rohan that they
had already glimpsed many days ago from the great river north-westward stalked
the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves and
its further slopes faded into the distant blue beyond there glimmered far away
as if floating on a grey cloud the white head of tall methedras the last peak
of the misty mountains out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them its
stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep-cloven the orc-trail turned
from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river and then the river back
towards the forest aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green a dark
swift-moving blur he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently
but legolas stood beside him shading his bright elven-eyes with his long
slender hand and he saw not a shadow nor a blur but the small figures of
horsemen many horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears
was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight far behind
them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
there was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli could hear the air moving
in the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet many riders on swift steeds
are coming towards us
yes said legolas there are one hundred and five yellow is their hair
and bright are their spears their leader is very tall
aragorn smiled keen are the eyes of the elves he said
nay the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leagues or one said gimli we cannot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them here or go on our way
we will wait said aragorn i am weary and our hunt has failed or at
least others were before us for these horsemen are riding back down the
orc-trail we may get new s from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn but evil or
good we will await it here
the three companions now left the hill-top where they might be an easy mark
against the pale sky and they walked slowly down the northward slope a little
above the hills foot they halted and wrapping their cloaks about them they
sat huddled together upon the faded grass the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching gimli was uneasy
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said do we sit here
waiting for sudden death
i have been among them answered aragorn they are proud and wilful but
they are true-hearted generous in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise
but unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after the manner of the
children of men before the dark years but i do not know what has happened here
of late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman
and the threat of sauron they have long been the friends of the people of
gondor though they are not akin to them it was in forgotten years long ago
that eorl the young brought them out of the north and their kinship is rather
with the bardings of dale and with the beornings of the wood among whom may
still be seen many men tall and fair as are the riders of rohan at least they
will not love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor  said gimli
i believe it no more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth said legolas already they approach
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs the
horsemen following the trail had turned from the river and were drawing near
the downs they were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields suddenly
they swept up with a noise like thunder and the foremost horseman swerved
passing by the foot of the hill and leading the host back southward along the
western skirts of the downs after him they rode: a long line of mail-clad men
swift shining fell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong and clean-limbed their grey coats
glistened their long tails flowed in the wind their manes were braided on
their proud necks the men that rode them matched them well: tall and
long-limbed their hair flaxen-pale flowed under their light helms and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces were stern and keen in their
hands were tall spears of ash painted shields were slung at their backs long
swords were at their belts their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their
knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and then one rose in his
stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side they appeared not to perceive the
three strangers sitting silently and watching them the host had almost passed
when suddenly aragorn stood up and called in a loud voice:
what news from the north riders of rohan
with astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds wheeled and came
charging round soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen
moving in a running circle up the hill-slope behind them and down round and
round them and drawing ever inwards aragorn stood silent and the other two
sat without moving wondering what way things would turn
without a word or cry suddenly the riders halted a thicket of spears were
pointed towards the strangers and some of the horsemen had bows in hand and
their arrows were already fitted to the string then one rode forward a tall
man taller than all the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail
flowed he advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of aragorns
breast aragorn did not stir
who are you and what are you doing in this land said the rider using the
common speech of the west in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man
of gondor
i am called strider answered aragorn i came out of the north i am
hunting orcs
the rider leaped from his horse giving his spear to another who rode up and
dismounted at his side he drew his sword and stood face to face with aragorn
surveying him keenly and not without wonder at length he spoke again
at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he said but now i see
that it is not so indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them in
this fashion they were swift and well-armed and they were many you would have
changed from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them but there is
something strange about you strider he bent his clear bright eyes again upon
the ranger that is no name for a man that you give and strange too is your
raiment have you sprung out of the grass how did you escape our sight are you
elvish folk
no said aragorn one only of us is an elf legolas from the woodland
realm in distant mirkwood but we have passed through lothlórien and the
gifts and favour of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder but his eyes hardened then
there is a lady in the golden wood as old tales tell he said few escape her
nets they say these are strange days but if you have her favour then you
also are net-weavers and sorcerers maybe he turned a cold glance suddenly
upon legolas and gimli why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the handle of
his axe and his dark eyes flashed give me your name horse-master and i will
give you mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring down at the dwarf the stranger
should declare himself first yet i am named éomer son of éomund
and am called the third marshal of riddermark
then éomer son of éomund third marshal of riddermark let
gimli the dwarf glóins son warn you against foolish words you speak
evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought and only little wit
can excuse you
éomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured angrily and closed
in advancing their spears i would cut off your head beard and all master
dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground  said éomer
he stands not alone said legolas bending his bow and fitting an arrow
with hands that moved quicker than sight you would die before your stroke
fell
éomer raised his sword and things might have gone ill but aragorn
sprang between them and raised his hand your pardon éomer he cried
when you know more you will understand why you have angered my
companions we intend no evil to rohan nor to any of its folk neither to man
nor to horse will you not hear our tale before you strike
i will said éomer lowering his blade but wanderers in the
riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt first tell
me your right name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn are you friend or foe of
sauron the dark lord of mordor
i serve only the lord of the mark théoden king son of thengel
answered éomer we do not serve the power of the black land far away
but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you are fleeing from him
then you had best leave this land there is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and to live as we have lived
keeping our own and serving no foreign lord good or evil we welcomed guests
kindly in the better days but in these times the unbidden stranger finds us
swift and hard come who are you whom do you serve at whose command do
you hunt orcs in our land
i serve no man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i pursue into
whatever land they may go there are few among mortal men who know more of orcs
and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice the orcs whom we pursued
took captive two of my friends in such need a man that has no horse will go on
foot and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail nor will he count the
heads of the enemy save with a sword i am not weaponless
aragorn threw back his cloak the elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it
and the bright blade of andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it
out elendil he cried i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dúnadan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor here
is the sword that was broken and is forged again will you aid me or thwart me
choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for they had not
seen him in this mood before he seemed to have
grown in stature while éomer had shrunk and in his living face they
caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone for a
moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows
of aragorn like a shining crown
éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face he cast down his
proud eyes these are indeed strange days he muttered dreams and legends
spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brings you here and what was the meaning of
the dark words long has boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer
and the horse that we lent him came back riderless what doom do you bring out
of the north
the doom of choice said aragorn you may say
this to théoden son of thengel: open war lies before him with sauron or
against him none may live now as they have lived and few shall keep what they
call their own but of these great matters we will speak later if chance
allows i will come myself to the king now i am in great need and i ask
for help or at least for tidings you heard that we are pursuing an orc-host
that carried off our friends what can you tell us
that you need not pursue them further said éomer the orcs are
destroyed
and our friends
we found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn did you search the slain were
there no bodies other than those of orc-kind they would be small only children
to your eyes unshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarves nor children said
éomer we counted all the slain and despoiled them and then we piled
the carcases and burned them as is our custom the ashes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwarves or children said gimli our friends were
hobbits
hobbits said éomer and what may they be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimli but these were very dear to
us it seems that you have heard in rohan of the words that troubled minas
tirith they spoke of the halfling these hobbits are halflings
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside éomer halflings
but they are only a little people in old songs and childrens tales out of the
north do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight
a man may do both said aragorn for not we but those who come after will
make the legends of our time the green earth say you that is a mighty matter
of legend though you tread it under the light of day
time is pressing said the rider not heeding aragorn we must hasten
south lord let us leave these wild folk to their fancies or let us bind them
and take them to the king
peace éothain said éomer in his own tongue leave me a
while tell the éored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to the entwade
muttering éothain retired and spoke to the others soon they drew off
and left éomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn he said yet you speak the truth
that is plain: the men of the mark do not lie and therefore they are not easily
deceived but you have not told all will you not now speak more fully of your
errand so that i may judge what to do
i set out from imladris as it is named in the rhyme many weeks ago
answered aragorn with me went boromir of minas tirith my errand was to go to
that city with the son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the company that i journeyed with had other business of that i cannot speak
now gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf éomer exclaimed gandalf greyhame is known in the mark:
but his name i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour he has
been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men coming as he will
after a season or after many years he is ever the herald of strange
events: a bringer of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss at
that time our trouble with saruman began until then we counted saruman our
friend hut gandalf came then and warned us that
sudden war was preparing in isengard he said that he himself had been a
prisoner in orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged for help but théoden
would not listen to him and he went away speak not the name of gandalf loudly
in théodens ears he is wroth for gandalf took the horse that is called
shadowfax the most precious of all the kings steeds chief of the mearas
which only the lord of the mark may ride for the sire of their race was the
great horse of eorl that knew the speech of men seven nights ago shadowfax
returned but the kings anger is not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle him
then shadowfax has found his way alone from the far north said aragorn
for it was there that he and gandalf parted but alas gandalf will ride no
longer he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said éomer at least to me and to many
though not to all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand though it
may touch them sorely ere the year is much older said aragorn but when the
great fall the less must lead my part it has been to guide our company on the
long road from moria through lórien we came
- of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it
again - and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed
your news is all of woe cried éomer in
dismay great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all that was a
worthy man all spoke his praise he came seldom to the mark for he was ever in
the wars on the east-borders but i have seen him more like to the swift
sons of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and likely to
prove a great captain of his people when his time came but we have had no word
of this grief out of gondor when did he fall
it is now the fourth day since he was slain answered aragorn and since
the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of tol brandir
on foot cried éomer
yes even as you see us
wide wonder came into éomers eyes strider is too poor a name son
of arathorn he said wingfoot i name you this deed of the three
friends should be sung in many a hall forty leagues and five you have measured
ere the fourth day is ended hardy is the race of elendil
but now lord what would you have me do i must return in haste to théoden
i spoke warily before my men it is true that we are not yet at open war
with the black land and there are some close to the kings ear that speak
craven counsels but war is coming we shall not forsake our old alliance with
gondor and while they fight we shall aid them: so say i and all who hold with
me the east-mark is my charge the ward of the third marshal and i have
removed all our herds and herdfolk withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving
none here but guards and swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not and we never have said éomer with a flash of his eyes
though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told some years ago the lord
of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use then he sent plundering orcs and
they carry off what they can choosing always the black horses: few of these are
now left for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concern is with saruman he has claimed lordship
over all this land and there has been war between us for many months he has
taken orcs into his service and wolf-riders and evil men and he has closed
the gap against us so that we are likely to be beset both east and west
it is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and
dwimmer-crafty having many guises he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall his spies slip
through every net and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky i do not
know how it will all end and my heart misgives me for it seems to me that his
friends do not all dwell in isengard but if you come to the kings house you
shall see for yourself will you not come do i hope in vain that you have been
sent to me for a help in doubt and need
i will come when i may said aragorn
come now said éomer the heir of elendil would be a strength
indeed to the sons of eorl in this evil tide there is battle even now
upon the westemnet and i fear that it may go ill for us
indeed in this riding north i went without the kings leave for in my
absence his house is left with little guard but scouts warned me of the
orc-host coming down out of the east wall three nights ago and among them they
reported that some bore the white badges of saruman so suspecting what i most
fear a league between orthanc and the dark tower i led forth my éored
men of my own household and we overtook the orcs at nightfall two days ago
near to the borders of the entwood there we surrounded them and gave battle
yesterday at dawn fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas for the
orcs were greater in number than we counted on others joined them coming out
of the east across the great river: their trail is plain to see a little north
of this spot and others too came out of the forest great orcs who also bore
the white hand of isengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all others
nonetheless we put an end to them but we have been too long away we are
needed south and west will you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do yes and we could find a use for gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of
the wood i spoke only as do all men in my land and i would gladly learn
better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn and my heart desires to
come with you but i cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said éomer you will not find your friends on
the north-borders
yet my friends are not behind we found a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there but between the wall and
the downs we have found no other trace of them and no trail has turned aside
this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become of them
i do not know they may have been slain and burned among the orcs but that
you will say cannot be and i do not fear it i can only think that they were
carried off into the forest before the battle even before you encircled your
foes maybe can you swear that none escaped your net in such a way
i would swear that no orc escaped after we
sighted them said éomer we reached the forest-eaves before them and
if after that any living thing broke through our ring then it was no orc and
had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said aragorn and you passed us
by under the full light of day
i had forgotten that said éomer it is hard to be sure of anything
among so many marvels the world is all grown strange elf and dwarf in company
walk in our daily fields and folk speak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword comes back to war that was broken in the long ages ere
the fathers of our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man judge what to do
in such times
as he ever has judged said aragorn good and ill have not changed since
yesteryear nor are they one thing among elves and dwarves µ and another among
men it is a mans part to discern them as much in the golden wood as in his
own house
true indeed said éomer but i do not doubt you nor the deed which
my heart would do yet i am not free to do all as i would it is against
our law to let strangers wander at will in our land until the king himself
shall give them leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril i
have begged you to come back willingly with me and you will not loth am i to
begin a battle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for such a chance said aragorn nor
indeed am i a stranger for i have been in this land before more than once and
ridden with the host of the rohirrim though under
other name and in other guise you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have spoken with éomund your father and with théoden son of
thengel never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained
a man to abandon such a quest as mine my duty at least is clear to go on come
now son of éomund the choice must be made at last aid us or at the
worst let us go free or seek to carry out your law if you do so there will be
fewer to return to your war or to your king
éomer was silent for a moment then he spoke we both have need of
haste he said my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your
hope this is my choice you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask: when your quest is achieved or is proved vain return with the
horses over the entwade to meduseld the high house in edoras where théoden
now sits thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged in this i place
myself and maybe my very life in the keeping of your good faith do not
fail
i will not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances among his men
when éomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the
strangers but only éothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the race of gondor as he claims he
said but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a dwarf
no one said gimli and do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it i
would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great free or
begrudged
but you must ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legolas then all will be
well and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark-grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it hasufel
is his name said éomer may he bear you well and to better fortune
than gárulf his late master
a smaller and lighter horse but restive and fiery was brought to legolas
arod was his name but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein i need
them not he said and leaped lightly up and to their wonder arod was tame and
willing beneath him moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the
elvish way with all good beasts gimli was lifted up behind his friend and he
clung to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek cried éomer return with
what speed you may and let our swords hereafter shine together
i will come said aragorn
and i will come too said gimli the matter of the lady galadriel lies
still between us i have yet to teach you gentle speech 
we shall see said éomer so many strange things have chanced that
to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarfs
axe will seem no great wonder farewell
with that they parted very swift were the horses of rohan when after a
little gimli looked back the company of éomer were already small and far
away aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on their
way bending low with his head beside the neck of hasufel before long they came
to the borders of the entwash and there they met the other trail of which
éomer had spoken coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into the
saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keeping to one side and taking
care not to override the footprints then he again dismounted and examined the
ground going backwards and forwards on foot
there is little to discover he said when he returned the main trail is
all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back their outward
course must have lain nearer the river but this eastward trail is fresh and
clear there is no sign there of any feet going the other way back towards
anduin now we must ride slower and make sure that no trace or footstep
branches off on either side the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were pursued they may have made some attempt to get their captives away
before they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast low grey clouds came over the
wold a mist shrouded the sun ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of fangorn
loomed slowly darkling as the sun went west they saw no sign of any trail to
right or left but here and there they passed single orcs fallen in their
tracks as they ran with grey-feathered arrows sticking in back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest and
in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great
burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking beside it was a great pile of
helms and mail cloven shields and broken swords bows and darts and other gear
of war upon a stake in the middle was set a great goblin head upon its
shattered helm the white badge could still be seen further away not far from
the river where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a
mound it was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves:
about it were planted fifteen spears
aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle
but the light faded and evening soon drew down dim and misty by nightfall
they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly we have been set many riddles since
we came to tol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel i would guess that
the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs it will be hard
news for frodo if he lives to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who
waits in rivendell elrond was against their coming
but gandalf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the first to be lost 
answered gimli his foresight failed him
the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety for
himself or for others said aragorn there are some things that it is better
to begin than to refuse even though the end may be dark but i shall not depart
from this place yet in any case we must here await the morning-light
a little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading
tree: it looked like a chestnut and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves
of a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers they rattled
mournfully in the night-breeze
gimli shivered they had brought only one blanket apiece let us light a
fire he said i care no longer for the danger let the orcs come as thick as
summer-moths round a candle
if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods it might draw them
hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn we
are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman also we are on the very
edge of fangorn and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood it is
said
but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday said gimli and they
felled trees for the fire as can be seen yet they passed the night after
safely here when their labour was ended
they were many said aragorn and they do not heed the wrath of fangorn
for they come here seldom and they do not go under the trees but our paths are
likely to lead us into the very forest itself so have a care cut no living
wood
there is no need said gimli the riders have left chip and bough enough
and there is dead wood lying in plenty he went off to gather fuel and busied
himself with building and kindling a fire but aragorn sat silent with his back
to the great tree deep in thought and legolas stood alone in the open looking
towards the profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who listens to
voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going the three companions drew
close to it and sat together shrouding the light with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look he said the tree is glad of the fire
it may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so
as to come above the flames while the upper branches were stooping down the
brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like many cold cracked
hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown forest so near at
hand made itself felt as a great brooding presence full of secret purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he said do you know why
aragorn what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard
i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i should deem them only fables that men have
made as true knowledge fades i had thought of asking you what was the truth of
the matter and if an elf of the wood does not know how shall a man answer
you have journeyed further than i said legolas i have heard nothing of
this in my own land save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men call
ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old old even as the elves would
reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as old as the forest by the barrow-downs
and it is far greater elrond says that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the mighty woods of the elder days in which the firstborn roamed while men
still slept yet fangorn holds some secret of its own what it is i do not
know
and i do not wish to know said gimli let nothing that dwells in fangorn
be troubled on my account
they now drew lots for the watches and the lot for the first watch fell to
gimli the others lay down almost at once sleep laid hold on them gimli
said aragorn drowsily remember it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a
living tree in fangorn but do not stray far in search of dead wood let the
fire die rather call me at need
with that he fell asleep legolas already lay motionless his fair hands
folded upon his breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb
thoughtfully along the edge of his axe the tree rustled there was no other
sound
suddenly gimli looked up and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood
an old bent man leaning on a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his
wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes gimli sprang up too amazed for
the moment to cry out though at once the thought flashed into his mind that
saruman had caught them both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden
movement sat up and stared the old man did not speak or make sign
well father what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode forward but the old man was
gone there was no trace of him to be found near at hand and they did not dare
to wander far the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry the horses the horses
the horses were gone they had dragged their pickets and disappeared for me
time the three companions stood still and silent troubled by this new stroke of
ill fortune they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless leagues lay
between them and the men of rohan their only friends in this wide and dangerous
land as they stood it seemed to them that they heard far off in the night
the sound of horses whinnying and neighing then all was quiet again except for
the cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last we cannot find them or catch
them so that if they do not return of their own will we must do without we
started on our feet and we have those still
feet said gimli but we cannot eat them as well as walk on them  he
threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of rohan laughed
legolas you will make a rider yet
it seems unlikely that i shall have the chance said gimli
if you wish to know what i think he began again after a while i think it
was saruman who else remember the words of éomer: he walks about like
an old man hooded and cloaked those were the words he has gone off with our
horses or scared them away and here we are there is more trouble
coming to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn but i marked also that this old man had a hat
not a hood still i do not doubt that you guess right and that we are in peril
here by night or day yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but
rest while we may i will watch for a while now gimli i have more need of
thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly legolas followed aragorn and gimli followed
legolas and their watches wore away but nothing happened the old man did not
appear again and the horses did not return
 
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own
small voice echoing in black tunnels calling frodo frodo but instead
of frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side where was merry
he woke cold air blew on his face he was lying on his back evening was
coming and the sky above was growing dim he turned and found that the dream was
little worse than the waking his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords
beside him merry lay white-faced with a dirty rag bound across his brows all
about them sat or stood a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became
separated from dream-shadows of course: he and merry had run off into the
woods what had come over them why had they dashed off like that taking no
notice of old strider they had run a long way shouting--he could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of
orcs: they were standing listening and they did not appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almost in their arms then they yelled and dozens of
other goblins had sprung out of the trees merry and he had drawn their swords
but the orcs did not wish to fight and had tried only to lay hold of them even
when merry had cut off several of their arms and hands good old merry
then boromir had come leaping through the trees he had made them fight he
slew many of them and the rest fled but they had not gone far on the way back
when they were attacked again by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrows: always at boromir boromir had blown his
great horn till the woods rang and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had
drawn back but when no answer but the echoes came they had attacked more
fierce than ever pippin did not remember much more his last memo was of
boromir leaning against a tree plucking out an arrow then darkness fell
suddenly
i suppose i was knocked on the head he said to himself i wonder if poor
merry is much hurt what has happened to boromir why didnt the orcs kill us
where are we and where are we going
he could not answer the questions he felt cold and sick i wish gandalf had
never persuaded elrond to let us come he thought what good have i been just
a nuisance: a passenger a piece of luggage and now i have been stolen and i am
just a piece of luggage for the orcs i hope strider or someone will come and
claim us but ought i to hope for it wont that throw out all the plans i wish
i could get free
he struggled a little quite uselessly one of the orcs sitting near laughed
and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue rest while you
can little fool he said then to pippin in the common speech which he made
almost as hideous as his own language rest while you can well find a use for
your legs before long youll wish you had got none before we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were dead now said the other id make
you squeak you miserable rat he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs
close to his face he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hissed dont draw attention to
yourself or i may forget my orders curse the isengarders uglúk
u bagronk sha pushdug saruman-glob búbhosh skai: he passed
into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering
and snarling
terrified pippin lay still though the pain at his wrists and ankles was
growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back to take his mind
off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear there were many
voices round about and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and
anger it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting
hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of
the orcs were using ordinary language apparently the members of two or three
quite different tribes were present and they could not understand one anothers
orc-speech there was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: which
way they were to take and what should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill them properly said one no time for play on this
trip
that cant be helped said another but why not kill them quick kill them
now theyre a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry evenings coming on and
we ought to get a move on
orders said a third voice in a deep growl kill all but not the
halfings they are to be brought back alive as quickly as possible
thats my orders
what are they wanted for asked several voices why alive do they give
good sport
no i heard that one of them has got something something thats wanted for
the war some elvish plot or other anyway theyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search them and find out we might find
something that we could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remark sneered a voice softer than the others
but more evil i may have to report that the prisoners are not to be searched
or plundered: those are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice alive and as captured no spoiling thats
my orders
not our orders said one of the earlier voices we have come all the way
from the mines to kill and avenge our folk i wish to kill and then go back
north
then you can wish again said the growling voice i am uglúk i
command i return to isengard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the great eye said the evil voice
we should go back at once to lugbúrz
if we could cross the great river we might said another voice but there
are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice a winged nazgûl awaits us
northward on the east-bank
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners and get all the pay
and praise in lugbúrz and leave us to foot it as best we can through the
horse-country no we must stick together these lands are dangerous: full of
foul rebels and brigands
aye we must stick together growled uglúk i dont trust you
little swine youve no guts outside your own sties but for us youd all have
run away we are the fighting uruk-hai we slew the great warrior we took the
prisoners we are the servants of saruman the wise the white hand: the hand
that gives us mans-flesh to eat we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose i am uglúk i have spoken
you have spoken more than enough uglúk sneered the evil voice i
wonder how they would like it in lugbúrz they might think that uglúks
shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head they might ask where his strange
ideas came from did they come from saruman perhaps who does he
think he is setting up on his own with his filthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnákh their trusted
messenger and i grishnákh say this: saruman is a fool and a dirty
treacherous fool but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being called swine by the
muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard its orc-flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc-speech answered him and the ringing clash of weapons
being drawn cautiously pippin rolled over hoping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to join in the fray in the twilight he saw a large black
orc probably uglúk standing facing grishnákh a short
crook-legged creature very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the
ground round them were many smaller goblins pippin supposed that these were
the ones from the north they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated
to attack uglúk
uglúk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly his own size ran
up then suddenly without warning uglúk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents grishnákh stepped
aside and vanished into the shadows the others gave way and one stepped
backwards and fell over merrys prostrate form with a curse yet that probably
saved his life for uglúks followers leaped over him and cut down
another with their broad-bladed swords it was the yellow-fanged guard his body
fell right on top of pippin still clutching its long saw-edged knife
put up your weapons shouted uglúk and lets have no more
nonsense we go straight west from here and down the stair from there straight
to the downs then along the river to the forest and we march day and night
that clear
now thought pippin if only it takes that ugly fellow a little while to
get his troop under control ive got a chance a gleam of hope had come to
him the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm and then slid down to his
wrist he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but he also felt the cold
touch of steel against his skin
the orcs were getting ready to march again but some of the northerners were
still unwilling and the isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing and confusion for the moment pippin was unwatched his
legs were securely bound but his arms were only tied about the wrists and his
hands were in front of him he could move them both together though the bonds
were cruelly tight he pushed the dead orc to one side then hardly daring to
breathe he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and down against the blade of the
knife it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast the cord was cut quickly
pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two
loops and slipped it over his hands then he lay very still
pick up those prisoners shouted uglúk dont play any tricks with
them if they are not alive when we get back someone else will die too
an orc seized pippin like a sack put its head between his tied hands
grabbed his arms and dragged them down until pippins face was crushed against
its neck then it jolted off with him another treated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again it was early night but
the slim moon was already falling westward they were on the edge of a cliff
that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist there was a sound of water
falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discover growled the voice of uglúk
only a single horseman and he made off westwards alls clear now
now i daresay but how long you fools you should have shot him hell
raise the alarm the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning now well
have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pippin it was uglúk sit up said the orc my
lads are tired of lugging you about we have got to climb down and you
must use your legs be helpful now no crying out no trying to escape we have
ways of paying for tricks that you wont like though they wont spoil your
usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles picked him up
by his hair and stood him on his feet pippin fell down and uglúk
dragged him up by his hair again several orcs laughed uglúk thrust a
flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt
a hot fierce glow flow through him the pain in his legs and ankles
vanished he could stand
now for the other said uglúk pippin saw him go to merry who was
lying close by and kick him merry groaned seizing him roughly uglúk
pulled him into a sitting position and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box merry
cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted cant take his medicine they jeered doesnt
know whats good for him ai we shall have some fun later
but at the moment uglúk was not engaged in sport he needed speed and
had to humour unwilling followers he was healing merry in orc-fashion and his
treatment worked swiftly when he had forced a drink from his flask down the
hobbits throat cut his leg-bonds and dragged him to his feet merry
stood up looking pale but grim and defiant and very much alive the gash in
his forehead gave him no more trouble but he bore a brown scar to the end of
his days
hullo pippin he said so youve come on this little expedition too
where do we get bed and breakfast
now then said uglúk none of that hold your tongues no talk to
one another any trouble will be reported at the other end and hell know how
to pay you youll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can
stomach
the orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty
plain below merry and pippin separated by a dozen orcs or more climbed down
with them at the bottom they stepped on to grass and the hearts of the hobbits
rose
now straight on shouted uglúk west and a little north follow
lugdush
but what are we going to do at sunrise said some of the northerners
go on running said uglúk what do you think sit on the grass and
wait for the whiteskins to join the picnic
but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you said uglúk run or youll never see
your beloved holes again by the white hand whats the use of sending out
mountain-maggots on a trip only half trained run curse you run while
night lasts
then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very
great each hobbit had a guard of three pippin was far back in the line he
wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food
since the morning one of his guards had a whip but at present the orc-liquor
was still hot in him his wits too were wide-awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen
face of strider bending over a dark trail and running running behind but what
could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc-feet his own little
prints and merrys were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes
before them and behind them and about them
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into
a wide shallow depression where the ground was soft and wet mist lay there
pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon the dark shapes of the orcs
in front grew dim and then were swallowed up
ai steady now shouted uglúk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at once he
swerved aside to the right and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard
headfirst into the mist he landed sprawling on the grass
halt yelled uglúk
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion pippin sprang up and ran but
the orcs were after him some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin but there is a hope that i have left
some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground he groped with his two tied
hands at his throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak just as long arms
and hard claws seized him he let it fall there i suppose it will lie until
the end of time he thought i dont know why i did it if the others have
escaped theyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip-thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted uglúk running up hes
still got to run a long way yet make em both run just use the whip as a
reminder
but thats not all he snarled turning to pippin i shant forget
payment is only put off leg it
neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the later part of the journey
evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery with hope
growing ever fainter behind they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly
handled if they halted or stumbled they were seized and dragged for some
distance
the warmth of the orc-draught had gone pippin felt cold and sick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the turf hard hands with rending nails
gripped and lifted him he was carried like a sack once more and darkness grew
about him: whether the darkness of another night or a blindness of his eyes he
could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the orcs
were demanding a halt uglúk was shouting he felt himself flung to the
ground and he lay as he fell till black dreams took him but he did not long
escape from pain soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again for a
long time he was tossed and shaken and then slowly the darkness gave
way and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning orders
were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair his head swam but from the
heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught an orc
stooped over him and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh he
ate the stale grey bread hungrily but not the meat he was famished but not yet
so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh of he dared not
guess what creature
he sat up and looked about merry was not far away they were by the banks of
a swift narrow river ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was catching the first
rays of the sun a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs a quarrel seemed on the
point of breaking out again between the northerners and the isengarders some
were pointing back away south and some were pointing eastward
very well said uglúk leave them to me then no killing as ive
told you before but if you want to throw away what weve come all the way to
get throw it away ill look after it let the fighting uruk-hai do the work
as usual if youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing ahead get to it its your best hope off you
go and quick before i knock a few more heads off to put some sense into the
others
there was some cursing and scuffling and then most of the northerners broke
away and dashed off over a hundred of them running wildly along the river
towards the mountains the hobbits were left with the isengarders: a grim dark
band four score at least of large swart slant-eyed orcs with great bows and
short broad-bladed swords a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained
with them
now well deal with grishnákh said uglúk but some even of
his own followers were looking uneasily southwards
i know growled uglúk the cursed horse-boys have got wind
of us but thats all your fault snaga you and the other scouts ought to have
your ears cut off but we are the fighters well feast on horseflesh yet or
something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the troop
had been pointing eastward from that direction there now came hoarse cries and
there was grishnákh again and at his back a couple of score of others
like him: long-armed crook-legged orcs they had a red eye painted on their
shields uglúk stepped forward to meet them so youve come
back he said thought better of it eh
ive returned to see that orders are carried out and the prisoners safe
answered grishnákh
indeed said uglúk waste of effort ill see that orders are
carried out in my command and what else did you come back for you went
in a hurry did you leave anything behind
i left a fool snarled grishnákh but there were some stout fellows
with him that are too good to lose i knew youd lead them into a mess ive
come to help them
splendid laughed uglúk but unless youve got some guts for
fighting youve taken the wrong way lugbúrz was your road the
whiteskins are coming whats happened to your precious nazgûl has he had
another mount shot under him now if youd brought him along that might have
been useful-if these nazgûl are all they make out
nazgûl nazgûl
said grishnákh shivering and licking his lips as if the word had a foul
taste that he savoured painfully you speak of what is deep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams uglúk he said nazgûl ah all that
they make out one day youll wish that you had not said that ape he snarled
fiercely you ought to know that theyre the apple of the great eye but the
winged nazgûl: not yet not yet he wont let them show themselves
across the great river yet not too soon theyre for the war-and other
purposes
you seem to know a lot said uglúk more than is good for you i
guess perhaps those in lugbúrz might wonder how and why but in the
meantime the uruk-hai of isengard can do the dirty work as usual dont stand
slavering there get your rabble together the other swine are legging it to the
forest youd better follow you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs
then the troop started off hour after hour they ran pausing now and again only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers either because they were quicker
and hardier or because of some plan of grishnákhs the isengarders
gradually passed through the orcs of mordor and grishnákhs folk closed
in behind soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead the forest
began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated by the filthy jowl
and hairy ear of the orc that held him immediately in front were bowed backs
and tough thick legs going up and down up and down unresting as if they were
made of wire and horn beating out the nightmare seconds of an endless time
in the afternoon uglúks troop overtook the northerners they were
flagging in the rays of the bright sun winter sun shining in a pale cool sky
though it was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
maggots jeered the isengarders youre cooked the whiteskins will catch
you and eat you theyre coming
a cry from grishnákh showed that this was not mere jest horsemen
riding very swiftly had indeed been sighted: still far behind but gaining on
the orcs gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in a
quicksand
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished pippin a
terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race then he saw that the sun was
sinking falling behind the misty mountains shadows reached over the land the
soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed the forest
was dark and close already they had passed a few outlying trees the land was
beginning to slope upwards ever more steeply but
the orcs did not halt both uglúk and grishnákh shouted spurring
them on to a last effort
they will make it yet they will escape thought pippin and then he
managed to twist his neck so as to glance back with one eye over his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were already level with the orcs galloping
over the plain the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their
pale flowing hair they were hemming the orcs in preventing them from
scattering and driving them along the line of the river
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were he wished now that he had
learned more in rivendell and looked more at maps and things but in those days
the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands and he had never
reckoned with being cut off from gandalf or from strider and even from frodo
all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs horse shadowfax had
come from that land that sounded hopeful as far as it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought i dont suppose
theyve ever heard of hobbits down here i suppose i ought to be glad that the
beastly orcs look like being destroyed but i would rather be saved myself the
chances were that he and merry would be killed together with their captors
before ever the men of rohan were aware of them
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen skilled at shooting from a running
horse riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs that straggled
behind and several of them fell then the riders wheeled away out of the range
of the answering bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumbled and did not get up again
night came down without the riders closing in for battle many orcs had
fallen but fully two hundred remained in the early darkness the orcs came to a
hillock the eaves of the forest were very near probably
no more than three furlongs away but they could go no further the horsemen had
encircled them a small band disobeyed uglúks command and ran on
towards the forest: only three returned
well here we are sneered grishnákh fine leadership i hope the
great uglúk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered uglúk taking no notice of grishnákh
you lugdush get two others and stand guard over them theyre not to be
killed unless the filthy whiteskins break through understand as long
as im alive i want em but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be
rescued bind their legs
the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly but pippin found that
for the first time he was close to merry the orcs were making a great deal of
noise shouting and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper
together for a while
i dont think much of this said merry i feel nearly done in dont think
i could crawl away far even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin lembas: ive got some have you i
dont think theyve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered merry but it must be battered
to crumbs anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket
you wont have to ive- but just then a savage kick warned pippin that
the noise had died down and the guards were watchful
the night was cold and still all round the knoll on which the orcs were
gathered little watch-fires sprang up golden-red in the darkness a complete
ring of them they were within a long bowshot but
the riders did not show themselves against the light and the orcs wasted many
arrows shooting at the fires until uglúk stopped them the riders made
no sound later in the night when the moon came out of the mist then
occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in
the white light as they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the guards why dont
we get together and charge through whats old uglúk
think hes doing i should like to know
i daresay you would snarled uglúk stepping up from behind meaning
i dont think at all eh curse you youre as bad as the other rabble: the
maggots and the apes of lugbúrz no good trying to charge with
them theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more than enough of these
filthy horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets in
the dark but these whiteskins have better night-eyes
than most men from all ive heard and dont forget their horses they can see
the night-breeze or so its said still theres one thing the fine fellows
dont know: mauhúr and his lads are in the forest and they should turn
up any time now
uglúks words were enough apparently to
satisfy the isengarders but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay on the ground resting in the
pleasant darkness it did indeed become very dark again for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pippin could not see anything a few feet
away the fires brought no light to the hillock the riders were not however
content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest a sudden outcry
on the east side of the knoll showed that something
was wrong it seemed that some of the men had ridden in close slipped off their
horses crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several orcs and then had
faded away again uglúk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up their guards isengarders had gone with uglúk
but if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed a long hairy
arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together dimly they were
aware of grishnákhs great head and hideous face between them his
foul breath was on their cheeks he began to paw them and feel them pippin
shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my little ones said grishnákh in a soft whisper enjoying
your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed perhaps: swords and
whips on one side and nasty spears on the other little people should not
meddle _in affairs that are too big for them his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught direct from the
urgent thought of his enemy: grishnákh knows about the ring hes
looking for it while uglúk is busy: he probably wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippins heart yet at the same time he was wondering what use
he could make of grishnákhs desire
i dont think you will find it that way he whispered it isnt easy to
find
find it said grishnákh: his
fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoulder find what what
are you talking about little one for a moment pippin was silent then
suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: gollum gollum
nothing my precious he added
the hobbits felt grishnákhs fingers twitch o ho hissed the
goblin softly thats what he means is it o ho very ve-ry dangerous my
little ones
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess perhaps and
not only for us still you know your own business best do you want it or not
and what would you give for it
do i want it do i want it said grishnákh as if puzzled but his
arms were trembling what would i give for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing his words carefully that its no good
groping in the dark we could save you time and trouble but you must untie our
legs first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear tender little fools hissed grishnákh everything you have
and everything you know will be got out of you in due time: everything
youll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed
you will: quite soon we shant hurry the enquiry oh dear no what do you think
youve been kept alive for my dear little fellows please believe me when i say
that it was not out of kindness: thats not even
one of uglúks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry but you havent got your prey
home yet and it doesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens if we come
to isengard it wont be the great grishnákh
that benefits: saruman will take all that he can find if you want anything for
yourself nows the time to do a deal
grishnákh began to lose his temper the name of saruman seemed
specially to enrage him time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
uglúk or the isengarders might return at any minute
have you got it - either of you he snarled
gollum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling violently curse you you filthy little
vermin he hissed untie your legs ill untie every string in your bodies do
you think i cant search you to the bones search you ill cut you both to
quivering shreds i dont need the help of your legs to get you away-and have
you all to myself
suddenly he seized them the strength in his long arms and shoulders was
terrifying he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them fiercely to
his sides a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their mouths then he
sprang forward stooping low quickly and silently he went until he came to the
edge of the knoll there choosing a gap between the watchers he passed like an
evil shadow out into the night down the slope and away westward towards the
river that flowed out of the forest in that direction there was a wide open
space with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted peering and listening nothing could be
seen or heard he crept slowly on bent almost double then he squatted and
listened again then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash at that very
moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of him a horse snorted
and reared a man called out
grishnákh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits under
him then he drew his sword no doubt he meant to kill his captives
rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing the
sword rang faintly and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to his
left an arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill
or guided by fate and it pierced his right hand he dropped the sword and
shrieked there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as grishnákh leaped
up and ran he was ridden down and a spear passed through him he gave a hideous
shivering cry and lay still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnákh had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrades aid whether because of
some special keenness of sight or because of some other sense the horse lifted
and sprang lightly over them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elven-cloaks too crushed for the moment and too afraid to
move
at last merry stirred and whispered softly: so far so good: but how are we
to avoid being spitted
the answer came almost immediately the cries of
grishnákh had roused the orcs from the yells and screeches that came
from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered:
uglúk was probably knocking off a few more heads then suddenly the
answering cries of orc-voices came from the right outside the circle of
watch-fires from the direction of the forest and the mountains mauhúr
had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers there was the sound of
galloping horses the riders were drawing in their ring close round the
knoll risking the orc-arrows so as to prevent any sortie while a company rode
off to deal with the newcomers suddenly merry and pippin realized that without
moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and
escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and hands free we might get
away but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin i was going to tell you: ive managed to free
my hands these loops are only left for show youd better have a bit of lembas
first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet the cakes were
broken but good still in their leaf-wrappings the hobbits each ate two or
three pieces the taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces and
laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away for a while they ate
thoughtfully sitting in the dark heedless of the cries and sounds of battle
nearby pippin was the first to come back to the present
we must be off he said half a moment
grishnákhs sword was lying close at hand but it was too heavy and
clumsy for him to use so he crawled forward and finding the body of the goblin
he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife with this he quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be able
to stand again and walk but in any case we had better start by crawling
they crawled the turf was deep and yielding and that helped them: but it
seemed a long slow business they gave the watch-fire a wide berth and wormed
their way forward bit by bit until they came to the edge of the river gurgling
away in the black shadows under its deep banks then they looked back
the sounds had died away evidently mauhúr and his lads had
been killed or driven off the riders had returned to their silent ominous
vigil it would not last very much longer already the night was old in the
east which had remained unclouded the sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen it will not be
any comfort to us if these riders discover that we are not orcs after we are
dead he got up and stamped his feet those cords have cut me like wires but
my feet are getting warm again i could stagger on now what about you merry
merry got up yes he said i can manage it lembas does put heart
into you a more wholesome sort of feeling too than the heat of that
orc-draught i wonder what it was made of better not to know i expect lets
get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it
not here the banks are too steep said pippin forward now
they turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river
behind them the light grew in the east as they walked they compared notes
talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their
capture no listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered
cruelly and been in dire peril going without hope towards torment and death
or that even now as they knew well they had little chance of ever finding
friend or safety again
you seem to have been doing well master took said merry you will get
almost a chapter in old bilbos book if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work: especially guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up
to him but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and find that
brooch i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i am to get level with you indeed
cousin brandybuck is going in front now this is where he comes in i dont
suppose you have much notion where we are but i spent my time at rivendell
rather better we are walking west along the entwash the butt-end of the misty
mountains is in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees creeping away from the
coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin or lead back we have been warned
against fangorn but one so knowing will not have forgotten that
i have not answered merry but the forest seems better to me all the
same than turning back into the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees old beyond guessing
they seemed great trailing beards of lichen hung from them blowing and swaying
in the breeze out of the shadows the hobbits peeped gazing back down the
slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf-children in
the deeps of time peering out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn
far over the great river and the brown lands leagues upon grey leagues
away the dawn came red as flame loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it the
riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life horn answered horn again
merry and pippin heard clear in the cold air the neighing of war-horses
and the sudden singing of many men the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire
above the margin of the world then with a great cry the riders charged from the
east the red light gleamed on mail and spear the orcs yelled and shot all the
arrows that remained to them the hobbits saw several horsemen fall but their
line held on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again most
of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled this way and that
pursued one by one to the death but one band holding together in a black
wedge drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest straight up the
slope they charged towards the watchers now they were drawing near and it
seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down three riders
that barred their way
we have watched too long said merry theres
uglúk i dont want to meet him again the hobbits turned and fled deep
into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not sec the last stand when uglúk was
overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of fangorn there he was slain at
last by éomer the third marshal of the mark who dismounted and fought
him sword to sword and over the wide fields the keen-eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their
praises the riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came ever back either to mordor or to
isengard but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many
watchful eyes
 
chapter 4
treebeard
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest
allowed following the line of the running stream westward and up towards the
slopes of the mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn slowly their fear of
the orcs died away and their pace slackened a queer stifling feeling came over
them as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing
at last merry halted we cant go on like this he panted i want some
air
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin im parched he clambered on
to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cupped hands it was clear and cold and he took many draughts
merry followed him the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts
for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream dabbling their sore
feet and legs and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them
rank upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning back against a
great tree-trunk we can at least follow the course of this stream the entwash
or whatever you call it and get out again the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said merry and if we could breathe
properly
yes it is all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin it reminds me
somehow of the old room in the great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough: a huge place where the furniture has never been moved or
changed for generations they say the old took lived in it year after year
while he and the room got older and shabbier together-and it has never changed
since he died a century ago and old gerontius was my great-great-grandfather:
that puts it back a bit but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of lichen and most of
the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen
untidy i cant imagine what spring would look like here if it ever comes
still less a spring-cleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes said merry it does not
look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood that was all dark and
black and the home of dark black things this is just dim and frightfully
tree-ish you cant imagine animals living here at all or staying for
long
no nor hobbits said pippin and i dont like the thought of trying to
get through it either nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess how
are our supplies
low said merry we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of lembas
and left everything else behind they looked at what remained of the
elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days that was all and not
a wrap or a blanket said merry we shall be cold tonight whichever way we
go
well wed better decide on the way now said pippin the morning must be
getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared some way
further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the
forest-roof
hullo said merry the sun must have run into a cloud while weve been
under these trees and now she has run out again or else she has climbed high
enough to look down through some opening it isnt far - lets go and
investigate
they found it was further than they thought the ground was rising steeply
still and it was becoming increasingly stony the light grew broader as they
went on and soon they saw that there was a rock-wall before them: the side of a
hill or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on it and the sun was falling full on its stony face the twigs
of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff and still as if reaching out
to the warmth where all had looked so shabby and grey before the wood now
gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth black-greys of bark like polished
leather the boles of the trees glowed with a soft green like young grass: early
spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them
in the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural
perhaps and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock for it was rough
and uneven high up almost level with the tops of forest-trees there was a
shelf under a cliff nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge
and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it looked almost
like the figure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the
morning-light
up we go said merry joyfully now for a breath of air and a sight of the
land
they climbed and scrambled up the rock if the stair had been made it was for
bigger feet and longer legs than theirs they were too eager to be surprised at
the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and
their vigour had returned they came at length to the edge of the shelf almost
at the feet of the old stump then they sprang up and turned round with their
backs to the hill breathing deep and looking out eastward they saw that they
had only come some three or four miles into the forest: the heads of the trees
marched down the slopes towards the plain there near the fringe of the forest
tall spires of curling black smoke went up wavering and floating towards them
the winds changing said merry its turned east again it feels cool up
here
yes said pippin im afraid this is only a passing gleam and it will all
go grey again what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in the
sunlight i almost felt i liked the place
almost felt you liked the forest thats good thats uncommonly kind of
you said a strange voice turn round and let me have a look at your faces i
almost feel that i dislike you both but do not let us be hasty turn round a
large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders and they were
twisted round gently but irresistibly then two great arms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face it belonged
to a large man-like almost troll-like figure at least fourteen foot high
very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck whether it was clad in stuff
like green and grey bark or whether that was its hide was difficult to say at
any rate the arms at a short distance from the trunk were not wrinkled but
covered with a brown smooth skin the large feet had seven toes each the lower
part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard bushy almost
twiggy at the roots thin and mossy at the ends but at the moment the hobbits
noted little but the eyes these deep eyes were now surveying them slow and
solemn but very penetrating they were brown shot with a green light often
afterwards pippin tried to describe his first impression of them
one felt as if there was an enormous well behind them filled up with ages
of memory and long slow steady thinking but their surface was sparkling with
the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree or on the
ripples of a very deep lake i dont know but it felt as if something that grew
in the ground-asleep you might say or just feeling itself as something between
roof-tip and leaf-tip between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and was
considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside
affairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured the voice a deep voice like a very deep
woodwind instrument very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto but if
i had seen you before i heard your voices - i liked them: nice little voices
they reminded me of something i cannot remember - if i had seen you before i
heard you i should have just trodden on you taking you for little orcs and
found out my mistake afterwards very odd you are indeed root and twig very
odd
pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid under those eyes he felt
a curious suspense but not fear please he said who are you and what are
you
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind of wariness the deep wells were
covered over hrum now answered the voice well i am an ent or
thats what they call me yes ent is the word the ent i am you might
say in your manner of speaking fangorn is my name according to some treebeard
others make it treebeard will do
an ent said merry whats that but what do you call yourself
whats your real name
hoo now replied treebeard hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i am doing the asking you are in my country what are you
i wonder i cannot place you you do not seem to come in the old lists that i
learned when i was young but that was a long long time ago and they may have
made new lists let me see let me see how did it go
learn now the lore of living creatures

first name the four the free peoples:

eldest of all the elf-children

dwarf the delver dark are his houses

ent the earthborn old as mountains

man the mortal master of horses:
hm hm hm
beaver the builder buck the leaper

bear bee-hunter boar the fighter

hound is hungry hare is fearful…
hm hm
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture

hart horn-crowned hawk is swiftest

swan the whitest serpent coldest…
hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum room tum roomty toom tum it
was a long list but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem to have got left out of the old lists and the old stories
said merry yet weve been about for quite a long time were hobbits
why not make a new line said pippin
half-grown hobbits the hole-dwellers
put us in amongst the four next to man the big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard that would do so you live in holes
eh it sounds very right and proper who calls you hobbits though that
does not sound elvish to me elves made all the old words: they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves hobbits but
you should not go telling just anybody youll be letting out your own right
names if youre not careful
we arent careful about that said merry as a matter of fact im a
brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck though most people call me just merry
and im a took peregrin took but im generally called pippin or even
pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard i am honoured by
your confidence but you should not be too free all at once there are ents and
ents you know or there are ents and things that look like ents but aint as
you might say ill call you merry and pippin if you please - nice names for i
am not going to tell you my name not yet at any rate a queer half-knowing
half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes for one thing it
would take a long while: my name is growing all the time and ive lived a very
long long time so my name is like a story real names tell you the
story of the things they belong to in my language in the old entish as you
might say it is a lovely language but it takes a very long time to say
anything in it because we do not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to listen to
but now and the eyes became very bright and present seeming to grow
smaller and almost sharp what is going on what are you doing in it all i can
see and hear and smell and feel a great deal from this from
this from this
a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burúmë excuse me:
that is a part of my name for it i do not know what the word is in the outside
languages: you know the thing we are on where i stand and look out on fine
mornings and think about the sun and the grass beyond the wood and the
horses and the clouds and the unfolding of the world what is going on what
is gandalf up to and these - burárum
he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a great organ - these orcs and
young saruman down at isengard i like news but not too quick now
there is quite a lot going on said merry: and even if we tried to be
quick it would take a long time to tell but you told us not to be hasty ought
we to tell you anything so soon would you think it rude if we asked what you
are going to do with us and which side you are on and did you know gandalf
yes i do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees  said
treebeard do you know him
yes said pippin sadly we did he was a great friend and he was our
guide
then i can answer your other questions said treebeard i am not going to
do anything with you: not if you mean by that do something to
you without your leave we might do some things together i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your way may go along with mine for a while but you speak
of master gandalf as if he was in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly the story seems to be going on but i am
afraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard hoom hm ah well he paused looking long
at the hobbits: hoom ah well i do not know what to say come now
if you would like to hear more said merry we will tell you but it will
take some time wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit here together
in the sun while it lasts you must be getting tired of holding us up
hm tired no i am not tired i do not easily get tired and i do
not sit down i am not very hm bendable but there the sun is going
in let us leave this - did you say what you call it
hill suggested pippin shelf step suggested merry
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully hill yes that was it
but it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of
the world was shaped never mind let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far
i do not know you might call it far perhaps but what does that matter
well you see we have lost all our belongings said merry we have only a
little food
o hm you need not trouble about that said treebeard i can give you a
drink that will keep you green and growing for a long long while and if we
decide to part company i can set you down outside my country at any point you
choose let us go
holding the hobbits gently but firmly one in the crook of each arm
treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other and moved them to
the edge of the shelf the rootlike toes grasped the rocks then carefully and
solemnly he stalked down from step to step and reached the floor of the
forest
at once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees deeper and
deeper into the wood never far from the stream climbing steadily up towards
the slopes of the mountains many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merely passed by but some quivered and some
raised up their branches above his head as he approached all the while as he
walked he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time they felt oddly enough safe and
comfortable and they had a great deal to think and wonder about at last pippin
ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask you something why did celeborn
warn us against your forest he told us not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard and i might have said much the same
if you had been going the other way do not risk getting entangled in the woods
of laurelindórenan
that is what the elves used to call it but now they make the name shorter:
lothlórien they call it perhaps they are right: maybe it is fading not
growing land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time now
it is the dreamflower ah well but it is a queer place and not for just
any one to venture in i am surprised that you ever got out but much more
surprised that you ever got in: that has not happened to strangers for many a
year it is a queer land
and so is this folk have come to grief here aye they have to grief
laurelindórenan lindelorendor malinornélion ornemalin
he hummed to himself they are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything else outside the golden
wood is what it was when celeborn was young still:
taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna tumbaletaurëa lómëanor
that is what they used to say things have changed but it is still true in
places
what do you mean said pippin what is true
the trees and the ents said treebeard i do not understand all that goes
on myself so i cannot explain it to you some of us are still true ents and
lively enough in our fashion but many are growing sleepy going tree-ish as
you might say most of the trees are just trees of course but many are half
awake some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts nothing to
do with their wood: i do not mean that why i knew some good old willows down
the entwash gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they were
falling all to pieces but as quiet and sweet-spoken as a young leaf and then
there are some trees in the valleys under the mountains sound as a bell and
bad right through that sort of thing seems to spread there used to be some
very dangerous parts in this country there are still some very black patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse i do not doubt there is some
shadow of the great darkness lying there still away north and bad memories are
handed down but there are hollow dales in this land where the darkness has
never been lifted and the trees are older than i am still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train and we teach we walk and
we weed
we are tree-herds we old ents few enough of us are left now sheep get
like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is said but slowly and neither
have long in the world it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and they
walk down the ages together for ents are more like elves: less interested in
themselves than men are and better at getting inside other things and yet
again ents are more like men more changeable than elves are and quicker at
taking the colour of the outside you might say or better than both: for they
are steadier and keep their minds on things longer some of my kin look just
like trees now and need something great to rouse them and they speak only in
whispers but some of my trees are limb-lithe and many can talk to me elves
began it of course waking trees up and teaching them to speak and learning
their tree-talk they always wished to talk to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away over the sea or fled
into far valleys and hid themselves and made songs about days that would never
come again never again aye aye there was all one wood once upon a time: from
here to the mountains of lune and this was just the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could walk and sing all day and
hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills the woods were
like the woods of lothlórien only thicker
stronger younger and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just
breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making hardly a sound with his
great feet then he began to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them:
in the willow-meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring

ah the sight and the smell of the spring in nan-tasarion

and i said that was good

i wandered in summer in the elm-woods of ossiriand

ah the light and the music in the summer by the seven rivers of ossir

and i thought that was best

to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn

ah the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the autumn in
taur-na-neldor

it was more than my desire

to the pine-trees upon the highland of dorthonion i climbed in the winter

ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of winter upon
orod-na-thôn

my voice went up and sang in the sky

and now all those lands lie under the wave

and i walk in ambaróna in tauremorna in aldalómë

in my own land in the country of fangorn

where the roots are long

and the years lie thicker than the leaves

in tauremornalómë
he ended and strode on silently and in all the wood as far as ear could
reach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees at last the
hobbits saw rising dimly before them a steep dark land: they had come to the
feet of the mountains and to the green roots of tall methedras down the
hillside the young entwash leaping from its springs high above ran noisily
from step to step to meet them on the right of the stream there was a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight no trees grew there and it was
open to the sky stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace suddenly before
them the hobbits saw a wide opening two great trees stood there one on either
side like living gate-posts but there was no gate save their crossing and
interwoven boughs as the old ent approached the trees lifted up their
branches and all their leaves quivered and rustled for they were evergreen
trees and their leaves were dark and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space as though the floor of a great hall had been
cut in the side of the hill on either hand the walls sloped upwards until they
were fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that
also increased in height as they marched inwards
at the far end the rock-wall was sheer but at the bottom it had been
hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the hall
save the branches of the trees which at the inner end overshadowed all the
ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle a little stream escaped
from the springs above and leaving the main water fell tinkling down the sheer
face of the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain in front of the
arched bay the water was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between
the trees and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path out to
rejoin the entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treebeard breaking his long silence i have brought
you about seventy thousand ent-strides but what that comes to in the
measurement of your land i do not know anyhow we are near the roots of the last
mountain part of the name of this place might be wellinghall if it were turned
into your language i like it we will stay here tonight he set them down on
the grass between the aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the
great arch the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent but
his legs opened in a great stride he planted his big toes and they were indeed
big and very broad on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring and took a
deep breath then he laughed and passed inside a great stone table stood
there but no chairs at the back of the bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table they seemed to
be filled with water but he held his hands over them and immediately they
began to glow one with a golden and the other with a rich green light and the
blending of the two lights lit the bay as if the sun of summer was shining
through a roof of young leaves looking back the hobbits saw that the trees in
the court had also begun to glow faintly at first but steadily quickening
until every leaf was edged with light: some green some gold some red as
copper while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard you are thirsty i
expect perhaps you are also tired drink this he went to the back of the bay
and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there with heavy lids he
removed one of the lids and dipped in a great ladle and with it filled three
bowls one very large bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent-house he said and there are no seats i fear but you may
sit on the table picking up the hobbits he set them on the great stone slab
six feet above the ground and there they sat dangling their legs and drinking
in sips
the drink was like water indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had
drunk from the entwash near the borders of the forest and yet there was some
scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was faint but it
reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at
night the effect of the draught began at the toes and rose steadily through
every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards right to the
tips of the hair indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads was
actually standing up waving and curling and growing as for treebeard he first
laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch and then he drained his bowl at one
draught one long slow draught the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl down again ah - ah he sighed hm hoom now we
can talk easier you can sit on the floor and i will lie down that will
prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep
on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs not more than
a couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken treebeard
lowered himself slowly on to this with only the slightest sign of bending at
his middle until he lay at full length with his arms behind his head looking
up at the ceiling upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in
the sunshine merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they
left hobbiton they followed no very clear order for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often stopped the speaker and went back to
some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about later events they
said nothing whatever about the ring and did not tell him why they set out or
where they were going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interested in everything: in
the black riders in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom bombadil
in the mines of moria and in lothlórien and galadriel he made them
describe the shire and its country over and over again he said an odd
thing at this point you never see any hm any ents round there do you he
asked well not ents entwives i should really say
entwives said pippin are they like you at all
yes hm well no: i do not really know now said treebeard thoughtfully
but they would like your country so i just wondered
treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all in sarumans doings the hobbits regretted
very much that they knew so little about them: only
a rather vague report by sam of what gandalf had told the council but they were
clear at any rate that uglúk and his troop came from isengard and spoke
of saruman as their master
hm hoom said treebeard when at last their story had wound and wandered
down to the battle of the orcs and the riders of rohan well well that is a
bundle of news and no mistake you have not told me all no indeed not by a
long way but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish there is
something very big going on that i can see and what it is maybe i shall learn
in good time or in bad time by root and twig but it is a strange business: up
sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists and behold the nine
forgotten riders reappear to hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great
journey and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs pursue them
down all the leagues of wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great
storm i hope they weather it
and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars said treebeard they
mostly concern elves and men that is the business of wizards: wizards are
always troubled about the future i do not like worrying about the future i am
not altogether on anybodys side because nobody is altogether on my side
if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as i care for them not even
elves nowadays still i take more kindly to elves than to others: it was the
elves that cured us of dumbness long ago and that was a great gift that cannot
be forgotten though our ways have parted since and there are some things of
course whose side i am altogether not on i
am against them altogether: these - burárum he again made a deep rumble
of disgust - these orcs and their masters
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on mirkwood but when it removed to
mordor i did not trouble for a while: mordor is a long way away but it seems
that the wind is setting east and the withering of all woods may be drawing
near there is naught that an old ent can do to hold back that storm: he must
weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighbour: i cannot overlook him i must do
something i suppose i have often wondered lately what i should do about
saruman
who is saruman asked pippin do you know anything about his history
saruman is a wizard answered treebeard more than that i cannot say i do
not know the history of wizards they appeared first after the great ships came
over the sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell saruman was
reckoned great among them i believe he gave up wandering about and minding the
affairs of men and elves some time ago - you would call it a very long time
ago: and he settled down at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow he was chosen to be
head of the white council they say but that did not turn out too well i
wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways but at any rate he
used to give no trouble to his neighbours i used to talk to him there was a
time when he was always walking about my woods he was polite in those days
always asking my leave at least when he met me and always eager to listen i
told him many things that he would never have found out by himself but he never
repaid me in like kind i cannot remember that he ever told me anything and he
got more and more like that his face as i remember it - i have not seen it for
many a day - became like windows in a stone wall: windows with shutters inside
i think that i now understand what he is up to he is plotting to become a
power he has a mind of metal and wheels and he does not care for growing
things except as far as they serve him for the moment and now it is clear that
he is a black traitor he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs brm hoom
worse than that: he has been doing something to them something dangerous for
these isengarders are more like wicked men it is a mark of evil things that
came in the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but sarumans orcs
can endure it even if they hate it i wonder what he has done are they men he
has ruined or has he blended the races of orcs and men that would be a black
evil
treebeard rumbled for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep
subterranean entish malediction some time ago i began to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on only lately did i guess that
saruman was to blame and that long ago he had been spying out all the ways and
discovering my secrets he and his foul folk are making havoc now down on the
borders they are felling trees-good trees some of the trees they just cut down
and leave to rot - orc-mischief that but most are hewn up and carried off to
feed the fires of orthanc there is always a smoke rising from isengard these
days
curse him root and branch many of those trees were my friends creatures i
had known from nut and acorn many had voices of their own that are lost for
ever now and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were
singing groves i have been idle i have let things slip it must stop
treebeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk stood up and thumped his
hand on the table the vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes and his beard stood out stiff
as a great besom
i will stop it he boomed and you shall come with me you may be able to
help me you will be helping your own friends that way too for if saruman is
not checked rohan and gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front our
roads go together - to isengard
we will come with you said merry we will do what we can
yes said pippin i should like to see the white hand overthrown i should
like to be there even if i could not be of much use: i shall never forget uglúk
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard but i spoke hastily we must not be hasty i
have become too hot i must cool myself and think fur it is easier to shout stop
than to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain of
the spring then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops of water
fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again he seemed to be
counting on his fingers fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed the
trouble is that there are so few of us left he said turning towards the
hobbits only three remain of the first ents that walked in the woods before
the darkness: only myself fangorn and finglas and fladrif - to give them their
elvish names you may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for this business
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree-ish you might say: he has taken to
standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of
the meadows round his knees covered with leafy hair he is he used to rouse up
in winter but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then skinbark
lived on the mountain-slopes west of isengard that is where the worst trouble
has been he was wounded by the orcs and many of his folk and his tree-herds
have been murdered and destroyed he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down still i daresay i could
get together a fair company of our younger folks - if i could make them
understand the need: if i could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk what a pity
there are so few of us
why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long asked
pippin have a great many died
oh no said treebeard none have died from inside as you might say some
have fallen in the evil chances of the long years of course: and more have
grown tree-ish but there were never many of us and we have not increased there
have been no entings - no children you would say not for a terrible long count
of years you see we lost the entwives
how very sad said pippin how was it that they all died
they did not die said treebeard i never said died we lost
them i said we lost them and we cannot find them he sighed i thought most
folk knew that there were songs about the hunt of the ents for the entwives
sung among elves and men from mirkwood to gondor they cannot be quite
forgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come west over the mountains to the
shire said merry wont you tell us some more or sing us one of the songs
yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request but
i cannot tell it properly only in short and then we must end our talk:
tomorrow we have councils to call and work to do and maybe a journey to
begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he went on after a pause when the
world was young and the woods were wide and wild the ents and the entwives -
and there were entmaidens then: ah the loveliness of fimbrethil of wandlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our youth - they walked together and they
housed together but our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the ents
gave their love to things that they met in the world and the entwives gave
their thought to other things for the ents loved the great trees and the wild
woods and the slopes of the high hills and they drank of the mountain-streams
and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path and they learned of
the elves and spoke with the trees but the entwives gave their minds to the
lesser trees and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests
and they saw the sloe in the thicket and the wild apple and the cherry
blossoming in spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer and the
seeding grasses in the autumn fields they did not desire to speak with these
things but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them the
entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes and bear leaf and fruit
to their liking for the entwives desired order and plenty and peace by which
they meant that things should remain where they had set them so the entwives
made gardens to live in but we ents went on wandering and we only came to the
gardens now and again then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crossed the great river and made new gardens and tilled new fields and we saw
them more seldom after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwives
blossomed richly and their fields were full of corn many men learned the
crafts of the entwives and honoured them greatly but we were only a legend to
them a secret in the heart of the forest yet here we still are while all the
gardens of the entwives are wasted: men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago - in the time of the war between sauron and the
men of the sea - desire came over me to see fimbrethil again very fair she was
still in my eyes when i had last seen her though little like the entmaiden of
old for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour their hair parched
by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples yet their
eyes were still the eyes of our own people we crossed over anduin and came to
their land: but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted for war had
passed over it but the entwives were not there long we called and long we
searched and we asked all folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and some said that they had seen them
walking away west and some said east and others south but nowhere that we
went could we find them our sorrow was very great yet the wild wood called
and we returned to it for many years we used to go out every now and again and
look for the entwives walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful
names but as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far and now the
entwives are only a memory for us and our beards are long and grey the elves
made many songs concerning the search of the ents and some of the songs passed
into the tongues of men but we made no songs about it being content to chant
their beautiful names when we thought of the entwives we believe that we may
meet again in a time to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where
we can live together and both be content but it is foreboded that that will
only be when we have both lost all that we now have and it may well be that
that time is drawing near at last for if sauron of old destroyed the gardens
the enemy today seems likely to wither all the woods
there was an elvish song that spoke of this or at least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and down the great river it was never an entish song
mark you: it would have been a very long song in entish but we know it by
heart and hum it now and again this is how it runs in your tongue:
ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is in the bough when
light is on the wild-wood stream and wind is on the brow when stride is
long and breath is deep and keen the mountain-air come back to me come
back to me and say my land is fair
entwife
when spring is come to garth and field and corn is in the blade when
blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid when shower and sun
upon the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here and will not
come because my land is fair
ent
when summer lies upon the world and in a noon of gold beneath the roof
of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold when woodland halls are
green and cool and wind is in the west come back to me come back to me
and say my land is best
entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown when
straw is gold and ear is white and harvest comes to town when honey
spills and apple swells though wind be in the west ill linger here
beneath the sun because my land is best
ent
when winter comes the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay when
trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day when wind is
in the deadly east then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and call
to thee ill come to thee again
entwife
when winter comes and singing ends when darkness falls at last when
broken is the barren bough and light and labour past ill look for thee
and wait for thee until we meet again: together we will take the road
beneath the bitter rain
both
together we will take the road that leads into the west and far away
will find a land where both our hearts may rest
treebeard ended his song that is how it goes he said it is elvish of
course: lighthearted quickworded and soon over i daresay it is fair enough
but the ents could say more on their side if they had time but now i am going
to stand up and take a little sleep where will you stand
we usually lie down to sleep said merry we shall be all right where we
are
lie down to sleep said treebeard why of course you do hm hoom: i was
forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times almost thought that i
was talking to young entings i did well you can lie on the bed i am going to
stand in the rain good night
merry and pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and
fern it was fresh and sweet-scented and warm the lights died down and the
glow of the trees faded but outside under the arch they could see old treebeard
standing motionless with his arms raised above his head the bright stars
peered out of the sky and lit the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court and on to the
floor of the bay shreds of high cloud were overhead running on a stiff
easterly wind treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and pippin were
bathing in the basin by the arch they heard him humming and singing as he came
up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he saw them you
sleep long i have been many a hundred strides already today now we will have a
drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar but from a different jar
the taste was not the same as it had been the night before: it was earthier and
richer more sustaining and food-like so to speak while the hobbits drank
sitting on the edge of the bed and nibbling small pieces of elf-cake more
because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because
they felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or elvish or some strange
tongue and looking up at the sky
where is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round it is not a place it is
a gathering of ents - which does not often happen nowadays but i have managed
to make a fair number promise to come we shall meet in the place where we have
always met: derndingle men call it it is away south from here we must be there
before noon
before long they set off treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the
previous day at the entrance to the court he turned to the right stepped over
the stream and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes
where trees were scanty above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and
rowan and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods soon treebeard turned a little
away from the hills and plunged into deep groves where the trees were larger
taller and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before for a while
they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first
ventured into fangorn but it soon passed treebeard did not talk to them he
hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and pippin caught no proper
words: it sounded like boom boom rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom
boom dahrar boom and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm now
and again they thought they heard an answer a hum or a quiver of sound that
seemed to come out of the earth or from boughs above their heads or perhaps
from the boles of the trees but treebeard did not stop or turn his head to
either side
they had been going for a long while - pippin had tried to keep count of the
ent-strides but had failed getting lost at about three thousand - when
treebeard began to slacken his pace suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down
and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube then
he blew or called through them a great hoom hom rang out like a
deep-throated horn in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees far off
there came from several directions a similar hoom hom hoom that was not
an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and strode on again
every now and then sending out another horn-call and each time the answers came
louder and nearer in this way they came at last to what looked like an
impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of a kind that the hobbits had
never seen before: they branched out right from the roots and were densely clad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and they bore many stiff upright
flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treebeard came in a few
strides to a narrow entrance through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly
down a long steep slope the hobbits saw that they were descending into a great
dingle almost as round as a bowl very wide and deep crowned at the rim with
the high dark evergreen hedge it was smooth and grassclad inside and there
were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at
the bottom of the bowl two other paths led down into the dingle: from the west
and from the east
several ents had already arrived more were coming in down the other paths
and some were now following treebeard as they drew near the hobbits gazed at
them they had expected to see a number of creatures as much like treebeard as
one hobbit is like another at any rate to a strangers eye and they were very
much surprised to see nothing of the kind the ents were as different from one
another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of
the same name but quite different growth and history and some as different as
one tree-kind from another as birch from beech oak from fir there were a few
older ents bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees though none looked
as ancient as treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean-limbed and
smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime but there were no young ents
no saplings altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy
floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw:
the many shapes and colours the differences in girth and height and length
of leg and arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from three to
nine a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and reminded them of
beech-trees or oaks but there were other kinds some recalled the chestnut:
brown-skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs some
recalled the ash: tall straight grey ents with many-fingered hands and long
legs some the fir the tallest ents and others the birch the rowan and the
linden but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their heads
slightly murmuring in their slow musical voices and looking long and intently
at the strangers then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred
and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as treebeards but all
with the same slow steady thoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in a wide circle round
treebeard a curious and unintelligible conversation began the ents began to
murmur slowly: first one joined and then another until they were all chanting
together in a long rising and falling rhythm now louder on one side of the
ring now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side though
he could not catch or understand any of the words - he supposed the language was
entish - pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first but
gradually his attention wavered after a long time and the chant showed no
signs of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was such an
unhasty language whether they had yet got further than good morning
and if treebeard was to call the roll how many days it would take to sing all
their names i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he
thought he yawned
treebeard was immediately aware of him hm ha hey my pippin he
said and the other ents all stopped their chant you are a hasty folk i was
forgetting and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not
understand you may get down now i have told your names to the entmoot and
they have seen you and they have agreed that you are not orcs and that a new
line shall be put in the old lists we have got no further yet but that is
quick work for an entmoot you and merry can stroll about in the dingle if you
like there is a well of good water if you need refreshing away yonder in the
north bank there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins i
will come and see you again and tell you how things are going
he put the hobbits down before they walked away they bowed low this feat
seemed to amuse the ents very much to judge by the tone of their murmurs and
the flicker of their eyes but they soon turned back to their own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west and looked
through the opening in the great hedge long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip
of the dingle and away beyond them above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge
there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain southwards to their
left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance there
far away there was a pale green glimmer that merry guessed to be a glimpse of
the plains of rohan
i wonder where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but that peak is probably
methedras and as far as i can remember the ring of isengard lies in a fork or
deep cleft at the end of the mountains it is probably down behind this great
ridge there seems to be a smoke or haze over there left of the peak dont you
think
what is isengard like said pippin i wonder what ents can do about it
anyway
so do i said merry isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills i
think with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle
called orthanc saruman has a tower on it there is a gate perhaps more than
one in the encircling wall and i believe there is a stream running through it
it comes out of the mountains and flows on across the gap of rohan it does not
seem the sort of place for ents to tackle but i have an odd feeling about these
ents: somehow i dont think they are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet i believe they could
be roused if that happened i would rather not be on the other side
yes said pippin i know what you mean there might be all the difference
between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull charging and
the change might come suddenly i wonder if treebeard will rouse them i am sure
he means to try but they dont like being roused treebeard got roused himself
last night and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back the voices of the ents were still rising and falling
in their conclave the sun had now risen high enough to look over the high
hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward side of the
dingle with a cool yellow light there they saw a little glittering fountain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens-it was
pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again and not to be in a hurry-and
then they climbed down to the gushing water they drank a little a clean cold
sharp draught and sat down on a mossy stone watching the patches of sun on the
grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the
dingle the murmur of the ents went on it seemed a very strange and remote
place outside their world and far from everything that had ever happened to
them a great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their
companions especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent-voices and looking up they saw
treebeard coming towards them with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard are you getting weary or
feeling impatient hmm eh well i am afraid that you must not get impatient
yet we have finished the first stage now but i have still got to explain
things again to those that live a long way off far from isengard and those
that i could not get round to before the moot and after that we shall have to
decide what to do however deciding what to do does not take ents so long as
going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of days
very likely so i have brought you a companion he has an ent-house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name he says he has already made up his mind and does
not need to remain at the moot hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a
hasty ent you ought to get on together good-bye treebeard turned and left
them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly and they looked
at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness he was tall and
seemed to be one of the younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms and
legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey-green he could bend and sway
like a slender tree in the wind at last he spoke and his voice though resonant
was higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said i am bregalad that is
quickbeam in your language but it is only a nickname of course they have
called me that ever since i said yes to an elder ent before he had
finished his question also i drink quickly and go out while some are still
wetting their beards come with me
he reached down two shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand to each of the
hobbits all that day they walked about in the woods with him singing and
laughing for quickbeam often laughed he laughed if the sun came out from
behind a cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or spring: then he stooped
and splashed his feet and head with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or
whisper in the trees whenever he saw a rowan-tree he halted a while with his
arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than a mossy
stone set upon turves under a green bank rowan-trees grew in a circle about it
and there was water as in all ent-houses a spring bubbling out from the bank
they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest not far away the voices
of the entmoot could be heard still going on but now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high and
quickening music while all the others died away but beside them bregalad spoke
gently in their own tongue almost whispering and they learned that he belonged
to skinbarks people and the country where they had lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his hastiness at least in
the matter of orcs
there were rowan-trees in my home said bregalad softly and sadly
rowan-trees that took root when i was an enting many many years ago in the
quiet of the world the oldest were planted by the ents to try and please the
entwives but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where
whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing yet there are no trees of all that
race the people of the rose that are so beautiful to me and these trees grew
and grew till the shadow of each was like a green hall and their red berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder birds used to flock
there i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan has enough and to
spare but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at the trees and
threw the fruit down and did not eat it then orcs came with axes and cut down
my trees i came and called them by their long names but they did not quiver
they did not hear or answer: they lay dead
o orofarnë lassemista carnimírië

o rowan fair upon your hair how white the blossom lay

o rowan mine i saw you shine upon a summers day

your rind so bright your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft:

upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft

o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and grey

your crown is spilled your voice is stilled for ever and a day

o orofarnë lassemista carnimírië
the hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of bregalad that
seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in his company but they did not go far from his
house most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank for the
wind was colder and the clouds closer and greyer there was little sunshine
and in the distance the voices of the ents at the moot still rose and fell
sometimes loud and strong sometimes low and sad sometimes quickening
sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge a second night came and still the ents
held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third day broke bleak and windy at sunrise the ents voices rose to a
great clamour and then died down again as the morning wore on the wind fell and
the air grew heavy with expectancy the hobbits could see that bregalad was now
listening intently although to them down in the dell of his ent-house the
sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the mountains sent out
long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds suddenly they
were aware that everything was very quiet the whole forest stood in listening
silence of course the ent-voices had stopped what did that mean bregalad was
standing up erect and tense looking back northwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah the trees
quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them there was another pause and
then a marching music began like solemn drums and above the rolling beats and
booms there welled voices singing high and strong
we come we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom
the ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:
we come we come with horn and drum: ta-rûna
rûna rûna rom
bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house
before long they saw the marching line approaching: the ents were swinging
along with great strides down the slope towards them treebeard was at their
head and some fifty followers were behind him two abreast keeping step with
their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks as they drew
near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we come at last called treebeard
when he caught sight of bregalad and the hobbits come join the moot we are
off we are off to isengard
to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard
to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone

though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bone

we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door

for bole and bough are burning now the furnace roars - we go to war

to land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of drum we come we come
to isengard with doom we come
with doom we come with doom we come
so they sang as they marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into the line beside treebeard the old ent
now took the hobbits back and set them on his shoulders again and so they rode
proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held
high though they had expected something to happen eventually they were amazed
at the change that had come over the ents it seemed now as sudden as the
bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike
the ents made up their minds rather quickly after all didnt they pippin
ventured to say after some time when for a moment the singing paused and only
the beating of hands and feet was heard
quickly said treebeard hoom yes indeed quicker than i expected
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age we ents do not
like being roused and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our lives are in great danger that has not happened in this forest
since the wars of sauron and the men of the sea it is the orc-work the wanton
hewing - rárum - without even
the bad excuse of feeding the fires that has so angered us and the treachery
of a neighbour who should have helped us wizards ought to know better: they do
know better there is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues of men bad
enough for such treachery down with saruman
will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not know perhaps how strong we
are maybe you have heard of trolls they are mighty strong but trolls are only
counterfeits made by the enemy in the great darkness in mockery of ents as
orcs were of elves we are stronger than trolls we are made of the bones of the
earth we can split stone like the roots of trees only quicker far quicker if
our minds are roused if we are not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast of
sorcery we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into
rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so i have not forgotten it indeed i have thought long
about it but you see many of the ents are younger than i am by many lives of
trees they are all roused now and their mind is all on one thing: breaking
isengard but they will start thinking again before long they will cool down a
little when we take our evening drink what a thirst we shall have but let
them march now and sing we have a long way to go and there is time ahead for
thought it is something to have started
treebeard marched on singing with the others for a while but after a time
his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again pippin could see that his old
brow was wrinkled and knotted at last he looked up and pippin could see a sad
look in his eyes sad but not unhappy there was a light in them as if the
green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my friends he said slowly likely enough
that we are going to our doom: the last march of the ents but if we stayed at
home and did nothing doom would find us anyway sooner or later that thought
has long been growing in our hearts and that is why we are marching now it was
not a hasty resolve now at least the last march of the ents may be worth a
song aye he sighed we may help the other peoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs come true about the entwives i
should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil again but there my friends songs
like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes
they are withered untimely
the ents went striding on at a great pace they had descended into a long
fold of the land that fell away southward now they began to climb up and up
on to the high western ridge the woods fell away and they came to scattered
groups of birch and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew
the sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front grey dusk fell
pippin looked behind the number of the ents had grown - or what was
happening where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie he
thought he saw groves of trees but they were moving could it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was rising marching over the hills to
war he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him but the
great grey shapes moved steadily onward there was a noise like wind in many
branches the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now and all song
had ceased night fell and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a
faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ents and a rustle the shade
of a whisper as of many drifting leaves at last they stood upon the summit and
looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of
the mountains: nan curunír the valley of saruman
night lies over isengard said treebeard
 
my very bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his
feet day had come at last at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as
they could now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the
ground again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that old man said gimli i should be happier if i could
see the print of a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he
seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass
is deep and springy
that would not baffle a ranger said gimli a bent blade is enough for
aragorn to read but i do not expect him to find any traces it was an evil
phantom of saruman that we saw last night i am sure of it even under the light
of morning his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragorn yet i am not sure i am thinking of the
horses you said last night gimli that they were scared away but i did not
think so did you hear them legolas did they sound to you like beasts in
terror
no said legolas i heard them clearly but for the darkness and our own
fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read the riddle unless they
return come the light is growing fast let us look first and guess later we
should begin here near to our own camping-ground searching carefully all
about and working up the slope towards the forest to find the hobbits is our
errand whatever we may think of our visitor in the night if they escaped by
some chance then they must have hidden in the trees or they would have been
seen if we find nothing between here and the eaves of the wood then we will
make a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes but there is
little hope there: the horsemen of rohan did their work too well
for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground the tree
stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now hanging limp and rattling in
the chill easterly wind aragorn moved slowly away he came to the ashes of the
watch-fire near the river-bank and then began to retrace the ground back
towards the knoll where the battle had been fought suddenly he stooped and bent
low with his face almost in the grass then he called to the others they came
running up
here at last we find news said aragorn he lifted up a broken leaf for
them to see a large pale leaf of golden hue now fading and
turning brown here is a mallorn-leaf of lórien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grass and see there are some pieces
of cut cord lying nearby
and here is the knife that cut them said gimli he stooped and drew out of
a tussock into which some heavy foot had trampled it a short jagged blade the
haft from which it had been snapped was beside it it was an orc-weapon he
said holding it gingerly and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had
been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed
legolas a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding
horsemen he then stops while still in the open and cuts his bonds with an
orc-knife but how and why for if his legs were tied how did he walk and if
his arms were tied how did he use the knife and if neither were tied why did
he cut the cords at all being pleased with his skill he then sat down and
quietly ate some waybread that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit
without the mallorn-leaf after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees it should be easy to find him: we only
need wings ourselves
there was sorcery here right enough said gimli what was that old man
doing what have you to say aragorn to the reading of legolas can you better
it
maybe i could said aragorn smiling there are some other signs near at
hand that you have not considered i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and
must have had either legs or hands free before he came here i guess that it
was hands because the riddle then becomes easier and also because as i read
the marks he was carried to this point by an orc blood was spilled
there a few paces away orc-blood there are deep prints of hoofs all about
this spot and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away the orc was slain by
horsemen and later his body was hauled to the fire but the hobbit was not
seen: he was not "in the open" for it was night and he still had his
elven-cloak he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to be wondered at that
when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy he rested and ate
a little before he crept away but it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas
in his pocket even though he ran away without gear or pack that perhaps is
like a hobbit i say he though i hope and guess that both merry and
pippin were here together there is however nothing to show that for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free
asked gimli
i do not know how it happened answered aragorn nor do i know why an orc
was carrying them away not to help them to escape we may be sure nay rather
i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the
beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of
merry and pippin they did not seek out the rest of us nor attack our camp but
instead they went with all speed towards isengard did they suppose they had
captured the ring-bearer and his faithful comrade i think not their masters
would not dare to give such plain orders to orcs even if they knew so much
themselves they would not speak openly to them of the ring: they are not trusty
servants but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture hobbits
alive at all costs an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners
before the battle treachery perhaps likely enough with such folk some large
and bold orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone for his own
ends there that is my tale others might be devised but on this we may count
in any case: one at least of our friends escaped it is our task to find him and
help him before we return to rohan we must not be daunted by fangorn since
need drove him into that dark place
i do not know which daunts me more: fangorn or the thought of the long road
through rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs at one point near the bank
of the entwash he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints but too light for much
to be made of them then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge
of the wood more prints were discovered the earth was bare and dry and did not
reveal much
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back and then he
turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli but i do not like the look of this
fangorn: and we were warned against it i wish the chase had led anywhere else
i do not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said legolas
he stood under the eaves of the forest stooping forward as if he were
listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows no it is not evil or
what evil is in it is far away i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places
where the hearts of the trees are black there is no malice near us but there
is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli i have done it no
harm 
that is just as well said legolas but nonetheless it has suffered harm
there is something happening inside or going to happen do you not feel the
tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf this wood is lighter than
mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said the elf so old that almost i feel young again
as i have not felt since i journeyed with you children it is old and full of
memory i could have been happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli you are a wood-elf anyway though
elves of any kind are strange folk yet you comfort me where you go i will go
but keep your bow ready to hand and i will keep my axe loose in my belt not
for use on trees he added hastily looking up at the tree under which they
stood i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready
to hand that is all let us go
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn legolas and
gimli left the tracking to aragorn there was little for him to see the floor
of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves but guessing that the
fugitives would stay near the water he returned often to the banks of the
stream so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk
and bathed their feet there plain for all to see were the footprints of two
hobbits one somewhat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said aragorn yet the marks are two days old and it
seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side
then what shall we do now said gimli we cannot pursue them through the
whole fastness of fangorn we have come ill supplied if we do not find them
soon we shall be of no use to them except to sit down beside them and show our
friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then we must do that said aragorn let
us go on
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeards hill and looked up
at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf gleams of sun
were striking through the hurrying clouds and the forest now looked less grey
and drear
let us go up and look about us said legolas i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up aragorn came last moving slowly: he was scanning
the steps and ledges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here he said but there
are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand i wonder if we
can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went
next
he stood up and looked about but he saw nothing that was of any use the
shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the east was the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain
from which they had come
we have journeyed a long way round said legolas we could have all come
here safe together if we had left the great river on the second or third day
and struck west few can foresee whither their road will lead them till they
come to its end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net said legolas look
look at what said gimli
there in the trees
where i have not elf-eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointing down in the wood
back in the way that we have just come it is he cannot you see him passing
from tree to tree
i see i see now hissed gimli look aragorn did i not warn you there
is the old man all in dirty grey rags: that is why i could not see him at
first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar-man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff his
head was bowed and he did not look towards them in other lands they would have
greeted him with kind words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power-or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step by step the figure drew
nearer then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out: your
bow legolas bend it get ready it is saruman do not let him speak or put a
spell upon us shoot first
legolas took his bow and bent it slowly and as if some other will resisted
him he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are you waiting what is the matter with you said gimli in a hissing
whisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly we may not shoot an old man so at
unawares and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us watch and wait
at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed
to the foot of the rock-wall then suddenly he looked up while they stood
motionless looking down there was no sound
they could not see his face: he was hooded and above the hood he wore a
wide-brimmed hat so that all his features were over-shadowed except for the
end of his nose and his grey beard yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the
gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence well met indeed my friends he said
in a soft voice i wish to speak to you will you come down or shall i come
up without waiting for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli stop him legolas
did i not say that i wished to speak to you said the old man put away
that bow master elf
the bow and arrow fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his
sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your axe-haft till i am up
you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stood still as stone staring while the old man
sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat all weariness seemed to have left
him as he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam too brief for
certainty a quick glint of white as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags
had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis breath could be heard as
a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them when he was a
few feet away he stood stooping over his staff with his head thrust forward
peering at them from under his hood and what may you be doing in these parts
an elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion no doubt there is a tale
worth hearing behind it all such things are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well said aragorn is that so
not well said the old man: that would be the study of many lives but i
come here now and again
might we know your name and then hear what it is that you have to say to
us said aragorn the morning passes and we have an errand that will not
wait
as for what i wished to say i have said it: what may you be doing and what
tale can you tell of yourselves as for my name he broke off laughing long
and softly aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound a strange cold
thrill and yet it was not fear or terror that he felt: rather it was like the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy
sleeper
my name said the old man again have you not guessed it already you have
heard it before i think yes you have heard it before but come now what of
your tale
the three companions stood silent and made no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell
said the old man happily i know something of it you are tracking the
footsteps of two young hobbits i believe yes hobbits dont stare as if you
had never heard the strange name before you have and so have i well they
climbed up here the day before yesterday and they met someone that they did not
expect does that comfort you and now you would like to know where they were
taken well well maybe i can give you some news about that but why are we
standing your errand you see is no longer as urgent as you thought let us
sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at
the foot of the cliff behind immediately as if a spell had been removed the
others relaxed and stirred gimlis hand went at once to his axe-haft aragorn
drew his sword legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond doubt that he was clothed
beneath all in white
saruman cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand speak tell
us where you have hidden our friends what have you done with them speak or i
will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with
the old man was too quick for him he sprang to his feet and leaped to the
top of a large rock there he stood grown suddenly tall towering above them
his hood and his grey rags were flung away his white garments shone he lifted
up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the
ground the sword of aragorn stiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden
fire legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it
vanished in a flash of flame
mithrandir he cried mithrandir
well met i say to you again legolas said the old man
they all gazed at him his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes under his deep brows were bright piercing
as the rays of the sun power was in his hand between wonder joy and fear
they stood and found no words to say
at last aragorn stirred gandalf he said beyond all hope you return to
us in our need what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing hut
sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalling from old memory a long
disused word yes that was the name i was gandalf
he stepped down from the rock and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about
him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you may still call me gandalf he said and the voice was the voice of
their old friend and guide get up my good gimli no blame to you and no harm
done to me indeed my friends none of you have any weapon that could hurt me
be merry we meet again at the turn of the tide the great storm is coming but
the tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the dwarf looked up and laughed
suddenly gandalf he said but you are all in white
yes i am white now said gandalf indeed i am saruman one might
almost say saruman as he should have been but come now tell me of yourselves
i have passed through fire and deep water since we parted i have forgotten
much that i thought i knew and learned again much that i had forgotten i can
see many things far off but many things that are close at hand i cannot see
tell me of yourselves
what do you wish to know said aragorn all that has happened since we
parted on the bridge would be a long tale will you not first give us news of
the hobbits did you find them and are they safe
no i did not find them said gandalf there was a darkness over the
valleys of the emyn muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle
told me
the eagle said legolas i have seen an eagle high and far off: the last
time was three days ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from
orthanc i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings his sight
is keen but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree some things he
has seen and others i have seen myself the ring now has passed beyond my help
or the help of any of the company that set out from rivendell very nearly it
was revealed to the enemy but it escaped i had some part in that: for i sat in
a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadow passed then i
was weary very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli how do things go with him
i cannot say he was saved from a great peril but many lie before him
still he resolved to go alone to mordor and he set out: that is all that i can
say
not alone said legolas we think that sam went with him
did he said gandalf and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his
face did he indeed it is news to me yet it does not surprise me good very
good you lighten my heart you must tell me more now sit by me and tell me the
tale of your journey
the companions sat on the ground at his feet and aragorn took up the tale
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no questions his hands were
spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed at last when aragorn spoke of
the death of boromir and of his last journey upon the great river the old man
sighed
you have not said all that you know or guess aragorn my friend he said
quietly poor boromir i could not see what happened to him it was a sore
trial for such a man: a warrior and a lord of men galadriel told me that he
was in peril but he escaped in the end i am glad it was not in vain that the
young hobbits came with us if only for boromirs sake but that is not the only
part they have to play they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains even as
we talk here i hear the first rumblings saruman had best not be caught away
from home when the dam bursts
in one thing you have not changed dear friend said aragorn: you still
speak in riddles
what in riddles said gandalf no for i was talking aloud to myself a
habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to the long
explanations needed by the young are wearying he laughed but the sound now
seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even in the reckoning of men of the ancient houses
said aragorn will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused for a while in thought
this in brief is how i see things at the moment if you wish to have a piece of
my mind as plain as possible the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit he knows now the number of our
company that set out from rivendell and the kind of each of us but he does not
yet perceive our purpose clearly he supposes that we were all going to minas
tirith for that is what he would himself have done in our place and according
to his wisdom it would have been a heavy stroke against his power indeed he is
in great fear not knowing what mighty one may suddenly appear wielding the
ring and assailing him with war seeking to cast him down and take his place
that we should wish to cast him down and have no one in his place is not a
thought that occurs to his mind that we should try to destroy the ring itself
has not yet entered into his darkest dream in which no doubt you will see our
good fortune and our hope for imagining war he has let loose war believing
that he has no time to waste for he that strikes the first blow if he strikes
it hard enough may need to strike no more so the forces that he has long been
preparing he is now setting in motion sooner than he intended wise fool for
if he had used all his power to guard mordor so that none could enter and bent
all his guild to the hunting of the ring then indeed hope would have faded:
neither ring nor bearer could long have eluded him but now his eye gazes abroad
rather than near at home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith very soon
now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the company
have failed again they have not found the ring neither have they brought away
any hobbits as hostages had they done even so much as that it would have been
a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal but let us not darken our
hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower for the
enemy has failed-so far thanks to saruman:
then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
indeed yes said gandalf doubly and is not that strange nothing that we
have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard even
reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong he threatens the
men of rohan and draws off their help from minas tirith even as the main blow
is approaching from the east yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the
hand saruman also had a mind to capture the ring for himself or at least to
snare some hobbits for his evil purposes so between them our enemies have
contrived only to bring merry and pippin with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwise they would never have come at all
also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the battle will come to mordor thanks to the horsemen of rohan
but the dark lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and borne
away towards isengard against the will of his own servants he now has isengard
to fear as well as minas tirith if minas tirith falls it will go ill with
saruman
it is a pity that our friends lie in between said gimli if no land
divided isengard and mordor then they could fight while we watched and waited
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said
gandalf but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains the
ring that he will never do now he does not yet know his peril there is much
that he does not know he was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he
could not wait at home and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers
but he came too late for once and the battle was over and beyond his help
before he reached these parts he did not remain here long i look into his mind
and i see his doubt he has no woodcraft he believes that the horsemen slew and
burned all upon the field of battle but he does not know whether the orcs were
bringing any prisoners or not and he does not know of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor does he know of the winged messenger
the winged messenger cried legolas i shot at him with the bow of
galadriel above sarn gebir and i felled him from the sky he filled us all with
fear what new terror is this
one that you cannot slay with arrows said
gandalf you only slew his steed it was a good deed but the rider was soon
horsed again for he was a nazgûl one of the nine who ride now upon
winged steeds soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of our friends
cutting off the sun but they have not yet been allowed to cross the river and
saruman does not know of this new shape in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the ring was it present in the battle was it found
what if théoden lord of the mark should come by it and learn of
its power that is the danger that he sees and he has fled back to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan and all the time there is another
danger close at hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts he
has forgotten treebeard
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile treebeard is
not known to me and i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet i do
not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to fangorn has served save to
give us a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli there is another thing that i should like to
know first was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last night
you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore i must guess
that you saw saruman evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make
an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli i am glad that it was not you
gandalf laughed again yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort not to
be mistaken at all points do i not know it only too well but of course i
never blamed you for your welcome of me how could i do so who have so often
counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with
the enemy bless you gimli son of glóin maybe you will see us both
together one day and judge between us
but the hobbits legolas broke in we have come far to seek them and you
seem to know where they are where are they now
with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
the ents exclaimed aragorn then there is truth in the old legends about
the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees are there
still ents in the world i thought they were only a memory of ancient days if
indeed they were ever more than a legend of rohan
a legend of rohan cried legolas nay every elf in wilderland has sung
songs of the old onodrim and their long sorrow yet even among us they are only
a memory if i were to meet one still walking in this world then indeed i
should feel young again but treebeard: that is only a rendering of fangorn into
the common speech yet you seem to speak of a person who is this treebeard
ah now you are asking much said gandalf the little that i know of his
long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now treebeard is
fangorn the guardian of the forest he is the oldest of the ents the oldest
living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this middle-earth i hope
indeed legolas that you may yet meet him merry and pippin have been
fortunate: they met him here even where we sit for he came here two days ago
and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains he
often comes here especially when his mind is uneasy and rumours of the world
outside trouble him i saw him four days ago striding among the trees and i
think he saw me for he paused but i did not speak for i was heavy with
thought and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor and he did not
speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought that you were saruman said gimli but you speak
of him as if he was a friend i thought fangorn was dangerous
dangerous cried gandalf and so am i very dangerous: more dangerous
than anything you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before the seat
of the dark lord and aragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous you are
beset with dangers gimli son of glóin for you are dangerous yourself
in your own fashion certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous-not
least to those that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himself he is
perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless but now his long slow wrath
is brimming over and all the forest is filled with it the coming of the
hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be
running like a flood but its tide is turned against saruman and the axes of
isengard a thing is about to happen which has not happened since the elder
days: the ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf i do not think they know themselves i
wonder he fell silent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at him a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled with light as
a cup is with water at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing away he said soon we must go
do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandalf that is not the road that you must take i have spoken
words of hope but only of hope hope is not victory war is upon us and all our
friends a war in which only the use of the ring could give us surety of
victory it fills me with great sorrow and great fear: for much shall be
destroyed and all may be lost i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is
mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyes as if he saw things far
away that none of them could see then he shook his head no he said in a
soft voice it has gone beyond our reach of that at least let us be glad we
can no longer be tempted to use the ring we must go down to face a peril near
despair yet that deadly peril is removed
he turned come aragorn son of arathorn he said do not regret your
choice in the valley of the emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit you chose
amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice
was just and it has been rewarded for so we have met in time who otherwise
might have met too late but the quest of your companions is over your next
journey is marked by your given word you must go to edoras and seek out théoden
in his hall for you are needed the light of andúril must now be
uncovered in the battle for which it has so long waited there is war in rohan
and worse evil: it goes ill with théoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so said gandalf who knows have patience go where you
must go and hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to walk young or old said aragorn i fear the
battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf will you come now with me
yes we will set out together said aragorn but i do not doubt that you
will come there before me if you wish he rose and looked long at gandalf the
others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one another the grey
figure of the man aragorn son of arathorn was tall and stern as stone his
hand upon the hilt of his sword he looked as if some king out of the mists of
the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men before him stooped the old
figure white shining now as if with some light kindled within bent laden
with years but holding a power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last that you could go
whithersoever you wished quicker than i and this i also say: you are our
captain and our banner the dark lord has nine but we have one mightier than
they: the white rider he has passed through the fire and the abyss and they
shall fear him we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas but first it would ease
my heart gandalf to hear what befell you in moria will you not tell us can
you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered
i have stayed already too long answered gandalf time is short but if
there were a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli come gandalf
tell us how you fared with the balrog
name him not said gandalf and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain
passed over his face and he sat silent looking old as death long time i
fell he said at last slowly as if thinking back with difficulty long i
fell and he fell with me his fire was about me i was burned then we plunged
into the deep water and all was dark cold it was as the tide of death: almost
it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins bridge and none has measured
it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf thither i
came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone he was with me still his
fire was quenched but now he was a thing of slime stronger than a strangling
snake
we fought far under the living earth where time is not counted ever he
clutched me and ever i hewed him till at last he
fled into dark tunnels they were not made by durins folk gimli son of glóin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwarves the world is gnawed by
nameless things even sauron knows them not they are older than he now i have
walked there but i will bring no report to darken the light of day in that
despair my enemy was my only hope and i pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of khazad-dûm: too well
he knew them all ever up now we went until we came to the endless
stair
long has that been lost said gimli many have said that it was never made
save in legend but others say that it was destroyed
it was made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf from the lowest
dungeon to the highest peak it climbed ascending in unbroken spiral in many
thousand steps until it issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirak-zigil the pinnacle of the silvertine
there upon celebdil was a lonely window in the snow and before it lay a
narrow space a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world the sun shone fiercely
there but all below was wrapped in cloud out he sprang and even as i came
behind he burst into new flame there was none to see or perhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak suddenly gandalf laughed
but what would they say in song those that looked up from afar thought that
the mountain was crowned with storm thunder they heard and lightning they
said smote upon celebdil and leaped back broken into tongues of fire is not
that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam ice fell like rain
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the high place and broke the
mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin then darkness took me and i
strayed out of thought and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not
tell
naked i was sent back - for a brief time until my task is done and naked i
lay upon the mountain-top the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window
gone the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone i was alone
forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world there i lay staring
upward while the stars wheeled over and each day was as long as a life-age of
the earth faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all lands: the springing
and the dying the song and the weeping and the slow everlasting groan of
overburdened stone and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me again and
he took me up and bore me away
 ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
 a burden you have been he answered but not so now light as a swans
feather in my claw you are the sun shines through you indeed i do not think
you need me any more: were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
 do not let me fall i gasped for i felt life in me again bear me to
lothlórien
 that indeed is the command of the lady galadriel who sent me to look for
you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and found you but lately gone i
tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring healing not
decay healing i found and i was clothed in white counsel i gave and counsel
took thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to some of you to
aragorn i was bidden to say this:
where now are the dúnedain elessar elessar

why do thy kinsfolk wander afar

near is the hour when the lost should come forth

and the grey company ride from the north

but dark is the path appointed for thee:

the dead watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word:
legolas greenleaf long under tree

in joy thou hast lived beware of the sea

if thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore

thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message said gimli and bent his head
dark are her words said legolas and little do they mean to those that
receive them
that is no comfort said gimli
what then said legolas would you have her speak openly to you of your
death
yes if she had nought else to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes yes i think i can guess
what her words may mean your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once
again but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
 "to gimli son of glóin" she said "give his ladys
greeting lock-bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee but have a
care to lay thine axe to the right tree" 
in happy hour you have returned to us gandalf cried the dwarf capering
as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue come come he shouted
swinging his axe since gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one that it
is right to cleave
that will not be far to seek said gandalf rising from his seat come we
have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted friends now
there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the way
following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back
through the forest down the bank of the entwash they spoke no more words
until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn there was no
sign of their horses to be seen
they have not returned said legolas it will be a weary walk
i shall not walk time presses said gandalf then lifting up his head he
gave a long whistle so clear and piercing was the note that the others stood
amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips three times he
whistled and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the
whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind they waited
wondering before long there came the sound of hoofs at first hardly more than
a tremor of the ground perceptible only to aragorn as he lay upon the grass
then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
certainly said gandalf we are too great a burden for one
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain see how they
run there is hasufel and there is my friend arod beside him but there is
another that strides ahead: a very great horse i have not seen his like
before
nor will you again said gandalf that is shadowfax he is the chief of
the mearas lords of horses and not even théoden
king of rohan has ever looked on a better does he not shine like silver and
run as smoothly as a swift stream he has come for me: the horse of the
white rider we are going to battle together
even as the old wizard spoke the great horse came striding up the slope
towards them his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his
speed the two others followed now far behind as soon as shadowfax saw
gandalf he checked his pace and whinnied loudly then trotting gently forward
he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old mans
neck
gandalf caressed him it is a long way from rivendell my friend he said
but you are wise and swift and come at need far let us ride now together and
part not in this world again
soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to meduseld the hall of your
master théoden said gandalf addressing them gravely they bowed their
heads time presses so with your leave my friends we will ride we beg you
to use all the speed that you can hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli before me and by his leave shadowfax shall bear us
both we will wait now only to drink a little
now i understand a part of last nights riddle said legolas as he sprang
lightly upon arods back whether they fled at first in fear or not our
horses met shadowfax their chieftain and greeted him with joy did you know
that he was at hand gandalf
yes i knew said the wizard i bent my thought upon him bidding him to
make haste for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land swiftly may
he bear me back again
gandalf spoke now to shadowfax and the horse set off at a good pace yet not
beyond the measure of the others after a little while he turned suddenly and
choosing a place where the banks were lower he waded the river and then led
them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide the wind went like grey
waves through the endless miles of grass there was no sign of road or track
but shadowfax did not stay or falter
he is steering a straight course now for the halls of
théoden under the slopes of the white mountains said gandalf it will
be quicker so the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief northward
track lies across the river but shadowfax knows the way through every fen and
hollow
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands often the grass
was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders and their steeds
seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea they came upon many hidden pools and
broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs but shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed in his swath slowly the sun fell from
the sky down into the west looking out over the great plain far away the
riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass low upon the
edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side a smoke
seemed to rise up and darken the suns disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan said gandalf it is now almost due west of
us that way lies isengard
i see a great smoke said legolas what may that be
battle and war said gandalf ride on
 
they rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering night when at last
they halted and dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary gandalf only
allowed them a few hours rest legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat
stretched upon his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing into
the darkness east and west all was silent and there was no sign or sound of
living thing the night was barred with long clouds fleeting on a chill wind
when they arose again under the cold moon they went on once more as swift as
by the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on gimli nodded and would have fallen from
his seat if gandalf had not clutched and shaken him hasufel and arod weary
but proud followed their tireless leader a grey shadow before them hardly to
he seen the miles went by the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter chill came into the air slowly in the east the dark faded to a cold
grey red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the emyn muil far away
upon their left dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across their path
rushing through the bent grasses suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
gandalf pointed ahead
look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes before them stood the
mountains of the south: white-tipped and streaked with black the grass-lands
rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet and flowed up into many
valleys still dim and dark untouched by the light of dawn winding their way
into the heart of the great mountains immediately before the travellers the
widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills far inward they
glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one tall peak at the mouth of the vale
there stood like sentinel a lonely height about its feet there flowed as a
thread of silver the stream that issued from the dale upon its brow they
caught still far away a glint in the rising sun a glimmer of gold speak
legolas said gandalf tell us what you see there before us
legolas gazed ahead shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new-risen
sun i see a white stream that comes down from the snows he said where it
issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon the east a dike and
mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it within there rise the roofs of houses
and in the midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of
men and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold the light of it
shines far over the land golden too are the posts of its doors there men in
bright mail stand but all else within the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden
hall there dwells théoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan we
are come with the rising of the day now the road lies plain to see
before us but we must ride more warily for war is abroad and the rohirrim
the horse-lords do not sleep even if it seem so from afar draw no weapon
speak no haughty word i counsel you all until we are come before
théodens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and birds were singing when the
travellers came to the stream it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond
the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend flowing away east
to feed the entwash far off in its reed-choked beds the land was green: in the
wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow-trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips
feeling the approach of spring over the stream there was a ford between low
banks much trampled by the passage of horses the travellers passed over and
came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many mounds
high and green upon their western sides the grass was white as with a drifted
snow: small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the turf
look said gandalf how fair are the bright eyes in the grass evermind
they are called simbelmynë
in this land of men for they blossom in all the seasons of the year and grow
where dead men rest behold we are come to the great barrows where the sires of
théoden sleep seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right
said aragorn many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was
built
five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in mirkwood in my home since
then said legolas and but a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems so long ago said aragorn that the
raising of this house is but a memory of song and the years before are lost in
the mist of time now they call this land their home their own and their
speech is sundered from their northern kin then he began to chant softly in a
slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened for there was a
strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said legolas for it is
like to this land itself rich and rolling in part and else hard and stern as
the mountains but i cannot guess what it means save that it is laden with the
sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn as near as i can make it
where now the horse and the rider where is the horn that was blowing

where is the helm and the hauberk and the bright hair flowing

where is the hand on the harpstring and the red fire glowing

where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing

they have passed like rain on the mountain like a wind in the meadow

the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow

who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning

or behold the flowing years from the sea returning
thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how tall and fair
was eorl the young who rode down out of the north
and there were wings upon the feet of his steed felaróf father of
horses so men still sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds following the
winding way up the green shoulders of the hills they came at last to the wide
wind-swept walls and the gates of edoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprang at once to their feet and
barred the way with spears stay strangers here unknown they cried in the
tongue of the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness and they looked darkly upon
gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the same language yet
few strangers do so why then do you not speak in the common tongue as is the
custom in the west if you wish to be answered
it is the will of théoden king that none should enter his gates save
those who know our tongue and are our friends replied one of the guards none
are welcome here in days of war but our own folk and those that come
from mundburg in the land of gondor who are you that come heedless over the
plain thus strangely clad riding horses like to our own horses long have we
kept guard here and we have watched you from afar never have we seen other
riders so strange nor any horse more proud than is one of these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell say
are you not a wizard some spy from saruman or phantoms of his craft speak now
and be swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do your eyes cheat you for indeed
these are your own horses that we ride as you knew well are you asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable here are hasufel and arod
that éomer the third marshal of the mark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back now even as we promised him has not éomer then
returned and given warning of our coming
a troubled look came into the guards eyes of éomer i have naught to
say he answered if what you tell me is truth then doubtless théoden
will have heard of it maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for it is but
two nights ago that wormtongue came to us and said that by the will of théoden
no stranger should pass these gates
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard say no more my
errand is not to wormtongue but to the lord of the mark himself i am in haste
will you not go or send to say that we are come his eyes glinted under his
deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly but what names shall i report and
what shall i say of you old and weary you seem now and yet you are fell and
grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard for i am gandalf i have
returned and behold i too bring back a horse here is shadowfax the great
whom no other hand can tame and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundburg that he goes here also are legolas the elf
and gimli the dwarf our comrades go now and say to your master that we are at
his gates and would have speech with him if he will permit us to come into his
hall strange names you give indeed but i will report them as you bid and
learn my masters will said the guard wait here a little while and f will
bring you such answer as seems good to him do not hope too much these are dark
days he went swiftly away leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of
his comrades after some time he returned follow
me he said théoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that you
bear be it only a staff you must leave on the threshold the doorwardens will
keep them
the dark gates were swung open the travellers entered walking in file
behind their guide they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now winding
upward now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps many houses built of
wood and many dark doors they passed beside the way in a stone channel a stream
of clear water flowed sparkling and chattering at length they came to the
crown of the hill there stood a high platform above a green terrace at the
foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone carved in the likeness of a
horses head beneath was a wide basin from which the water spilled and fed the
falling stream up the green terrace went a stair of stone high and broad and
on either side of the topmost step were stone-hewn sea there sat other guards
with drawn swords laid upon their knees their golden hair was braided on their
shoulders the sun was blazoned upon their green shields their long corslets
were burnished bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide i must return now to my
duty at the gate farewell and may the lord of the mark be gracious to you
he turned and went swiftly back down the road the others climbed the long
stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen silent they stood now above and spoke
no word until gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own
tongue
hail corners from afar they said and they turned the hilts of their
swords towards the travellers in token of peace green gems flashed in the
sunlight then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of théoden he said háma is my name here
i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave into his hand his
silver-hafted knife his quiver and his bow keep these well he said for
they come from the golden wood and the lady of lothlórien gave them to
me
wonder came into the mans eyes and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall
as if he feared to handle them no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitating it is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver andúril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of théoden said háma
it is not clear to me that the will of théoden son of thengel even
though he be lord of the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son of
arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the house of théoden not of aragorn even were he king of
gondor in the seat of denethor said háma stepping swiftly before the
doors and barring the way his sword was now in his hand and the point towards
the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf needless is théodens demand but
it is useless to refuse a king will have his way in his own hall be it
folly or wisdom
truly said aragorn and i would do as the master of the house bade me
were this only a woodmans cot if i bore now any sword but andúril
whatever its name may be said háma here you shall lay it
if you would not fight alone against all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingering the blade of his axe and looking darkly
up at the guard as if he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell not
alone
come come said gandalf we are all friends here or should be for the
laughter of mordor will be our only reward if we quarrel my errand is
pressing here at least is my sword goodman
háma keep it well glamdring it is called for the elves made it long ago
now let me pass come aragorn
slowly aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright against
the wall here i set it he said but i command you not to touch it nor to
permit any other to lay hand on it in this elvish heath dwells the blade that
was broken and has been made again telchar first wrought it in the deeps of
time death shall come to any man that draws elendils sword save elendils
heir
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn it seems that
you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said it shall
be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has andúril to keep it company my axe may
stay here too without shame and he laid it on the floor now then if all
is as you wish let us go and speak with your master
the guard still hesitated your staff he said to gandalf forgive me but
that too must be left at the doors
foolishness said gandalf prudence is one thing but discourtesy is
another i am old if i may not lean on my stick as
i go then i will sit out here until it pleases théoden to hobble out
himself to speak with me
aragorn laughed every man has something too dear to trust to another but
would you part an old man from his support come will you not let us enter
the staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age said háma
he looked hard at the ash-staff on which gandalf leaned yet in doubt a man of
worth will trust to his own wisdom i believe you are friends and folk worthy
of honour who have no evil purpose you may go in
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly
inwards grumbling on their great hinges the travellers entered inside it
seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill the hall was long and
wide and filled with shadows and half lights mighty pillars upheld its lofty
roof but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the
eastern windows high under the deep eaves through the louver in the roof
above the thin wisps of issuing smoke the sky showed pale and blue as their
eyes changed the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with stones of
many hues branching runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now that the pillars were richly carved gleaming dully with gold and
half-seen colours many woven cloths were hung upon the walls and over their
wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim with years some
darkling in the shade but upon one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a
white horse he was blowing a great horn and his yellow hair was flying in the
wind the horses head was lifted and its nostrils were wide and red as it
neighed smelling battle afar foaming water green and white rushed and curled
about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn thus he rode out of the north to the
battle of the field of celebrant
now the four companions went forward past the clear wood-fire burning upon
the long hearth in the midst of the hall then they halted at the far end of
the house beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair upon it sat
a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was
long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circle set
upon his brow in the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond his
beard was laid like snow upon his knees but his eyes still burned with a bright
light glinting as he gazed at the strangers behind his chair stood a woman
clad in white at his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man with a
pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes
there was a silence the old man did not move in his
chair at length gandalf spoke hail théoden son of thengel i have
returned for behold the storm comes and now all friends should gather
together lest each singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning heavily upon a short black staff
with a handle of white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though he was
he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he said and maybe you look for welcome but truth to tell
your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf you have ever been a herald of
woe troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse i will not
deceive you: when i heard that shadowfax had come back riderless i rejoiced at
the return of the horse but still more at the lack
of the rider and when éomer brought the tidings that you had gone at
last to your long home i did not mourn but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils worse than before as might be
expected why should i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale man sitting upon the steps of the
dais it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that théodred
your son was slain upon the west marches: your right hand second marshal of the
mark in éomer there is little trust few men would be left to guard your
walls if he had been allowed to rule and even now we learn from gondor that
the dark lord is stirring in the east such is the hour in which this
wanderer chooses to return why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow láthspell
i name you ill-news and ill news is an ill guest they say he laughed grimly
as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark
eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless a great support
to your master answered gandalf in a soft voice yet in two ways may a man
come with evil tidings lie may be a worker of evil or he may be such as leaves
well alone and comes only to bring aid in time of need
that is so said wormtongue but there is a third kind: pickers of bones
meddlers in other mens sorrows carrion-fowl that grow fat on war what aid
have you ever brought stormcrow and what aid do you bring now it was aid from
us that you sought last time that you were here then my lord bade you choose
any horse that you would and be gone and to the wonder of all you took
shadowfax in your insolence my lord was sorely grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too great i guess that it is
likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears that i would call aid
that is our present need but who are these that follow at your tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late théoden son
of thengel said gandalf has not the messenger from your gate reported
the names of my companions seldom has any lord of rohan received three such
guests weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal man
even the mightiest grey is their raiment for the elves clad them and thus
they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as éomer reported that you are in league with the
sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue it is not to be wondered at:
webs of deceit were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but felt suddenly the hand of gandalf clutch him
by the shoulder and he halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lórien

seldom have walked the feet of men

few mortal eyes have seen the light

that lies there ever long and bright

galadriel galadriel

clear is the water of your well

white is the star in your white hand

unmarred unstained is leaf and land

in dwimordene in lórien

more fair than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he
changed casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned no longer on
his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice the wise speak only of what they
know gríma son of gálmód a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth i
have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man
till the lightning falls he raised his staff there was a roll of thunder the
sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows the whole hall became
suddenly dark as night the fire faded to sullen embers only gandalf could be
seen standing white and tall before the blackened hearth
in the gloom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice: did i not counsel
you lord to forbid his staff that fool háma
has betrayed us there was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof then
all was silent wormtongue sprawled on his face
now théoden son of thengel will you hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through the opening could be seen high
and far a patch of shining sky not all is dark take courage lord of the
mark for better help you will not find no counsel have i to give to those that
despair yet counsel i could give and words i could speak to you will you hear
them they are not for all ears i bid you come out before your doors and look
abroad too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to twisted tales and
crooked promptings
slowly théoden left his chair a faint light grew in the hall again
the woman hastened to the kings side taking his arm and with faltering steps
the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall wormtongue
remained lying on the floor they came to the doors and gandalf knocked
open he cried the lord of the mark comes forth
the doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in a wind was blowing on
the hill send your guards down to the stairs foot said gandalf and you
lady leave him a while with me i will care for him
go éowyn sister-daughter said the old king the time for fear is
past
the woman turned and went slowly into the house as she passed the doors she
turned and looked back grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on
the king with cool pity in her eyes very fair was her face and her long hair
was like a river of gold slender and tall she was in her white robe girt with
silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a
daughter of kings thus aragorn for the first time in the full light of day
beheld éowyn lady of rohan and thought her fair fair and cold like a
morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood and she now was
suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings wise with many winters
greycloaked hiding a power that yet she felt for a moment still as stone she
stood then turning swiftly she was gone
now lord said gandalf look out upon your land breathe the free air
again
from the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond the
stream the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey curtains of
wind-blown rain were slanting down the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thunder and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and already the storm that had come out
of the east was receding rolling away southward to the sea suddenly through a
rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down the falling showers
gleamed like silver and far away the river glittered like a shimmering glass
it is not so dark here said théoden
no said gandalf nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as some
would have you think cast aside your prop
from the kings hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones he drew
himself up slowly as a man that is stiff from long bending over some dull
toil now tall and straight he stood and his eyes were blue as he looked into
the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but i feel as one new-awakened
i would now that you had come before gandalf for i fear that already you have
come too late only to see the last days of my house not long now shall stand
the high hall which brego son of eorl built fire shall devour the high seat
what is to be done
much said gandalf but first send for éomer do i not guess
rightly that you hold him prisoner by the counsel of gríma of him that
all save you name the wormtongue
it is true said théoden he had rebelled against my commands and
threatened death to gríma in my hall
a man may love you and yet not love wormtongue or his counsels said
gandalf
that may be i will do as you ask call háma to me since he proved
untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand-runner the guilty shall bring
the guilty to judgement said théoden and his voice was grim yet he
looked at gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed
away and did not return
when háma had been summoned and had gone gandalf led théoden
to a stone seat and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hear said gandalf yet if my
hope is not cheated a time will come ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of wormtongue could
weave into your dreams but see you dream no longer you live gondor and rohan
do not stand alone the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have a hope
at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke his voice was low and secret and none save the
king heard what he said but ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in théodens
eye and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height and gandalf
beside him and together they looked out from the high place towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and clear that way lies
our hope where sits our greatest fear doom hangs still on a thread yet hope
there is still if we can but stand unconquered for a little while
the others too now turned their eyes eastward over the sundering leagues of
land far away they gazed to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore their
thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow where now was
the ring-bearer how thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still hung it
seemed to legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught a glint of
white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessly remote and yet a present threat there was a tiny
tongue of flame
slowly théoden sat down again as if weariness still struggled to
master him against the will of gandalf he turned and looked at his great
house alas he said that these evil days should be mine and should come in
my old age instead of that peace which i have earned alas for boromir the
brave the young perish and the old linger withering he clutched his knees
with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped a
sword-hilt said gandalf
théoden rose and put his hand to his side but no sword hung at his
belt where has gríma stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear voice it was ever at your service
two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top
éomer was there no helm was on his head no mail was on his breast
but in his hand he held a drawn sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to
his master
how comes this said théoden sternly he turned towards éomer
and the men looked in wonder at him standing now proud and erect where was the
old man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his
stick
it is my doing lord said háma trembling i understood that
éomer was to be set free such joy was in my heart that maybe i have
erred yet since he was free again and he a marshal of the mark
brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my lord said éomer
for a moment of silence théoden stood looking down at éomer as
he knelt still before him neither moved
will you not take the sword said gandalf
slowly théoden stretched forth his hand as his fingers took
the hilt it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his
thin arm suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in
the air then he gave a great cry his voice rang clear as he chanted in the
tongue of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riders of théoden

dire deeds awake dark is it eastward

let horse be bridled horn be sounded
forth eorlingas
the guards thinking that they were summoned sprang up the stair they
looked at their lord in amazement and then as one man they drew their swords
and laid them at his feet command us they said
westu théoden hál
cried éomer it is a joy to us to see you return into your own never
again shall it be said gandalf that you come only with grief
take back your sword éomer sister-son said the king go háma
and seek my own sword gríma has it in his keeping bring him to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to give if i would hear it what is
your counsel
you have yourself already taken it answered gandalf to put your trust in
éomer rather than in a man of crooked mind to cast aside regret and
fear to do the deed at hand every man that can ride should be sent west at
once as éomer counselled you: we must first destroy the threat of
saruman while we have time if we fail we fall if we succeed - then we will
face the next task meanwhile your people that are left the women and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that you have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this let them take
provision but delay not nor burden themselves with treasures great or small
it is their lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good to me now said théoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests-truly you said gandalf that the
courtesy of my hall is lessened you have ridden through the night and the
morning wears away you have had neither sleep nor food a guest-house shall be
made ready: there you shall sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn there is no rest yet for the weary the men of
rohan must ride forth today and we will ride with them axe sword and bow we
did not bring them to rest against your wall lord
of the mark and i promised éomer that my sword and his should be drawn
together
now indeed there is hope of victory said éomer
hope yes said gandalf but isengard is strong and other perils draw
ever nearer do not delay théoden when we are gone lead your
people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in the hills
nay gandalf said the king you do not know your own skill in healing it
shall not be so i myself will go to war to fall in the front of the battle if
it must be thus shall i sleep better
then even the defeat of rohan will be glorious in song said aragorn the
armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying: the lord of the mark
will ride forth eorlingas
but your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i will take thought for that ere i go answered théoden here comes
my counsellor
at that moment háma came again from the hall behind him cringing
between two other men came gríma the wormtongue his face was very
white his eyes blinked in the sunlight háma knelt and presented to théoden
a long sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems here
lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said it was found in his
chest loth was he to render up the keys many other things are there which men
have missed
you lie said wormtongue and this sword your master himself gave into my
keeping
and he now requires it of you again said théoden does that
displease you
assuredly not lord said wormtongue i care for you and yours as best i
may but do not weary yourself or tax too heavily your strength let others
deal with these irksome guests your meat is about to be set on the board will
you not go to it
i will said théoden and let food for my guests be set on the
board beside me the host rides today send the heralds forth let them summon
all who dwell nigh every man and strong lad able to bear arms all who have
horses let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour
from noon
dear lord cried wormtongue it is as i feared this wizard has bewitched
you are none to be left to defend the golden hall of your fathers and all your
treasure none to guard the lord of the mark
if this is bewitchment said théoden it seems to me more wholesome
than your whisperings your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on all
fours like a beast no not one shall be left not even gríma gríma
shall ride too go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lord whined wormtongue grovelling on the ground have pity on one
worn out in your service send me not from your side i at least will stand by
you when all others have gone do not send your
faithful gríma away
you have my pity said théoden and i do not send you from my side
i go myself to war with my men i bid you come with me and prove your faith
wormtongue looked from face to face in his eyes was the hunted look of a
beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies he licked his lips with a
long pale tongue such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the house of
eorl old though he be he said but those who truly love him would spare his
failing years yet i see that i come too late others whom the death of my lord
would perhaps grieve less have already persuaded him if i cannot undo their
work hear me at least in this lord one who knows your mind and honours your
commands should be left in edoras appoint a faithful
steward let your counsellor gríma keep all things till your return-and i
pray that we may see it though no wise man will deem it hopeful
éomer laughed and if that plea does not excuse you from war most
noble wormtongue he said what office of less honour would you accept
to carry a sack of meal up into the mountains-if any man would trust you with
it
nay éomer you do not fully understand the mind of master
wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing glance upon him he is bold and
cunning even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw hours of my
precious time he has wasted already down snake he said suddenly in a
terrible voice down on your belly how long is it since saruman bought you
what was the promised price when all the men were dead you were to pick your
share of the treasure and take the woman you desire too long have you watched
her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
éomer grasped his sword that i knew already he muttered for that
reason i would have slain him before forgetting the law of the hall but
there are other reasons he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him with his
hand
éowyn is safe now he said but you wormtongue you have done what
you could for your true master some reward you have earned at least yet
saruman is apt to overlook his bargains i should advise you to go quickly and
remind him lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips said gandalf
i do not lie see théoden here is a snake with safety you cannot take
it with you nor can you leave it behind to slay it would be just but it was
not always as it now is once it was a man and did you service in its fashion
give him a horse and let him go at once wherever he chooses by his
choice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue said théoden this is your choice: to
ride with me to war and let us see in battle whether you are true or to go
now whither you will but then if ever we meet again i shall not be
merciful
slowly wormtongue rose he looked at them with half-closed eyes last of all
he scanned théodens face and opened his mouth as if to speak then
suddenly he drew himself up his hands worked his eyes glittered such
malice was in them that men stepped back from him he bared his teeth and then
with a hissing breath he spat before the kings feet and darting to one side
he fled down the stair
after him said théoden see that he does no harm to any
but do not hurt him or hinder him give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said éomer
one of the guards ran down the stair another went to the well at the foot of
the terrace and in his helm drew water with it he washed clean the stones that
wormtongue had defiled
now my guests come said théoden come and take such refreshment
as haste allows
they passed back into the great house already they heard below them in the
town the heralds crying and the war-horns blowing for the king was to ride
forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and
assembled
at the kings board sat éomer and the four guests and there also
waiting upon the king was the lady éowyn they ate and drank swiftly the
others were silent while théoden questioned gandalf concerning saruman
how far back his treachery goes who can guess said gandalf he was not
always evil once i do not doubt that he was the friend of rohan and even when
his heart grew colder he found you useful still but for long now he has
plotted your ruin wearing the mask of friendship until he was ready in those
years wormtongues task was easy and all that you did was swiftly known in
isengard for your land was open and strangers came and went and ever
wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your thought chilling your
heart weakening your limbs while others watched and could do nothing for your
will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the mask was torn for those who
would see after that wormtongue played dangerously always seeking to delay
you to prevent your full strength being gathered he was crafty: dulling mens
wariness or working on their fears as served the occasion do you not remember
how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on a wildgoose chase
northward when the immediate peril was westward he persuaded you to forbid
éomer to pursue the raiding orcs if éomer had not defied
wormtongues voice speaking with your mouth those orcs would have
reached isengard by now bearing a great prize not indeed that prize which
saruman desires above all else but at the least two members of my company
sharers of a secret hope of which even to you lord i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think of what they might now be suffering or what saruman might now
have learned to our destruction
i owe much to éomer said théoden faithful heart may have
forward tongue say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth may wear
a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said théoden most of all i owe
to you my guest once again you have come in time i would give you a gift ere
we go at your own choosing you have only to name aught that is mine i reserve
now only my sword
whether i came in time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf but as for
your gift lord i will choose one that will fit my need: swift and sure give
me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it but now shall
ride him into great hazard setting silver against black: i would not risk
anything that is not my own and already there is a bond of love between us
you choose well said théoden and i give him now gladly yet it is
a great gift there is none like to shadowfax in him one of the mighty
steeds of old has returned none such shall return again and to you my other
guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armoury swords you do not
need but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers
out of gondor choose from these ere we go and may they serve you well
now men came bearing raiment of war from the kings hoard and they arrayed
aragorn and legolas in shining mail helms too they chose and round shields:
their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems green and red and white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed no coat of rings even if one had been
found to match his stature for there was no hauberk in the hoards of edoras of
better make than his short corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north but
he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head and a
small shield he also took it bore the running horse white upon green that was
the emblem of the house of eorl
may it keep you well said théoden it
was made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
gimli bowed i am proud lord of the mark to bear your device he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
it may well be so said théoden
the king now rose and at once éowyn came forward bearing wine ferthu
théoden hál she said receive now this cup and drink
in happy hour health be with thee at thy going and coming
théoden drank from the cup and she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him and her
eyes were shining and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled but as he
took the cup his hand met hers and he knew that she trembled at the
touch hail aragorn son of arathorn she said hail lady of rohan he
answered but his face now was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors there the
guards awaited him and heralds stood and all the lords and chiefs were
gathered together that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be my last riding said théoden
i have no child théodred my son is slain i name éomer my
sister-son to be my heir if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you
will but to some one i must now entrust my people that i leave behind to rule
them in my place which of you will stay
no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do my people trust
in the house of eorl answered háma
but éomer i cannot spare nor would he stay said the king and he
is the last of that house
i said not éomer answered háma and he is not the last
there is éowyn daughter of éomund his sister she is fearless
and high-hearted all love her let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we
are gone
it shall be so said théoden let the heralds announce to the folk
that the lady éowyn will lead them
then the king sat upon a seat before his doors
and éowyn knelt before him and received from him a sword and a fair
corslet farewell sister-daughter he said dark is the hour yet maybe we
shall return to the golden hall but in dunharrow the people may long defend
themselves and if the battle go ill thither will come all who escape speak
not so she answered a year shall i endure for every day that passes until
your return but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said fear not not west but east does our
doom await us
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him the others
followed aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate alone éowyn
stood before the doors of the house at the stairs head the sword was
set upright before her and her hands were laid upon the hilt she was clad now
in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimli walked with legolas his axe on his shoulder well at last we set
off he said men need many words before deeds my axe is restless in my
hands though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to
it nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me how shall i come to the
battle i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i guess said legolas yet doubtless gandalf will
gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself an axe
is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman it is orc-necks i would hew not shave the
scalps of men said gimli patting the haft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men old and young all ready in the
saddle more than a thousand were there mustered their spears were like a
springing wood loudly and joyously they shouted as
théoden came forth some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane
and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas gimli stood ill at ease
frowning but éomer came up to him leading his horse
hail gimli glóins son he cried i have not had time to
learn gentle speech under your rod as you promised but shall we not put aside
our quarrel at least i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i will forget my wrath for a while éomer son of éomund said
gimli but if ever you chance to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then
you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendship will end
so be it said éomer but until that time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride with me i beg gandalf will be at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased i will gladly go with you
if legolas my comrade may ride beside us
it shall he so said éomer legolas
upon my left and aragorn upon my right and none will dare to stand before us
where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horses name and far away he tossed
his head and neighed and turning sped towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible even so would it
appear said éomer as the great horse ran
up until he stood before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said théoden but hearken all
here now i name my guest gandalf greyhame wisest of counsellors most welcome
of wanderers a lord of the mark a chieftain of the eorlingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you théoden king said gandalf then suddenly he threw back
his grey cloak and cast aside his hat and leaped to horseback he wore no helm
nor mail his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white robes shone dazzling
in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted forth eorlingas
the trumpets sounded the horses reared and
neighed spear clashed on shield then the king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of rohan rode thundering
into the west far over the plain éowyn saw the glitter of their spears
as she stood still alone before the doors of the silent house
 
the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras and the light of it
was in their eyes turning all the rolling fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way north-westward along the foot-hills of the white
mountains and this they followed up and down in a green country crossing
small swift streams by many fords far ahead and to their right the misty
mountains loomed ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by the sun
went slowly down before them evening came behind
the host rode on need drove them fearing to come too late they rode with
all the speed they could pausing seldom swift and enduring were the steeds of
rohan but there were many leagues to go forty leagues and more it was as a
bird flies from edoras to the fords of the isen where they hoped to find the
kings men that held back the hosts of saruman
night closed about them at last they halted to make their camp they had
ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain yet more
than half their journey lay still before them in a great circle under the
starry sky and the waxing moon they now made their bivouac they lit no fires
for they were uncertain of events but they set a ring of mounted guards about
them and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in the folds of the
land the slow night passed without tidings or alarm at dawn the horns sounded
and within an hour they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was in the air it was hot
for the season of the year the rising sun was hazy and behind it following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness as of a great storm moving out
of the east and away in the north-west there seemed to be another darkness
brooding about the feet of the misty mountains a shadow that crept down slowly
from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside éomer you have the
keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas he said and they can tell a
sparrow from a finch a league off tell me can you sec anything away yonder
towards isengard
many miles lie between said legolas gazing thither and shading his eyes
with his long hand i can see a darkness there are shapes moving in it great
shapes far away upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell it
is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a veiling shadow that some
power lays upon the land and it marches slowly down stream it is as if the
twilight under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills
and behind us comes a very storm of mordor said gandalf it will be a
black night
as the second day of their riding drew on the heaviness in the air
increased in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre
canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light the sun went
down blood-red in a smoking haze the spears of the riders were tipped with
fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of
thrihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the white
mountains three jagged horns staring at the sunset in the last red glow men in
the vanguard saw a black speck a horseman riding back towards them they halted
awaiting him
he came a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield slowly he climbed
from his horse and stood there a while gasping at length he spoke is éomer
here he asked you come at last but too late and with too little strength
things have gone evilly since théodred fell we were driven back
yesterday over the isen with great loss many perished at the crossing then at
night fresh forces came over the river against our camp all isengard must be
emptied and saruman has armed the wild hillmen and herd-folk of dunland
beyond the rivers and these also he loosed upon us we were overmastered the
shield-wall was broken erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gather towards his fastness in helms deep the rest are scattered
where is éomer tell him there is no hope ahead he should return to
edoras before the wolves of isengard come there théoden had sat silent
hidden from the mans sight behind his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he said i am here the last host of the
eorlingas has ridden forth it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder he drew himself up then he
knelt offering his notched sword to the king command me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought-
you thought i remained in meduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war but a west wind has shaken the boughs said théoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride to the help of erkenbrand
while théoden was speaking gandalf rode a short way ahead and he sat
there alone gazing north to isengard and west to the setting sun now he came
back
ride théoden he said ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in the plain i must leave you for a while shadowfax
must bear me now on a swift errand turning to aragorn and éomer and the
men of the kings household he cried: keep well the lord of the mark till i
return await me at helms gate farewell
he spoke a word to shadowfax and like an arrow from the bow the great horse
sprang away even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the sunset a
wind over the grass a shadow that fled and passed from sight snowmane snorted
and reared eager to follow but only a swift bird on the wing could have
overtaken him
what does that mean said one of the guard to háma
that gandalf greyhame has need of haste answered háma ever he
goes and comes unlooked-for:
wormtongue were he here would not find it hard to explain said the other
true enough said háma but for myself i will wait until i see
gandalf again
maybe you will wait long said the other
the host turned away now from the road to the fords of isen and bent their
course southward night fell and still they rode on the hills drew near but
the tall peaks of thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening sky still
some miles away on the far side of the westfold vale lay a green coomb a
great bay in the mountains out of which a gorge opened in the hills men of
that land called it helms deep after a hero of old wars who had made his
refuge there ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under the
shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow-haunted cliffs rose like mighty towers on
either side shutting out the light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there was a heel of rock thrust
outward by the northern cliff there upon its spur stood high walls of ancient
stone and within them was a lofty tower men said that in the far-off days of
the glory of gondor the sea-kings had built here this fastness with the hands of
giants the hornburg it was called for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed
in the deep behind as if armies long-forgotten were issuing to war from caves
beneath the hills a wall too the men of old had made from the hornburg to the
southern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge beneath it by a wide culvert
the deeping-stream passed out about the feet of the hornrock it wound and
flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore sloping gently
down from helms gate to helms dike thence it fell into the deeping-coomb and
out into the westfold vale there in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand
master of westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt as the days darkened
with threat of war being wise he had repaired the wall and made the fastness
strong
the riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the coomb when
cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front out of the
darkness arrows whistled swiftly a scout rode back and reported that
wolf-riders were abroad in the valley and that a host of orcs and wild men were
hurrying southward from the fords of isen and seemed to be making for helms
deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither said the
scout and we have met scattered companies going this way and that
leaderless what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know it is likely that
he will be overtaken ere he can reach helms gate if he has not already
perished
has aught been seen of gandalf asked théoden
yes lord many have seen an old man in white upon a horse passing hither
and thither over the plains like wind in the grass some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nightfall towards isengard some say also that
wormtongue was seen earlier going northward with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him
said théoden nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors the old and
the new but in this need we have no better choice than to go on as gandalf
said to helms gate whether erkenbrand be there or no is it known how great
is the host that comes from the north
it is very great said the scout he that flies counts every foeman twice
yet i have spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that the main strength
of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said éomer let
us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness there are
caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie hid and secret ways lead thence up
on to the hills
trust not to secret ways said the king saruman has long spied out this
land still in that place our defence may last long let us go
aragorn and legolas went now with éomer in the van on through the
dark night they rode ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed
southward higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains
feet they found few of the enemy before them here and there they came upon
roving bands of orcs but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it will not be long i fear said éomer ere the coming of
the kings host will be known to the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever
captain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew behind them now they could hear borne over the dark
the sound of harsh singing they had climbed far up into the deeping-coomb when
they looked back then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon the
black fields behind scattered like red flowers or winding up from the lowlands
in long flickering lines here and there a larger blaze leapt up
it is a great host and follows us hard said aragorn
they bring fire said théoden and they are burning as they come
rick cot and tree this was a rich vale and had many homesteads alas for my
folk
would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of
the mountains said aragorn it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further said éomer not far ahead now lies
helms dike an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs
below helms gate there we can turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend the dike said théoden it is a mile
long or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if we are pressed said éomer
there was neither star nor moon when the riders came to the breach in the
dike where the stream from above passed out and the road beside it ran down
from the hornburg the rampart loomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond
a dark pit as they rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate
éomer answered i éomer son of éomund speak
this is good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel hasten the enemy is
on your heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left many men to hold helms
gate and more had since escaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot said gamling an old man
the leader of those that watched the dike but most of them have seen too many
winters as i have or too few as my sons son here what news of erkenbrand
word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all that is left of the
best riders of westfold but he has not come
i fear that he will not come now said
éomer our scouts have gained no news of him and the enemy fills all
the valley behind us
i would that he had escaped said théoden he was a mighty man in
him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhand but we cannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls are you well stored we bring
little provision for we rode forth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are three parts of the folk of westfold
old and young children and women said gamling but great store of food and
many beasts and their fodder have also been gathered there
that is well said éomer they are burning or despoiling all that
is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for our goods at helms gate they will pay a high
price said gamling
the king and his riders passed on before the causeway that crossed the
stream they dismounted in a long file they led their horses up the ramp and
passed within the gates of the hornburg there they were welcomed again with joy
and renewed hope for now there were men enough to man both the burg and the
barrier wall
quickly éomer set his men in readiness the king and the men of his
household were in the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold-men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind it éomer arrayed most
of the strength that he had for here the defence seemed more doubtful if the
assault were determined and in great force the horses were led far up the deep
under such guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick that four men could walk
abreast along the top sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could
look here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the
outer court of the hornburg three flights of steps led also up on to the wall
from the deep behind but in front it was smooth and the great stones of it
were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints and at
the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall legolas sat above
on the parapet fingering his bow and peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stamping on the stones ever my
heart rises as we draw near the mountains there is good rock here this country
has tough bones i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike give me a
year and a hundred of my kin and i would make this a place that armies would
break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas but you are a dwarf and dwarves are
strange folk i do not like this place and i shall like it no more by the light
of day but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to have you standing nigh with
your stout legs and your hard axe i wish there were more of your kin among us
but even more would i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwood we shall need
them the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there are too few
here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli indeed it is time for sleep sleep i
feel the need of it as never i thought any dwarf could riding is tiring work
yet my axe is restless in my hand give me a row of orc-necks and room to swing
and all weariness will fall from me
a slow time passed far down in the valley scattered fires still burned the
hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now their torches could be seen
winding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screams and the fierce battle-cries of men
broke out flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the
breach then they scattered and vanished men came galloping back over the field
and up the ramp to the gate of the hornburg the rearguard of the westfolders
had been driven in
the enemy is at hand they said we loosed every arrow that we had and
filled the dike with orcs but it will not halt them long already they are
scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants but we have taught them
not to carry torches
it was now past midnight the sky was utterly dark and the stillness of the
heavy air foreboded storm suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills for a staring moment the
watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and the dike lit with white
light: it was boiling and crawling with black shapes some squat and broad some
tall and grim with high helms and sable shields hundreds and hundreds more
were pouring over the dike and through the breach the dark tide flowed up to
the walls from cliff to cliff thunder rolled in the valley rain came lashing
down
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements and fell
clinking and glancing on the stones some found a mark the assault on helms
deep had begun but no sound or challenge was heard within no answering arrows
came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness then the orcs screamed
waving spear and sword and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood
revealed upon the battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked out as it
seemed to them upon a great field of dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
brazen trumpets sounded the enemy surged forward some against the deeping
wall other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg-gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunland fells a
moment they hesitated and then on they came the lightning flashed and blazoned
upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of isengard was seen: they reached
the summit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them and a hail of
stones they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again broke and
charged again and each time like the incoming sea they halted at a higher
point again trumpets rang and a press of roaring men leaped forth they held
their great shields above them like a roof while in their midst they bore two
trunks of mighty trees behind them orc-archers crowded sending a hail of darts
against the bowmen on the walls they gained the gates the trees swung by
strong arms smote the timbers with a rending boom if any man fell crushed by
a stone hurtling from above two others sprang to take his place again and
again the great rams swung and crashed
éomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall they
heard the roar of voices and the thudding of the rams and then in a sudden
flash of light they beheld the peril of the gates
come said aragorn this is the hour when we draw swords together
running like fire they sped along the wall and up the steps and passed
into the outer court upon the rock as they ran they gathered a handful of stout
swordsmen there was a small postern-door that opened in an angle of the
burg-wall on the west where the cliff stretched
out to meet it on that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate
between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock together éomer and
aragorn sprang through the door their men close behind the swords flashed from
the sheath as one
gúthwinë cried éomer gúthwinë for the
mark
andúril cried aragorn andúril for the dúnedain
charging from the side they hurled themselves upon the wild men andúril
rose and fell gleaming with white fire a shout went up from wall and tower:
andúril andúril goes to war the blade that was broken shines
again
dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight but the wall of
their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke and they were swept away
hewn down or cast over the rock into the stony stream below the orc-archers
shot wildly and then fled
for a moment éomer and aragorn halted before the gates the thunder
was rumbling in the distance now the lightning flickered still far off among
the mountains in the south a keen wind was blowing from the north again
the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeped out and above the hills of
the coomb-side the westering moon rode glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates their great
hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them said éomer
look he pointed to the causeway already a great press of orcs and men were
gathering again beyond the stream arrows whined and skipped on the stones
about them come we must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and
beam across the gates within come now
they turned and ran at that moment some dozen orcs that had
lain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet and came silently and
swiftly behind two flung themselves to the ground at éomers heels
tripped him and in a moment they were on top of him but a small dark figure
that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout:
baruk khazâd khazâd ai-mênu an axe swung and
swept back two orcs fell headless the rest fled
éomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones when all were safe within éomer turned: i
thank you gimli son of glóin he said i did not know that you were
with us in the sortie but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company how
came you there
i followed you to shake off sleep said gimli but i looked on the hillmen
and they seemed over large for me so i sat beside a stone to see your
sword-play
i shall not find it easy to repay you said éomer
there may be many a chance ere the night is over laughed the dwarf but i
am content till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe he had returned to his place on the wall
two said legolas i have done better though now i must grope for spent
arrows all mine are gone yet i make my tale twenty at the least but that is
only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark the enemy before
them seemed to have grown rather than diminished still more were pressing up
from the valley through the breach the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief
respite the assault on the gates was redoubled against the deeping wall the
hosts of isengard roared like a sea orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet
from end to end ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling them back hundreds of long ladders were lifted
up many were cast down in ruin but many more replaced them and orcs sprang up
them like apes in the dark forests of the south before the walls foot the dead
and broken were piled like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary all their arrows
were spent and every shaft was shot their swords were notched and their
shields were riven three times aragorn and éomer rallied them and three
times andúril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind orcs had crept like rats through the
culvert through which the stream flowed out there they had gathered in the
shadow of the cliffs until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men
of the defence had rushed to the walls top then they sprang out already some
had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses fighting with
the guards
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs
khazâd khazâd he soon had work enough
ai-oi he shouted the orcs are behind the wall ai-oi come legolas
there are enough for us both khazâd ai-mênu
gamling the old looked down from the hornburg hearing the great voice of the
dwarf above all the tumult the orcs are in the deep he cried helm helm
forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped down the stair from the rock with many
men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them ere
long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge and all were slain or
driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the
hidden caves
twenty-one cried gimli he hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last orc
before his feet now my count passes master legolas again
we must stop this rat-hole said gamling dwarves are said to be cunning
folk with stone lend us your aid master
we do not shape stone with battle-axes nor with our finger-nails said
gimli but i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to
hand and under gimlis direction the westfold-men blocked up the inner end of
the culvert until only a narrow outlet remained then the deeping-stream
swollen by the rain churned and fretted in its choked path and spread slowly
in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above said gimli come gamling let us see how things
go on the wall
he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and éomer the elf was
whetting his long knife there was for a while a lull in the assault
since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
twenty-one said gimli
good said legolas but my count is now two dozen it has been knife-work
up here
éomer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords away on the
left the crash and clamour of the battle on the rock rose loud again but the
hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea its gates lay in ruin but
over the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon now sloping behind the
western hills that enclosed the valley this is a night as long as years he
said how long will the day tarry
dawn is not far off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him but
dawn will not help us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men said aragorn
but these creatures of isengard these half-orcs and goblin-men that the
foul craft of saruman has bred they will not quail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills do you not hear their voices
i hear them said éomer but they are only the scream of birds and
the bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling i know
that tongue it is an ancient speech of men and once was spoken in many western
valleys of the mark hark they hate us and they are glad for our doom seems
certain to them the king the king they cry we will take their king death
to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to the robbers of the north
such names they have for us not in half a thousand years have they forgotten
their grievance that the lords of gondor gave the mark to eorl the young and
made alliance with him that old hatred saruman has
inflamed they are fierce folk when roused they will not give way now for dusk
or dawn until théoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn is it not said that
no foe has ever taken the hornburg if men defended it
so the minstrels say said éomer
then let us defend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets then there was a crash and
a flash of flame and smoke the waters of the deeping-stream poured out hissing
and foaming: they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn they have crept in the culvert again
while we talked and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet elendil
elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the breach but even as he did
so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements over the wall and
under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of
sand the defence was swept away some of the riders were driven back further
and further into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way step by step
towards the caves others cut their way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to
the rock and the rear-gate of the hornburg near the bottom stood aragorn in
his hand still andúril gleamed and the terror of the sword for a while
held back the enemy as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up
towards the gate behind on the upper steps knelt legolas his bow was bent but
one gleaned arrow was all that he had left and he peered out now ready to
shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair
all who can have now got safe within aragorn he called come back
aragorn turned and sped up the stair but as he ran he stumbled in his
weariness at once his enemies leapt forward up came the orcs yelling with
their long arms stretched out to seize him the foremost fell with legolas last
arrow in his throat but the rest sprang over him then a great boulder cast
from the outer wall above crashed down upon the stair and hurled them back
into the deep aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
things go ill my friends he said wiping the sweat from his brow with his
arm
ill enough said legolas but not yet hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli
i do not know said aragorn i last saw him fighting on the ground behind
the wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evil news said legolas
he is stout and strong said aragorn let us hope that he will escape back
to the caves there he would be safe for a while safer than we such a refuge
would be to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas but i wish that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine
if he wins back to the caves he will pass your count again laughed
aragorn never did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and seek some arrows said legolas would that this night would
end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passed into the citadel there to his dismay he learned that
éomer had not reached the hornburg
nay he did not come to the rock said one of the westfold-men i last saw
him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep gamling was
with him and the dwarf but i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted to a high chamber in
the tower there stood the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon
the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken lord and all the defence swept away but many
have escaped hither to the rock
is éomer here
no lord but many of your men retreated into the deep and some say that
éomer was amongst them in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and
come within the caves what hope they may have then i do not know
more than we good provision it is said and the air is wholesome there
because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above none can force an
entrance against determined men they may hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn they have
a blasting fire and with it they took the wall if they cannot come in the
caves they may seal up those that are inside but now we must turn all our
thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prison said théoden if i could have set a spear
in rest riding before my men upon the field maybe i could have felt again the
joy of battle and so ended but i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the mark said
aragorn more hope we have to defend you in the hornburg than in edoras or
even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen to assault said théoden
but now my heart is doubtful the world changes and all that once was strong
now proves unsure how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such
reckless hate had i known that the strength of isengard was grown so great
maybe l should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of
gandalf his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king but i will not end here taken
like an old badger in a trap snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard
are in the inner court when dawn comes i will bid men sound helms horn and i
will ride forth will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe we shall
cleave a road or make such an end as will be worth a song-if any be left to
sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed round all their
circuit enheartening the men and lending aid wherever the assault was hot
legolas went with him blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones
grappling-hooks were hurled and ladders raised again and again the orcs gained
the summit of the outer wall and again the defenders cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of the darts of the
enemy as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale then he raised his
empty hand palm outward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jeered come down come down they cried if you wish
to speak to us come down bring out your king we are the fighting uruk-hai we
will fetch him from his hole if he does not come bring out your skulking
king
the king stays or comes at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing here they answered why do you look out do you
wish to see the greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk-hai
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeered we are the uruk-hai: we do not stop the
fight for night or day for fair weather or for storm we come to kill by sun
or moon what of the dawn
none knows what the new day shall bring him said aragorn get you gone
ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried this is no
parley you have nothing to say
i have still this to say answered aragorn no enemy has yet taken the
hornburg depart or not one of you will be spared not one will be left alive
to take back tidings to the north you do not know your peril
so great a power and royalty was revealed in aragorn as he stood there alone
above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies that many of the wild men
paused and looked back over their shoulders to the valley and some looked up
doubtfully at the sky but the orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail of
darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire the archway of the gate above which he
had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust the barricade
was scattered as if by a thunderbolt aragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about it yelled preparing to charge
a murmur arose behind them like a wind in the distance and it grew to a
clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn the orcs upon the rock
hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back and then sudden and
terrible from the tower above the sound of the great horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled many of the orcs cast themselves on their
faces and covered their ears with their claws back from the deep the echoes
came blast upon blast as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood but
on the walls men looked up listening with wonder for the echoes did not die
ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills nearer now and louder they
answered one to another blowing fierce and free
helm helm the riders shouted helm is arisen and comes back to war helm
for théoden king
and with that shout the king came his horse was white as snow golden was
his shield and his spear was long at his right hand was aragorn elendils
heir behind him rode the lords of the house of eorl the young light sprang in
the sky night departed
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great noise they charged down from the
gates they roared over the causeway they swept and they drove through the
hosts of isengard as a wind among grass behind them from the deep came the
stern cries of men issuing from the caves driving forth the enemy out poured
all the men that were left upon the rock and ever the sound of blowing horns
echoed in the hills
on they rode the king and his companions captains and champions fell or
fled before them neither orc nor man withstood them their backs were to the
swords and spears of the riders and their faces to the valley they cried and
wailed for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the rising of the day
so king théoden rode from helms gate and clove his path to the great
dike there the company halted light grew bright about them shafts of
the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears but they
sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping-coomb
the land had changed where before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping the ever-mounting hills there now a forest loomed great trees bare
and silent stood rank on rank with tangled bough and hoary head their
twisted roots were buried in the long green grass darkness was under them
between the dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two open furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror of the king and in
terror of the trees they streamed down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb seeking to
escape upon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys side upon the left
from the west their final doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad in white shining in the
rising sun over the low hills the horns were sounding behind him hastening
down the long slopes were a thousand men on foot their swords were in their
hands amid them strode a man tall and strong his shield was red as he came to
the valleys brink he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing
blast
erkenbrand the riders shouted erkenbrand
behold the white rider cried aragorn gandalf is come again
mithrandir mithrandir said legolas this is wizardry indeed come i
would look on this forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and that turning from fear to
fear again the horn sounded from the tower down through the breach of the dike
charged the kings company down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of
westfold down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the
mountains the white rider was upon them and the terror of his coming filled
the enemy with madness the wild men fell on their faces before him the orcs
reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear like a black smoke
driven by a mounting wind they fled wailing they passed under the waiting
shadow of the trees and from that shadow none ever came again
 
so it was that in the light of a fair morning king théoden and gandalf
the white rider met again upon the green grass beside the deeping-stream there
was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the elf and erkenbrand of
westfold and the lords of the golden house about them were gathered the
rohirrim the riders of the mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory and
their eyes were turned towards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout and down from the dike came those who had
been driven back into the deep there came gamling
the old and éomer son of éomund and beside them walked gimli the
dwarf he had no helm and about his head was a linen band stained with blood
but his voice was loud and strong
forty-two master legolas he cried alas my axe is notched: the
forty-second had an iron collar on his neck how is it with you
you have passed my score by one answered legolas but i do not grudge you
the game so glad am i to see you on your legs
welcome éomer sister-son said théoden now that i see you
safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said éomer the dark night has passed and
day has come again but the day has brought strange tidings he turned and
gazed in wonder first at the wood and then at gandalf once more you
come in the hour of need unlooked-for he said
unlooked-for said gandalf i said that i would return and meet you here
but you did not name the hour nor foretell the manner of your coming
strange help you bring you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white
that may be but if so i have not shown it yet i have but given good
counsel in peril and made use of the speed of shadowfax your own valour has
done more and the stout legs of the westfold-men marching through the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder some glanced darkly
at the wood and passed their hands over their brows as if they thought their
eyes saw otherwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily the trees he said nay i see the wood
as plainly as do you but that is no deed of mine it is a thing beyond the
counsel of the wise better than my design and better even than my hope the
event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said théoden not sarumans
that is plain is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet to learn
it is not wizardry but a power far older said gandalf: a power that
walked the earth ere elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn

when young was mountain under moon

ere ring was made or wrought was woe

it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said théoden
if you would learn that you should come with me to isengard  answered
gandalf
to isengard they cried
yes said gandalf i shall return to isengard and those who will may come
with me there we may see strange things
but there are not men enough in the mark not if they were all gathered
together and healed of wounds and weariness to assault the
stronghold of saruman said théoden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf i shall not stay there long
my way lies now eastward look for me in edoras ere the waning of the moon
nay said théoden in the dark hour before dawn i doubted
but we will not part now i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as may be now said gandalf and
since he has done you great injury it would be fitting if you were there but
how soon and how swiftly will you ride
my men are weary with battle said the king and i am weary also for i
have ridden far and slept little alas my old age is not feigned nor due only
to the whisperings of wormtongue it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure
not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandalf we will
journey under the shadow of evening it is as well for it is my counsel that
all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be henceforth but do not
command many men to go with you théoden we
go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses and he sent
them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the mark and they
bore his summons also bidding all men young and
old to come in haste to edoras there the lord of the mark would hold an
assembly of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon to
ride with him to isengard the king chose éomer and twenty men of his
household with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas and gimli in
spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said it would take
more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorn
the king now returned to the hornburg and slept such a sleep of quiet as he
had not known for many years and the remainder of his chosen company rested
also but the others all that were not hurt or wounded began a great labour
for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted but a great many of the
hillmen had given themselves up and they were afraid and cried for mercy
the men of the mark took their weapons from them and set them to work
help now to repair the evil in which you have joined said erkenbrand and
afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of men and then you shall go free back to your
land for you have been deluded by saruman many of you have got death as the
reward of your trust in him but had you conquered little better would your
wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had told them that the men of
rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two mounds were raised and
beneath them were laid all the riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upon one side and those of
westfold upon the other in a_ grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg lay
háma captain of the kings guard he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the mounds of men not far from
the eaves of the forest and the people were troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning they had little wood
for firing and none would have dared to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great
peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart the work of burial
was then but beginning and théoden mourned for the loss of háma
his captain and cast the first earth upon his grave great injury
indeed has saruman done to me and all this land he said and i will remember
it when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the coomb when
at last théoden and gandalf and their companions rode down from
the dike behind them were gathered a great host both of the riders and of the
people of westfold old and young women and children who had come out from the
caves a song of victory they sang with clear voices and then they fell silent
wondering what would chance for their eyes were on the trees and they feared
them
the riders came to the wood and they halted horse and man they were
unwilling to pass in the trees were grey and menacing and a shadow or a mist
was about them the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like searching
fingers their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strange
monsters and dark caverns opened beneath them but gandalf went forward
leading the company and where the road from the hornburg met the trees they saw
now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs and through it gandalf
passed and they followed him then to their amazement they found that the road
ran on and the deeping-stream beside it and the sky was open above and full of
golden light but on either side the great aisles of the wood were already
wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows and there they heard
the creaking and groaning of boughs and far cries and a rumour of wordless
voices murmuring angrily no orc or other living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse and they kept
close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf i feel a great wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in your ears
yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in silence for a while but legolas was ever glancing from side to
side and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli
had allowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he said and i have seen
many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age i wish that there were leisure now
to walk among them: they have voices and in time i might come to understand
their thought
no no said gimli let us leave them i guess their thought already:
hatred of all that go on two legs and their speech is of crushing and
strangling
not of all that go on two legs said legolas there i think you are wrong
it is orcs that they hate for they do not belong here and know little of elves
and men far away are the valleys where they sprang from the deep dales of
fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
then that is the most perilous wood in middle-earth said gimli i should
be grateful for the part they have played but i do not love them you may think
them wonderful but i have seen a greater wonder in this land more beautiful
than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still full of ft strange
are the ways of men legolas here they have one of the marvels of the northern
world and what do they say of it caves they say caves holes to fly to in
time of war to store fodder in my good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms deep are vast and beautiful there would be an endless pilgrimage of
dwarves merely to gaze at them if such things were known to be aye indeed
they would pay pure gold for a brief glance
and i would give gold to be excused said legolas and double to be let
out if i strayed in
you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli but you speak like
a fool do you think those halls are fair where your king dwells under the hill
in mirkwood and dwarves helped in their making long ago they are but hovels
compared with the caverns i have seen here: immeasurable halls filled with an
everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as fair as
kheled-zâram in the starlight
and legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors
under the echoing domes ah then legolas gems and crystals and veins of
precious ore glint in the polished walls and the light glows through folded
marbles shell-like translucent as the living hands of queen galadriel there
are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose legolas fluted and twisted into
dreamlike forms they spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening
pendants of the roof: wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears
banners pinnacles of suspended palaces still lakes mirror them: a glimmering
world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities such as the
mind of durin could scarce have imagined in his sleep stretch on through
avenues and pillared courts on into the dark recesses where no light can come
and plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the
towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea then evening
comes: they fade and twinkle out the torches pass on into another chamber and
another dream there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome stair beyond stair and still the winding paths lead on
into the mountains heart caves the caverns of helms deep happy was the
chance that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your comfort gimli said the elf
that you may come safe from war and return to see them again but do not tell
all your kindred there seems little left for them to do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to say little: one family of busy dwarves
with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made
no you do not understand said gimli no dwarf could be unmoved by such
loveliness none of durins race would mine those caves for stones or ore not
if diamonds and gold could be got there do you cut down groves of blossoming
trees in the spring-time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering
stone not quarry them with cautious skill tap by tap - a small chip of rock
and no more perhaps in a whole anxious day - so we could work and as the
years went by we should open up new ways and display
far chambers that are still dark glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the
rock and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps as once shone in
khazad-dûm and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain
there since the hills were made and when we desired rest we would let
the night return
you move me gimli said legolas i have never heard you speak like this
before almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves come let us
make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey for a while together you shall visit fangorn with me and then i
will come with you to see helms deep
that would not be the way of return that i should choose said gimli but
i will endure fangorn if i have your promise to come back to the caves and
share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas but alas now we must leave behind both
cave and wood for a while: see we are coming to the end of the trees how far
is it to isengard gandalf
about fifteen leagues as the crows of saruman make it said gandalf: five
from the mouth of deeping-coomb to the fords: and ten more from there to the
gates of isengard but we shall not ride all the way this night
and when we come there what shall we see asked gimli you may know but
i cannot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard i was there at
nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since yet i think that you will
not say that the journey was in vain - not though the glittering caves of
aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the trees and found that they had come to
the bottom of the coomb where the road from helms deep branched going one way
east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen as they rode from
under the eaves of the wood legolas halted and looked back with regret then he
gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he said eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs
i never saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned but legolas started to
ride back
no no cried gimli do as you please in your madness but let me first
get down from this horse i wish to see no eyes stay legolas greenleaf
said gandalf do not go back into the wood not yet now is not your time
even as he spoke there came forward out of the trees three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were twelve feet or more in height their strong bodies
stout as young trees seemed to be clad with raiment or with hide of
close-fitting grey and brown their limbs were long and their hands had many
fingers their hair was stiff and their beards grey-green as moss they gazed
out with solemn eyes but they were not looking at the riders: their eyes were
bent northwards suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and sent
forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn but more musical and various the
calls were answered and turning again the riders saw other creatures of the
same kind approaching striding through the grass they came swiftly from the
north walking like wading herons in their gait but not in their speed for
their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the herons wings the riders
cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands upon their sword-hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf these are but herdsmen they are not
enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke the tall creatures without a glance at
the riders strode into the wood and vanished
herdsmen said théoden where are their flocks what are they
gandalf for it is plain that to you at any rate they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf is it so long since
you listened to tales by the fireside there are children in your land who out
of the twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your question you
have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn forest which in your tongue you call
the entwood did you think that the name was given only in idle fancy nay théoden
it is otherwise: to them you are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to théoden the old are of little count to them and all the
deeds of your house but a small matter
the king was silent ents he said at length out of the shadows of legend
i begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees i think i have lived to
see strange days long we have tended our beasts and our fields built our
houses wrought our tools or ridden away to help in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the world we cared little for
what lay beyond the borders of our land songs we have that tell of these
things but we are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a
careless custom and now the songs have come down among us out of strange
places and walk visible under the sun
you should be glad théoden king said gandalf for not only the
little life of men is now endangered but the life also of those things
which you have deemed the matter of legend you are not without allies even if
you know them not
yet also i should be sad said théoden for however the fortune of
war shall go may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for ever out of middle-earth
it may said gandalf the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been but to such days we are doomed let us now go on with the
journey we have begun
the company turned then away from the coomb and from the wood and took the
road towards the fords legolas followed reluctantly the sun had set already
it had sunk behind the rim of the world but as they rode out from the shadow of
the hills and looked west to the gap of rohan the sky was still red and a
burning light was under the floating clouds dark against it there wheeled and
flew many black-winged birds some passed overhead with mournful cries
returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion-fowl have been busy about the
battle-field said éomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing towards the full and in its cold silver light
the swelling grass-lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea they had ridden for
some four hours from the branching of the roads when they drew near to the
fords long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread in stony shoals
between high grassy terraces borne upon the wind they heard the howling of
wolves their hearts were heavy remembering the many men that had fallen in
battle in this place
the road dipped between rising turf-banks carving its way through the
terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side there were
three lines of flat stepping-stones across the stream and between them fords
for horses that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst the riders
looked down upon the crossings and it seemed strange to them for the fords had
ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water upon stones but now
they were silent the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare waste of
shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreary place said éomer what sickness has
befallen the river many fair things saruman has destroyed: has he
devoured the springs of isen too so it would seem said gandalf
alas said théoden must we pass this way where the carrion-beasts
devour so many good riders of the mark
this is our way said gandalf grievous is the fall of your men but you
shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them it is
with their friends the orcs that they hold their feast: such indeed is the
friendship of their kind come
they rode down to the river and as they came the wolves ceased their howling
and slunk away fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and shadowfax his
horse shining like silver the riders passed over to the islet and glittering
eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
look said gandalf friends have laboured here
and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled ringed with
stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell near this place said gandalf
here let them rest said éomer and
when their spears have rotted and rusted long still may their mound stand and
guard the fords of isen
is this your work also gandalf my friend said théoden you
accomplished much in an evening and a night
with the help of shadowfax - and others said gandalf i rode fast and
far but here beside the mound i will say this for your comfort: many fell in
the battles of the fords but fewer than rumour made them more were scattered
than were slain i gathered together all that i could find some men i sent with
grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand some i set to make this burial they
have now followed your marshal elfhelm i sent him with many riders to edoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against you and his servants
had turned aside from all other errands and gone to helms deep: the lands
seemed empty of enemies yet i feared that wolf-riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheless to meduseld while it was undefended but now i think you need not
fear: you will find your house to welcome your return
and glad shall i be to see it again said théoden though brief
now i doubt not shall be my abiding there
with that the company said farewell to the island and the mound and passed
over the river and climbed the further bank then they rode on glad to have
left the mournful fords as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew
there was an ancient highway that ran down from isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its course beside the river bending with it east and then
north but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of
isengard and these were under the mountain-side in the west of the valley
sixteen miles or more from its mouth this road they followed but they did not
ride upon it for the ground beside it was firm and level covered for many
miles about with short springing turf they rode now more swiftly and by
midnight the fords were nearly five leagues behind then they halted ending
their nights journey for the king was weary they were come to the feet of the
misty mountains and the long arms of nan curunír stretched down to meet
them dark lay the vale before them for the moon had passed into the west and
its light was hidden by the hills but out of the deep shadow of the dale
rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted it caught the rays of the
sinking moon and spread in shimmering billows black and silver over the
starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn one would say that all
the wizards vale was burning
there is ever a fume above that valley in these days said éomer:
but i have never seen aught like this before these are steams rather than
smokes saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us maybe he is boiling
all the waters of isen and that is why the river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing now
let us rest for a while if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a little but late in the night the watchmen cried out and
all awoke the moon was gone stars were shining above but over the ground
there crept a darkness blacker than the night on both sides of the river it
rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf draw no weapons wait and it will pass
you by
a mist gathered about them above them a few stars still glimmered faintly
but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom they were in a
narrow lane between moving towers of shadow voices they heard whisperings and
groanings and an endless rustling sigh the earth shook under them long it
seemed to them that they sat and were afraid but at last the darkness and the
rumour passed and vanished between the mountains arms
away south upon the hornburg in the middle night men heard a great noise as
a wind in the valley and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no one
ventured to go forth but in the morning they went out and were amazed for the
slain orcs were gone and the trees also far down into the valley of the deep
the grass was crushed and trampled brown as if giant herdsmen had pastured
great droves of cattle there but a mile below the dike a huge pit had been
delved in the earth and over it stones were piled into a hill men believed
that the orcs whom they had slain were buried there but whether those who had
fled into the wood were with them none could say for no man ever set foot upon
that hill the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow
there but the strange trees were never seen in deeping-coomb again they had
returned at night and had gone far away to the dark dales of fangorn thus they
were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that night but they saw and heard no
other strange thing save one: the voice of the river beside them suddenly
awoke there was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones and when it had
passed the isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on the light came grey and pale and they did
not see the rising of the sun the air above was heavy with fog and a reek lay
on the land about them they went slowly riding
now upon the highway it was broad and hard and well-tended dimly through the
mists they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left they
had passed into nan curunír the wizards vale that was a sheltered
valley open only to the south once it had been fair and green and
through it the isen flowed already deep and strong before it found the plains
for it was fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills
and all about it there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres
tilled by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley had become a wilderness
of weeds and thorns brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush
and bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed no trees grew there but
among the rank grasses could still be seen the burned and axe-hewn stumps of
ancient groves it was a sad country silent now but for the stony noise of
quick waters smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the
hollows the riders did not speak many doubted in their hearts wondering to
what dismal end their journey led
after they had ridden for some miles the highway became a wide street paved
with great flat stones squared and laid with skill no blade of grass was seen
in any joint deep gutters filled with trickling water ran down on either
side suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them it was black and set upon
it was a great stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long white hand
its finger pointed north not far now they knew that the gates of isengard must
stand and their hearts were heavy but their eyes could not pierce the mists
ahead
beneath the mountains arm within the wizards vale through years uncounted
had stood that ancient place that men called isengard partly it was shaped in
the making of the mountains but mighty works the men of westernesse had wrought
there of old and saruman had dwelt there long and had not been idle
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height accounted by many the
chief of wizards a great ring-wall of stone like towering cliffs stood out
from the shelter of the mountain-side from which it ran and then returned
again one entrance only was there made in it a great arch delved in the
southern wall here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn closed
at either end with mighty doors of iron they were so wrought and poised upon
their huge hinges posts of steel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly one
who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel beheld a plain a
great circle somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured
from rim to rim once it had been green and filled with avenues and groves of
fruitful trees watered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake but
no green thing grew there in the latter days of saruman the roads were paved
with stone-flags dark and hard and beside their borders instead of trees there
marched long lines of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
joined by heavy chains
many houses there were chambers halls and passages cut and tunnelled back
into the walls upon their inner side so that all the open circle was overlooked
by countless windows and dark doors thousands could dwell there workers
servants slaves and warriors with great store of arms wolves were fed and
stabled in deep dens beneath the plain too was bored and delved shafts were
driven deep into the ground their upper ends were covered by low mounds and
domes of stone so that in the moonlight the ring of isengard looked like a
graveyard of unquiet dead for the ground trembled the shafts ran down by many
slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries
store-houses armouries smithies and great furnaces iron wheels revolved
there endlessly and hammers thudded at night plumes of vapour steamed from the
vents lit from beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains there stood a tower of
marvellous shape it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed the ring
of isengard and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of men but riven
from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills a peak and isle
of rock it was black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone
were welded into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns their
pinnacles sharp as the points of spears keen-edged as knives between them was
a narrow space and there upon a floor of polished stone written with strange
signs a man might stand five hundred feet above the plain this was orthanc
the citadel of saruman the name of which had by design or chance a twofold
meaning for in the elvish speech orthanc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong place and wonderful was isengard and long it had been beautiful
and there great lords had dwelt the wardens of gondor upon the west and wise
men that watched the stars but saruman had slowly shaped it to his shifting
purposes and made it better as he thought being deceived-for all those arts
and subtle devices for which he forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he
imagined were his own came but from mordor so that what he made was naught
only a little copy a childs model or a slaves flattery of that vast
fortress armoury prison furnace of great power
barad-dûr the dark tower which suffered no rival and laughed at
flattery biding its time secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength
this was the stronghold of saruman as fame reported it for within living
memory the men of rohan had not passed its gates save perhaps a few such as
wormtongue who came in secret and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand and passed it: and as he
did so the riders saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white it
was stained as with dried blood and looking closer they perceived that its
nails were red unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they
followed him all about them now as if there had been a sudden flood wide
pools of water lay beside the road filling the hollows and rills went
trickling down among the stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they came and saw that
beyond him the mists had cleared and a pale sunlight shone the hour of noon
had passed they were come to the doors of isengard
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground and all about stone
cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards was scattered far and wide
or piled in ruinous heaps the great arch still stood but it opened now upon a
roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare and through the cliff-like walls on
either side great rents and breaches had been torn their towers were beaten
into dust if the great sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with
storm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron in which
there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars chests and casks and
broken gear twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the
flood but all the roads were drowned far off it seemed half veiled in
winding cloud there loomed the island rock still dark and tall unbroken by
the storm the tower of orthanc stood pale waters lapped about its feet
the king and all his company sat silent on their horses marvelling
perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown but how they could not
guess and now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubble-heap and suddenly they were
aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease grey-clad hardly to be
seen among the stones there were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside
them as if they had just eaten well and now rested from their labour one
seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms behind his head leaned
back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings
of thin blue smoke
for a moment théoden and éomer and all his men stared at them
in wonder amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest
sight but before the king could speak the small smoke-breathing figure became
suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist he
sprang to his feet a young man he looked or like one though not much more
than half a man in height his head of brown curling hair was uncovered but he
was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions
of gandalf had worn when they rode to edoras he
bowed very low putting his hand upon his breast then seeming not to observe
the wizard and his friends he turned to éomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said we are the doorwardens meriadoc
son of saradoc is my name and my companion who alas is overcome with
weariness - here he gave the other a dig with his foot - is peregrin son of
paladin of the house of took far in the north is our home the lord saruman is
within but at the moment he is closeted with one wormtongue or doubtless he
would be here to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf and was it saruman that ordered you
to guard his damaged doors and watch for the arrival of guests when your
attention could be spared from plate and bottle
no good sir the matter escaped him answered merry gravely he has been
much occupied our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management
of isengard he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words i
have done my best
and what about your companions what about legolas and me cried gimli
unable to contain himself longer you rascals you woolly-footed and wool-pated
truants a fine hunt you have led us two hundred leagues through fen and
forest battle and death to rescue you and here we find you feasting and
idling-and smoking smoking where did you come by the weed you villains
hammer and tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that if i do not burst it
will be a marvel
you speak for me gimli laughed legolas though i would sooner learn how
they came by the wine
one thing you have not found in your hunting and thats brighter wits
said pippin opening an eye here you find us sitting on a field of victory
amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned
comforts
well-earned said gimli i cannot believe that
the riders laughed it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear
friends said théoden so these are the lost ones of your
company gandalf the days are fated to be filled with marvels already i have
seen many since i left my house and now here before my eyes stand yet another
of the folk of legend are not these the halflings that some among us call the
holbytlan
hobbits if you please lord said pippin
hobbits said théoden your tongue is strangely changed but the
name sounds not unfitting so hobbits no report that i have heard does justice
to the truth
merry bowed and pippin got up and bowed low you are gracious lord or i
hope that i may so take your words he said and here is another marvel i
have wandered in many lands since i left my home and never till now have i
found people that knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out of the north long ago said
théoden but i will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits all
that is said among us is that far away over many hills and rivers live the
halfling folk that dwell in holes in sand-dunes but there are no legends of
their deeds for it is said that they do little and avoid the sight of men
being able to vanish in a twinkling: and they can change their voices to
resemble the piping of birds but it seems that more could be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said théoden i had not heard that they spouted
smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry for it is an art which we have not
practised for more than a few generations it was tobold hornblower of
longbottom in the southfarthing who first grew the true pipe-weed in his
gardens about the year 1070 according to our reckoning how old toby came by
the plant…
you do not know your danger théoden interrupted gandalf these
hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the
table or the small doings of their fathers grandfathers and
great-grandfathers and remoter cousins to the ninth degree if you encourage
them with undue patience some other time would be more fitting for the history
of smoking where is treebeard merry
away on the north side i believe he went to get a drink-of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy at their work - over there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and as they looked they heard a
distant rumbling and rattling as if an avalanche was falling from the
mountain-side far away came a hoom-hom as of horns blowing
triumphantly
and is orthanc then left unguarded asked gandalf
there is the water said merry but quickbeam and some others are watching
it not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there said legolas but his arms are at his
sides and he stands as still as a door-tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at any rate have not eaten since
early morning yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be did he leave me no
message or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind
he left a message said merry and i was coming to it but i have been
hindered by many other questions i was to say that if the lord of the mark and
gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find treebeard there and he
will welcome them i may add that they will also find food of the best there it
was discovered and selected by your humble servants he bowed
gandalf laughed that is better he said well théoden will you
ride with me to find treebeard we must go round about but it is not
far when you see treebeard you will learn much for treebeard is fangorn and
the eldest and chief of the ents and when you speak with him you will hear the
speech of the oldest of all living things
i will come with you said théoden farewell my hobbits
may we meet again in my house there you shall sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires as far as you can reckon
them and we will speak also of tobold the old and his herb-lore farewell
the hobbits bowed low so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an
undertone a fine old fellow very polite
 
gandalf and the kings company rode away turning eastward to make the
circuit of the ruined walls of isengard but aragorn gimli and legolas
remained behind leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass they came
and sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we meet again at last where none of us
ever thought to come said aragorn
and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters said
legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there are still many things that i
should like to know the truth of
and there is a great deal too that we want to know about you  said merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old ent but that is not
nearly enough
all in good time said legolas we were the hunters and you should give
an account of yourselves to us first
or second said gimli it would go better after a meal t have a sore
head and it is past mid-day you truants might make amends by finding us some
of the plunder that you spoke of food and drink would pay off some of my score
against you
then you shall have it said pippin will you have it here or in more
comfort in whats left of sarumans guard-house--over there under the arch we
had to picnic out here so as to keep an eye on the road
less than an eye said gimli but i will not go into any orc-house nor
touch orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry we have had enough of orcs ourselves
to last a life-time but there were many other folk in isengard saruman kept
enough wisdom not to trust his orcs he had men to guard his gates: some of his
most faithful servants i suppose anyway they were favoured and got good
provisions
and pipe-weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed but that is another story which can
wait until after lunch
well let us go and have lunch then said the dwarf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the arch and came to a wide
door upon the left at the top of a stair it opened direct into a large
chamber with other smaller doors at the far end and a hearth and chimney at
one side the chamber was hewn out of the stone and it must once have been
dark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel but light came in now
through the broken roof on the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin it cheered us up in the fogs there were
few faggots about and most of the wood we could find was wet but there is a
great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock and
fortunately it has not been blocked a fire is handy i will make you some
toast the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table
and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors store-room in
there and above the woods luckily said pippin as they came back laden with
dishes bowls cups knives and food of various sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the provender master gimli said
merry this is not orc-stuff but man-food as treebeard calls it will you
have wine or beer theres a barrel inside there - very passable and this is
first-rate salted pork or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them
if you like i am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather
interrupted in the last few days i cannot offer you anything to follow but
butter and honey for your bread are you content
indeed yes said gimli the score is much reduced
the three were soon busy with their meal and the two hobbits unabashed set
to a second time we must keep our guests company they said
you are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas but maybe if we
had not arrived you would already have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin we had foul fare with the orcs and
little enough for days before that it seems a long while since we could eat to
hearts content
it does not seem to have done you any harm said aragorn indeed you look
in the bloom of health
aye you do indeed said gimli looking them up and down over the top of
his cup why your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted and i
would swear that you have both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbits
of your age this treebeard at any rate has not starved you
he has not said merry but ents only drink and drink is not enough for
content treebeards draughts may be nourishing but one feels the need of
something solid and even lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have you said legolas ah then
i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him strange songs have
been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many strange tales have been told about that land said aragorn i have
never entered it come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents are - well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very odd he tried a few fumbling words that
trailed off into silence oh well he went on you have seen some at a
distance already-they saw you at any rate and reported that you were on the
way-and you will see many others i expect before you leave here you must form
your own ideas
now now said gimli we are beginning the story in the middle i should
like a tale in the right order starting with that strange day when our
fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry but first-if you have
finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up and then for a little
while we can pretend that we are all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco we have heaps of it he
said and you can all pack as much as you wish when we go we did some
salvage-work this morning pippin and i there are lots of things floating
about it was pippin who found two small barrels washed up out of some cellar
or store-house i suppose when we opened them we found they were filled with
this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it it feels good
and it smells good he said
it is good said merry my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were
the hornblower brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plain how it came here i
cant imagine for sarumans private use i fancy i never knew that it went so
far abroad but it comes in handy now
it would said gimli if i had a pipe to go with it alas i lost mine in
moria or before is there no pipe in all your plunder
no i am afraid not said merry we have not found any not even here in
the guardrooms saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems and i dont think
it would be any use knocking on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of him we
shall have to share pipes as good friends must at a pinch
half a moment said pippin putting his hand inside the breast of his
jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string i keep a treasure or two
near my skin as precious as rings to me heres one: my old wooden pipe and
heres another: an unused one i have carried it a long way though i dont
know why i never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey when my
own ran out but now it comes in useful after all he held up a small pipe with
a wide flattened bowl and handed it to gimli does that settle the score
between us he said settle it cried gimli most noble hobbit it leaves me
deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air to see what the wind and sky are
doing said legolas
we will come with you said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the mists were lifting and floating
away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said aragorn we will sit on
the edge of ruin and talk as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere i feel a
weariness such as i have seldom felt before he wrapped his grey cloak about
him hiding his mail-shirt and stretched out his long legs then he lay back
and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin strider the ranger has come back
he has never been away said aragorn i am
strider and dúnadan too and i belong both to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a while and the sun shone on them slanting into
the valley from among white clouds high in the west legolas lay still looking
up at the sun and sky with steady eyes and singing softly to himself at last
he sat up come now he said time wears on and the mists are blowing away
or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke what of the
tale
well my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all
strung-up in an orc-camp said pippin let me see what is today
the fifth of march in the shire-reckoning said aragorn pippin made some
calculations on his fingers only nine days ago he said1 it seems a year
since we were caught well though half of it was like a bad dream i reckon
that three very horrible days followed merry will correct me if i forget
anything important: i am not going into details: the whips and the filth and
stench and all that it does not bear remembering with that he plunged into an
account of boromirs last fight and the orc-march from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treasures that you let fall said aragorn you will be glad
to have them back he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it
the two sheathed knives
well said merry i never expected to see those again i marked a few orcs
with mine but uglúk took them from us how he glared at first i
thought he was going to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned
him
and here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn i have kept it safe
for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippin it was a wrench to let it go but what else could i
do
nothing else answered aragorn one who cannot cast away a treasure at
need is in fetters you did rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with both hands one might
say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas i wondered if you had grown
wings
unfortunately not said pippin but you did not know about grishnákh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to tell of those last horrible
moments: the pawing hands the hot breath and the dreadful strength of grishnákhs
hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad-dûr lugbúrz as they call it
makes me uneasy said aragorn the dark lord already knew too much and his
servants also and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river
after the quarrel the red eye will be looking towards isengard but saruman at
any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor said merry things began to
go all wrong for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villain or so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said aragorn
let me see said merry: five nights ago-now we come to a part of the story
you know nothing about we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that
night we were at wellinghall one of his ent-houses the next morning we went to
entmoot a gathering of ents that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen
in my life it lasted all that day and the next and we spent the nights with an
ent called quickbeam and then late in the afternoon in the third day of their
moot the ents suddenly blew up it was amazing the forest had felt as tense as
if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it: then all at once it exploded i wish
you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a hundred miles away by now even if he
had had to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bone

we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door
there was very much more a great deal of the song had no words and was like
a music of horns and drums it was very exciting but i thought it was only
marching music and no more just a song - until i got here i know better now
we came down over the last ridge into nan curunír after night
had fallen merry continued it was then that i first had the feeling that the
forest itself was moving behind us i thought i was dreaming an entish dream
but pippin had noticed it too we were both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in "short language"
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they are ents that have become
almost like trees at least to look at they stand here and there in the wood or
under its eaves silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep in the
darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them i believe
there is a great power in them and they seem able to wrap themselves in
shadow: it is difficult to see them moving but they do they can move very
quickly if they are angry you stand still looking at the weather maybe or
listening to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly you find that you are
in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around you they still have
voices and can speak with the ents - that is why they are called huorns
treebeard says - but they have become queer and wild dangerous i should be
terrified of meeting them if there were no true ents about to look after them
well in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper end of
the wizards vale the ents with all their rustling huorns behind we could not
see them of course but the whole air was full of creaking it was very dark a
cloudy night they moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills
and made a noise like a rushing wind the moon did not appear through the
clouds and not long after midnight there was a tall wood all round the north
side of isengard there was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge there was a
light gleaming from a high window in the tower that was all
treebeard and a few more ents crept on right round to within sight of the
great gates pippin and i were with him we were sitting on treebeards
shoulders and i could feel the quivering tenseness in him but even when they
are roused ents can be very cautious and patient they stood still as carved
stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir trumpets blared and the walls
of isengard echoed we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was
going to begin but nothing of the sort all sarumans people were marching
away i dont know much about this war or about the horsemen of rohan but
saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one
final blow he emptied isengard i saw the enemy go: endless lines of marching
orcs and troops of them mounted on great wolves and there were battalions of
men too many of them carried torches and in the flare i could see their
faces most of them were ordinary men rather tall and dark-haired and grim but
not particularly evil-looking but there were some others that were horrible:
man-high but with goblin-faces sallow leering squint-eyed do you know they
reminded me at once of that southerner at bree: only he was not so obviously
orc-like as most of these were
i thought of him too said aragorn we had many of these half-orcs to deal
with at helms deep it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy of
sarumans but whether he was working with the black riders or for saruman
alone i do not know it is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are
in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must have been ten thousand at the very
least said merry they took an hour to pass out of the gates some went off
down the highway to the fords and some turned away µ and went eastward a
bridge has been built down there about a mile away where the river runs in a
very deep channel you could see it now if you stood up they were all singing
with harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din i thought things looked
very black for rohan but treebeard did not move he said: my business is with
isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could not see what was happening in the dark i believe that
huorns began to move south as soon as the gates were shut again their business
was with orcs i think they were far down the valley in the morning or any rate
there was a shadow there that one couldnt see through
as soon as saruman had sent off all his army our turn came treebeard put
us down and went up to the gates and began hammering on the doors and calling
for saruman there was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls but
arrows are no use against ents they hurt them of course and infuriate them:
like stinging flies but an ent can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a
pin-cushion and take no serious harm they cannot be poisoned for one thing
and their skin seems to be very thick and tougher than bark it takes a very
heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously they dont like axes but there would
have to be a great many axe-men to one ent: a man that hacks once at an ent
never gets a chance of a second blow a punch from an ent-fist crumples up iron
like thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he began to warm up to get
positively "hasty" as he would say he let out a great hoom-hom
and a dozen more ents came striding up an angry ent is terrifying their
fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock and they tear it up like
bread-crust it was like watching the work of great tree-roots in a hundred
years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang-bang crash-crack
in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin and some were
already beginning to eat into the walls like rabbits in a sand-pit i dont
know what saruman thought was happening but anyway he did not know how to deal
with it his wizardry may have been falling off lately of course but anyway i
think he has not much grit not much plain courage alone in a tight place
without a lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what i mean very
different from old gandalf i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly due to
his cleverness in settling at isengard
no said aragorn once he was as great as his fame made him his knowledge
was deep his thought was subtle and his hands marvellously skilled and he had
a power over the minds of others the wise he could persuade and the smaller
folk he could daunt that power he certainly still keeps there are not many in
middle-earth that i should say were safe if they were left alone to talk with
him even now when he has suffered a defeat gandalf elrond and galadriel
perhaps now that his wickedness has been laid bare but very few others
the ents are safe said pippin he seems at one time to have got round
them but never again and anyway he did not understand them and he made the
great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations he had no plan for them
and there was no time to make any once they had set to work as soon as our
attack began the few remaining rats in isengard started bolting through every
hole that the ents made the ents let the men go after they had questioned
them two or three dozen only down at this end i dont think many orc-folk of
any size escaped not from the huorns: there was a wood full of them all round
isengard by that time as well as those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to rubbish and
what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a
panic he seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: i expect he came to
watch his splendid army march out when the ents broke their way in he left in
a hurry they did not spot him at first but the night had opened out and there
was a great light of stars quite enough for ents to see by and suddenly
quickbeam gave a cry "the tree-killer the tree-killer" quickbeam is
a gentle creature but he hates saruman all the more fiercely for that: his
people suffered cruelly from orc-axes he leapt down the path from the inner
gate and he can move like a wind when he is roused there was a pale figure
hurrying away in and out of the shadows of the pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower-door but it was a near thing quickbeam was so
hot after him that he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled
when he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in orthanc it was not long before he set some of
his precious machinery to work by that time there were many ents inside
isengard: some had followed quickbeam and others had burst in from the north
and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage suddenly up
came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to
spout and belch several of the ents got scorched and blistered one of them
beechbone i think he was called a very tall handsome ent got caught in a spray
of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a horrible sight
that sent them mad i thought that they had been really roused before but i
was wrong i saw what it was like at last it was staggering they roared and
boomed and trumpeted until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of
them merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears round
and round the rock of orthanc the ents went striding and storming like a howling
gale breaking pillars hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts tossing
up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves the tower was in the middle of
a spinning whirlwind i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up
hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc but treebeard kept
his head he had not had any burns luckily he did not want his folk to hurt
themselves in their fury and he did not want saruman to escape out of some hole
in the confusion many of the ents were hurling themselves against the
orthanc-rock but that defeated them it is very smooth and hard some wizardry
is in it perhaps older and stronger than sarumans anyway they could not get
a grip on it or make a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding
themselves against it so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted his
enormous voice rose above all the din there was a dead silence suddenly in it
we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower that had a queer effect
on the ents they had been boiling over now they became cold grim as ice and
quiet they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own language i think he was telling them
of a plan he had made in his old head long before then they just faded silently
away in the grey light day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but the watchers were so well
hidden in shadows and kept so still that i could not see them the others went
away north all that day they were busy out of sight most of the time we were
left alone it was a dreary day and we wandered about a bit though we kept out
of the view of the windows of orthanc as much as we could: they stared at us so
threateningly a good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening away south in rohan
and what had become of all the rest of our company every now and then we could
hear in the distance the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises echoing
in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round the circle and went to have a look at what
was going on there was a great shadowy wood of huorns at the head of the
valley and another round the northern wall we did not dare to go in but there
was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside ents and huorns were
digging great pits and trenches and making great pools and dams gathering all
the waters of the isen and every other spring and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came back to the gate he was humming and booming to
himself and seemed pleased he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and
breathed deep i asked him if he was tired
 "tired" he said "tired well no not tired but stiff i
need a good draught of entwash we have worked hard we have done more
stone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long year
before but it is nearly finished when night falls do not linger near this gate
or in the old tunnel water may come through-and it will be foul water for a
while until all the filth of saruman is washed away then isen can run clean
again" he began to pull down a bit more of the walls in a leisurely sort
of way just to amuse himself
we were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep
when the most amazing thing of all happened there was the sound of a rider
coming swiftly up the road merry and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadows under the arch suddenly a great horse came striding up like a
flash of silver it was already dark but i could see the riders face clearly:
it seemed to shine and all his clothes were white i just sat up staring with
my mouth open i tried to call out and couldnt
there was no need he halted just by us and looked down at us gandalf i
said at last but my voice was only a whisper did he say: "hullo pippin
this is a pleasant surprise" no indeed he said: "get up you
tom-fool of a took where in the name of wonder in all this ruin is treebeard
i want him quick"
treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once and there was
a strange meeting i was surprised because neither of them seemed surprised at
all gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him yet we
had told the old ent all about moria but then i remembered a queer look he gave
us at the time i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or had some news of
him but would not say anything in a hurry "dont be hasty" is his
motto but nobody not even elves will say much about gandalfs movements when
he is not there
"hoom gandalf" said treebeard "i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and stone i can master but there is a wizard to manage
here"
"treebeard" said gandalf "i need your help you have done
much but i need more i have about ten thousand orcs to manage"
then those two went off and had a council together in some corner it must
have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandalf was in a tremendous hurry and
was already talking at a great pace before they passed out of hearing they
were only away a matter of minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour then gandalf
came back to us and he seemed relieved almost merry he did say he was glad to
see us then
"but gandalf" i cried "where have you been and have you
seen the others"
"wherever i have been i am back" he answered in the genuine
gandalf manner "yes i have seen some of the others but news must wait
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast but the dawn may be brighter
and if so we shall meet again take care of yourselves and keep away from
orthanc good-bye"
treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone he had evidently
learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it he looked at us and said:
"hm well i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought you said much
less than you might and not more than you should hm this is a bundle of news
and no mistake well now treebeard must get busy again"
before he went we got a little news out of him and it did not cheer us up
at all but for the moment we thought more about you three than about frodo and
sam or about poor boromir for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on or soon would be and that you were in it and might never come out of it
"huorns will help" said treebeard then he went away and we did
not see him again until this morning
it was deep night we lay on top of a pile of stone and could see nothing
beyond it mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round
us the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full of rustlings creakings and a
murmur like voices passing i think that hundreds more of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle later there was a great rumble of thunder
away south and flashes of lightning far away across rohan every now and then
we could see mountain-peaks miles and miles away stab out suddenly black and
white and then vanish and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills
but different at times the whole valley echoed
it must have been about midnight when the ents broke the dams and poured all
the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall down into isengard the
huorn-dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away the moon was sinking
behind the western mountains
isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools they
glittered in the last light of the moon as they spread over the plain every
now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or spouthole great
white steams hissed up smoke rose in billows there were explosions and gusts
of fire one great coil of vapour went whirling up twisting round and round
orthanc until it looked like a tall peak of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit
above and still more water poured in until at last isengard looked like a huge
flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to
the mouth of nan curunír said aragorn we feared that saruman was
brewing some new devilry for us
not he said pippin he was probably choking and not laughing any more by
the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down into all the holes and
there was a dense fog we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we had
rather a fright the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel
and the water was rapidly rising up the steps we thought we were going to get
caught like orcs in a hole but we found a winding stair at the back of the
store-room that brought us out on top of the arch it was a squeeze to get out
as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the
top there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all the fires were quenched and
every cave filled the fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge
umbrella of cloud: it must have been a mile high in the evening there was a
great rainbow over the eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by a
thick drizzle on the mountain-sides it all went very quiet a few wolves howled
mournfully far away the ents stopped the inflow in the night and sent the
isen back into its old course and that was the end of it all
since then the water has been sinking again there must be outlets somewhere
from the caves underneath i think if saruman peeps out of any of his windows
it must look an untidy dreary mess we felt very lonely not even a visible ent
to talk to in all the ruin and no news we spent the night up on top there
above the arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep we had a feeling
that anything might happen at any minute saruman is still in his tower there
was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley i think the ents and
huorns that had been away came back then but where they have all gone to now i
dont know it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round
again and nobody was about and that is about all there is to tell it seems
almost peaceful now after all the turmoil and safer too somehow since gandalf
came back i could sleep
they all fell silent for a while gimli re-filled his pipe there is one
thing i wonder about he said as he lit it with
his flint and tinder: wormtongue you told théoden he was with saruman
how did he get there
oh yes i forgot about him said pippin he did not get here till this
morning we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared
again we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
"i have just come round to see how you are faring my lads he said
and to give you some news huorns have come back alls well aye very well
indeed" he laughed and slapped his thighs "no more orcs in
isengard no more axes and there will be folk coming up from the south before
the day is old some that you may be glad to see"
he had hardly said that when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road we
rushed out before the gates and i stood and stared half expecting to see
strider and gandalf come riding up at the head of an army but out of the mist
there rode a man on an old tired horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of
creature himself there was no one else when he came out of the mist and
suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he sat and gaped and
his face went almost green he was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice
us at first when he did he gave a cry and tried to turn his horse round and
ride off but treebeard took three strides put out
a long arm and lifted him out of the saddle his horse bolted in terror and he
grovelled on the ground he said he was gríma friend and counsellor of
the king and had been sent with important messages from théoden
to saruman
"no one else would dare to ride through the open land so full of foul
orcs" he said "so i was sent and i have had a perilous journey and
i am hungry and weary i fled far north out of my way pursued by wolves"
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard and i said to myself
"liar" treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several
minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor then at last he said:
"ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue" the man started at
that name "gandalf got here first so i know as much about you as i need
and i know what to do with you put all the rats in one trap said gandalf and
i will i am the master of isengard now but saruman is locked in his tower and
you can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of"
"let me go let me go" said wormtongue "i know the
way"
"you knew the way i dont doubt" said treebeard "but
things have changed here a little go and see"
he let wormtongue go and he limped off through the arch with us close
behind until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay
between him and orthanc then he turned to us
"let me go away" he whined "let me go away my messages are
useless now"
"they are indeed" said treebeard "but you have only two
choices: to stay with me until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the
water which will you have"
the man shivered at the mention of his master and put a foot into the
water but he drew back "i cannot swim" he said
"the water is not deep" said treebeard "it is dirty but
that will not harm you master wormtongue in you go now"
with that the wretch floundered off into the flood it rose up nearly to his
neck before he got too far away for me to see him the last i saw of him was
clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood but treebeard waded after him and
watched his progress
"well he has gone in" he said when he returned "i saw him
crawling up the steps like a draggled rat there is someone in the tower still:
a hand came out and pulled him in so there he is and i hope the welcome is to
his liking now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime ill be away up on
the north side if anyone wants to see me there is no clean water down here fit
for an ent to drink or to bathe in so i will ask you two lads to keep a watch
at the gate for the folk that are coming therell be the lord of the fields of
rohan mark you you must welcome him as well as you know how: his men have
fought a great fight with the orcs maybe you know the right fashion of mens
words for such a lord better than ents there have been many lords in the green
fields in my time and i have never learned their speech or their names they
will be wanting man-food and you know all about that i guess so find what you
think is fit for a king to eat if you can" and that is the end of the
story though i should like to know who this wormtongue is was he really the
kings counsellor
he was said aragorn and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan fate
has not been kinder to him than he deserves the sight of the ruin of all that
he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kindness said
merry he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to
himself when he went to get his bathe and drink we spent a busy time after
that searching the flotsam and rummaging about we found two or three
store-rooms in different places nearby above the flood-level but treebeard
sent some ents down and they carried off a great deal of the stuff
"we want man-food for twenty-five" the ents said so you can see
that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived you three
were evidently meant to go with the great people but you would not have fared
any better we kept as good as we sent i promise you better because we sent
no drink
"what about drink" i said to the ents
"there is water of isen" they said "and that is good enough
for ents and men" but i hope that the ents may have found time to brew
some of their draughts from the mountain-springs and we shall see gandalfs
beard curling when he returns after the ents had gone we felt tired and
hungry but we did not grumble - our labours had been well rewarded it was
through our search for man-food that pippin discovered the prize of all the
flotsam those hornblower barrels "pipe-weed is better after food"
said pippin that is how the situation arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn: leaf from the southfarthing in
isengard the more i consider it the more curious i find it i have never been
in isengard but i have journeyed in this land and i know well the empty
countries that lie between rohan and the shire neither goods nor folk have
passed that way for many a long year not openly saruman had secret dealings
with someone in the shire i guess wormtongues may
be found in other houses than king théodens was there a date on the
barrels
yes said pippin it was the 1417 crop that is last years no the year
before of course now: a good year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now i hope or else it is beyond
our reach at present said aragorn yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf
small matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what he is doing said merry the afternoon is getting on let us
go and look round you can enter isengard now at any rate strider if you want
to but it is not a very cheerful sight
 
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones gazing
at the dark rock of orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolation that lay all about it the waters had now nearly all subsided here
and there gloomy pools remained covered with scum and wreckage but most of the
wide circle was bare again a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock pitted with
blackened holes and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way
and that at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes
like the shingles cast up by a great storm and beyond them the green and
tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the
mountains across the waste they saw riders picking their way they were coming
from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and théoden and his men said legolas let
us go and meet them
walk warily said merry there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take care
they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orthanc going
slowly for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed the riders seeing them
approach halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them gandalf rode
forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and made a few
plans he said and we have all had some much-needed rest now we must be
going on again i hope you companions have all rested too and refreshed
yourselves
we have said merry but our discussions began and ended in smoke still
we feel less ill-disposed towards saruman than we did
do you indeed said gandalf well i do not i have now a last task to do
before i go: i must pay saruman a farewell visit dangerous and probably
useless but it must be done those of you who wish may come with me - but
beware and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will come said gimli i wish to see him and learn if he really looks
like you
and how will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf saruman could
look like me in your eyes if it suited his purpose with you and are you yet
wise enough to detect all his counterfeits well we shall see perhaps he may
be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together but i have
ordered all the ents to remove themselves from sight so perhaps we shall
persuade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin will he shoot at us and pour fire out of
the windows or can he put a spell on us from a distance
the last is most likely if you ride to his door with a light heart said
gandalf but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try a wild
beast cornered is not safe to approach and saruman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice
they came now to the foot of orthanc it was black and the rock gleamed as
if it were wet the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as though they had
been newly chiselled a few scorings and small flake-like splinters near the
base were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers there was a great door high
above the ground and over it was a shuttered window opening upon a balcony
hedged with iron bars up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of
twenty-seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but many tall windows were cut with
deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in
the sheer faces of the horns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted i will go up
said gandalf i have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i too will go up said the king i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong éomer shall
come with me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf aragorn shall come with me let the others
await us at the foot of the stairs they will hear and see enough if there is
anything to hear or see
nay said gimli legolas and i wish for a closer view we alone here
represent our kindred we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed the steps and théoden
went beside him
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on either side of the
stair and looked up darkly at the great tower fearing what might befall their
lord merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and
unsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin i wish i could
slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed what did we come for we are not
wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat on it with his staff it
rang with a hollow sound saruman saruman he cried in a loud commanding
voice saruman come forth
for some time there was no answer at last the window above the door was
unbarred hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice what do you wish
théoden started i know that voice he said and i curse the day
when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become his footman gríma
wormtongue said gandalf and do not waste our time
the window closed they waited suddenly another voice spoke low and
melodious its very sound an enchantment those who listened unwarily to that
voice could seldom report the words that they heard and if they did they
wondered for little power remained in them mostly they remembered only that it
was a delight to hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise and
reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast and if they
gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in the hearts of those under the spell
fur some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them and when it spake
to another they smiled as men do who see through a jugglers trick while others
gape at it for many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them
enthralled but for those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far
away and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them but none
were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind
and will so long as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle question why must you disturb my rest will
you give me no peace at all by night or day its tone was that of a kindly
heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound of his coming and
they saw a figure standing at the rail looking down upon them: an old man
swathed in a great cloak the colour of which was not easy to tell for it
changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred his face was long with a
high forehead he had deep darkling eyes hard to fathom though the look that
they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weary his hair and beard
were white but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the soft voice two at
least of you i know by name gandalf i know too well to have much hope that he
seeks help or counsel here but you théoden lord of the mark of rohan
are declared by your noble devices and still more by the fair countenance of
the house of eorl o worthy son of thengel the thrice-renowned why have you not
come before and as a friend much have i desired to see you mightiest king of
western lands and especially in these latter years to save you from the unwise
and evil counsels that beset you is it yet too late despite the injuries that
have been done to me in which the men of rohan alas have had some part still
i would save you and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if
you ride upon this road which you have taken indeed i alone can aid you now
théoden opened his mouth as if to speak but he said nothing he
looked up at the face of saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him
and then to gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate gandalf made
no sign but stood silent as stone as one waiting patiently for some call that
has not yet come the riders stirred at first murmuring with approval of the
words of saruman and then they too were silent as men spell-bound it seemed
to them that gandalf had never spoken so fair and
fittingly to their lord rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with théoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of a great danger: the end of the
mark in a darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stood
beside a door of escape holding it half open so that a ray of light came
through there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly the words of this wizard stand
on their heads he growled gripping the handle of his axe in the language of
orthanc help means ruin and saving means slaying that is plain but we do not
come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his voice was less suave
and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone i
do not speak to you yet gimli glóins son he said far away is your
home and small concern of yours are the troubles of this land but it was not by
design of your own that you became embroiled in them and so i will not blame
such part as you have played-a valiant one i doubt not but i pray you
allow me first to speak with the king of rohan my neighbour and once my
friend
what have you to say théoden king will you have peace with me and
all the aid that my knowledge founded in long years can bring shall we
make our counsels together against evil days and repair our injuries with such
good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever before
still théoden did not answer whether he strove with anger or doubt
none could say éomer spoke
lord hear me he said now we feel the peril that we were warned of have
we ridden forth to victory only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with
honey on his forked tongue so would the trapped wolf speak to the hounds if
he could what aid can he give to you forsooth all he desires is to escape
from his plight but will you parley with this dealer in treachery and murder
remember théodred at the fords and the grave of háma in helms
deep
if we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we
say of yours young serpent said saruman and the flash of his anger was now
plain to see but come éomer éomunds son he went on in his
soft voice again to every man h part valour in arms is yours and you win high
honour thereby slay whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand but maybe if you become a
king you will find that he must choose his friends with care the friendship of
saruman and the power of orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside whatever
grievances real or fancied may lie behind you have won a battle but not a war
and that with help on which you cannot count again you may find the shadow of
the wood at your own door next: it is wayward and senseless and has no love
for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called a murderer because valiant men have
fallen in battle if you go to war needlessly for i did not desire it then
men will be slain but if i am a murderer on that account then all the house
of eorl is stained with murder for they have fought many wars and assailed
many who defied them yet with some they have afterwards made peace none the
worse for being politic i say théoden king: shall we have peace and
friendship you and i it is ours to command 
we will have peace said théoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly théoden held up his hand yes
we will have peace he said now in a clear voice we will have peace when
you and all your works have perished - and the works of your dark master
to whom you would deliver us you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens
hearts you hold out your hand to me and i perceive only a finger of the claw
of mordor cruel and cold even if your war on me was just as it was not for
were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your
own profit as you desired - even so what will you say of your torches in
westfold and the children that lie dead there and they hewed hámas
body before the gates of the hornburg after he was dead when you hang from a
gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows i will have peace with
you and orthanc so much for the house of eorl a lesser son of great sires am
i but i do not need to lick your fingers turn elsewhither but i fear
your voice has lost its charm
the riders gazed up at théoden like men startled out of a dream harsh
as an old ravens their masters voice sounded in their ears after the music of
saruman but saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath he leaned
over the rail as if he would smite the king with his staff to some suddenly it
seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed and they shuddered at the hideous change
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in
the reek and their brats roll on the floor among the dogs too long have they
escaped the gibbet themselves but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight
and hard in the end hang if you will now his
voice changed as he slowly mastered himself i know not why i have had the
patience to speak to you for i need you not nor your little band of gallopers
as swift to fly as to advance théoden horsemaster long ago i
offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit i have offered it again so
that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads you give me
brag and abuse so be it go back to your huts
but you gandalf for you at least i am grieved feeling for your shame how
comes it that you can endure such company for you are proud gandalf-and not
without reason having a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far even
now will you not listen to my counsel
gandalf stirred and looked up what have you to say that you did not say at
our last meeting he asked or perhaps you have things to unsay
saruman paused unsay he mused as if puzzled unsay i endeavoured to
advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened you are proud and do
not love advice having indeed a store of your own wisdom but on that occasion
you erred i think misconstruing my intentions wilfully i fear that in my
eagerness to persuade you i lost patience and indeed i regret it for i bore
you no ill-will and even now i bear none though you return to me in the
company of the violent and the ignorant how should i are we not both members
of a high and ancient order most excellent in middle-earth our friendship
would profit us both alike much we could still accomplish together to heal the
disorders of the world let us understand one another and dismiss from thought
these lesser folk let them wait on our decisions for the common good i am
willing to redress the past and to receive you will you not consult with me
will you not come up
so great was the power that saruman exerted in this last effort that none
that stood within hearing were unmoved but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an erring but
much-loved minister but they were shut out listening at a door to words not
meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants overhearing the elusive
discourse of their elders and wondering how it would affect their lot of
loftier mould these two were made: reverend and wise it was inevitable that
they should make alliance gandalf would ascend into the tower to discuss deep
things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc the door
would be closed and they would be left outside
dismissed to await allotted work or punishment even in the mind of théoden
the thought took shape like a shadow of doubt: he will betray us he will go -
we shall be lost
then gandalf laughed the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said gandalf still laughing saruman you missed your
path in life you should have been the kings jester and earned your bread and
stripes too by mimicking his counsellors ah me he paused getting the better
of his mirth understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i understand now too well i keep a clearer memory of your
arguments and deeds than you suppose when last i visited you you were the
jailor of mordor and there i was to be sent nay the guest who has escaped
from the roof will think twice before he comes back in by the door nay i do
not think i will come up but listen saruman for the last time will you not
come down isengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it so
may other things in which you still have trust would it not be well to leave it
for a while to turn to new things perhaps think well saruman will you not
come down
a shadow passed over sarumans face then it went deathly white before he
could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt
loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge for a second he hesitated
and no one breathed then he spoke and his voice was shrill and cold pride and
hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked does an unarmed man come down to speak with
robbers out of doors i can hear you well enough here i am no fool and i do
not trust you gandalf they do not stand openly on my stairs but i know where
the wild wood-demons are lurking at your command
the treacherous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily but you
need not fear for your skin i do not wish to kill you or hurt you as you
would know if you really understood me and i have the power to protect you i
am giving you a last chance you can leave orthanc free - if you choose
that sounds well sneered saruman very much in the manner of gandalf the
grey: so condescending and so very kind i do not doubt that you would find
orthanc commodious and my departure convenient but why should i wish to leave
and what do you mean by free there are conditions i presume
reasons for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others will occur to your thought your servants are destroyed and scattered
your neighbours you have made your enemies and you have cheated your new
master or tried to do so when his eye turns hither it will be the red eye of
wrath but when i say free i mean free: free from bond of chain or
command: to go where you will even even to mordor saruman if you desire but
you will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and your staff they shall be
pledges of your conduct to be returned later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage
and a red light was kindled in his eyes he laughed wildly later he cried
and his voice rose to a scream later yes when you also have the keys of
barad-dûr itself i suppose and the crowns of seven kings and the
rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes
larger than those that you wear now a modest plan hardly one in which my help
is needed i have other things to do do not be a fool if you wish to treat
with me while you have a chance go away and come back when you are sober and
leave behind these cut-throats and small rag-tag that dangle at your tail good
day he turned and left the balcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commanding voice to the amazement of
the others saruman turned again and as if dragged against his will he came
slowly back to the iron rail leaning on it breathing hard his face was lined
and shrunken his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly i have not finished
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiable you might still have turned
away from folly and evil and have been of service but you choose to stay and
gnaw the ends of your old plots stay then but i warn you you will not easily
come out again not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out to take you
saruman he cried and his voice grew in power and authority behold i am not
gandalf the grey whom you betrayed i am gandalf the white who has returned
from death you have no colour now and i cast you from the order and from the
council
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice saruman your
staff is broken there was a crack and the staff split asunder in sarumans
hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet go said gandalf with a
cry saruman fell back and crawled away at that moment a heavy shining thing
came hurtling down from above it glanced off the iron rail even as saruman
left it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the stair on which he
stood the rail rang and snapped the stair cracked and splintered in glittering
sparks but the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps a globe of
crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire as it bounded away towards a
pool pippin ran after it and picked it up
the murderous rogue cried éomer but gandalf was unmoved no that
was not thrown b saruman he said nor even at his bidding i think it came
from a window far above a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy
but ill aimed
the aim was poor maybe because he could not make up his mind which he
hated more you or saruman said aragorn
that may be so said gandalf small comfort will those two have in their
companionship: they will gnaw one another with words but the punishment is
just if wormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will be more than he
deserves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask you to handle it he cried
turning sharply and seeing pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he were
bearing a great weight he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe
from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak i will take care of
this he said it is not a thing i guess that saruman would have chosen to
cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli if that is the end of
the debate let us go out of stones throw at least
it is the end said gandalf let us go
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc and went down the riders
hailed the king with joy and saluted gandalf the spell of saruman was broken:
they had seen him come at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandalf now i must find treebeard and tell him
how things have gone
he will have guessed surely said merry were they likely to end any
other way
not likely answered gandalf though they came to the balance of a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so first saruman was
shown that the power of his voice was waning he cannot be both tyrant and
counsellor when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret yet he fell into
the trap and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal while others listened
then i gave him a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both mordor and his
private schemes and make amends by helping us in our need he knows our need
none better great service he could have rendered but he has chosen to withhold
it and keep the power of orthanc he will not serve only command he lives now
in terror of the shadow of mordor and yet he still dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he will be devoured if the power of the east stretches out its
arms to isengard we cannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron - who knows
what he can do
and what if sauron does not conquer what will you do to him asked pippin
i nothing said gandalf i will do nothing to him i do not wish for
mastery what w ill become of him i cannot say i grieve that so much that was
good now festers in the tower still for us things have not gone badly strange
are the turns of fortune often does hatred hurt itself i guess that even if
we had entered in we could have found few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddenly cut off came from an open window high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf let us leave them
they returned now to the ruins of the gate hardly had they passed out under
the arch when from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood
treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up aragorn gimli and legolas
gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf i have spoken of
them but you have not yet seen them he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas so you have come all the way from mirkwood my good
elf a very great forest it used to be
and still is said legolas but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood i
scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and i did not wish to turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure i hope you may have your wish ere
the hills be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas i have made a bargain
with my friend that if all goes well we will visit fangorn together - by your
leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome said treebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said legolas i mean gimli glóins
son here gimli bowed low and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on
the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard looking dark-eyed at him a dwarf and an
axe-bearer hoom i have good will to elves but you ask much this is a strange
friendship strange it may seem said legolas but while gimli lives i shall
not come to fangorn alone his axe is not for trees but for orc-necks o
fangorn master of fangorns wood forty-two he hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard that is a better story well well things
will go as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them but now we
must part for a while day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you must go
ere nightfall and the lord of the mark is eager for his own house
yes we must go and go now said gandalf i fear that i must take your
gatekeepers from you but you will manage well enough without them
maybe i shall said treebeard but i shall miss them we have become
friends in so short a while that i think i must be getting hasty - growing
backwards towards youth perhaps but there they are the first new thing under
sun or moon that i have seen for many a long long day i shall not forget them
i have put their names into the long list ents will remember it
ents the earthborn old as mountains

the wide-walkers water drinking

and hungry as hunters the hobbit children

the laughing-folk the little people
they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed fare you well but
if you hear news up in your pleasant land in the shire send me word you know
what i mean: word or sight of the entwives come yourselves if you can
we will said merry and pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his head
thoughtfully then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said i did not think he would his heart
is as rotten as a black huorns still if i were overcome and all my trees
destroyed i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
no said gandalf but you have not plotted to cover all the world with
your trees and choke all other living things but there it is saruman remains
to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can he has the key of
orthanc but he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebeard saruman shall not set
foot beyond the rock without my leave ents will watch over him
good said gandalf that is what i hoped now i can go and turn to other
matters with one care the less but you must be wary the waters have gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower i fear i do not doubt
that there were deep ways delved under orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and
come unmarked before long if you will undertake the labour i beg you to pour
in the waters again and do so until isengard remains a standing pool or you
discover the outlets when all the underground places are drowned and the
outlets blocked then saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the ents said treebeard we shall search the valley from head
to foot and peer under every pebble trees are coming back to live here old
trees wild trees the watchwood we will call it not a squirrel will go here
but i shall know of it leave it to ents until seven times the years in which
he tormented us have passed we shall not tire of watching him
chapter 11

the palantír
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when gandalf
and his companions and the king with his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn took pippin two of the kings men
went on ahead riding swiftly and passed soon out of sight down into the
valley the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate with their long arms
uplifted but they made no sound merry and pippin looked back when they had
passed some way down the winding road sunlight was still shining in the sky
but long shadows reached over isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump of an old tree: the
hobbits thought of their first meeting upon the sunny ledge far away on the
borders of fangorn
they came to the pillar of the white hand the pillar was still standing but
the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces right in the
middle of the road the long forefinger lay white in the dusk its red nail
darkening to black
the ents pay attention to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after a while i dont
know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you but the rag-tag is
tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf dont let it rankle be thankful no
longer words were aimed at you he had his eyes on you if it is any comfort to
your pride i should say that at the moment you and pippin are more in his
thoughts than all the rest of us who you are how you came there and why what
you know whether you were captured and if so how you escaped when all the
orcs perished - it is with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman
is troubled a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you feel honoured
by his concern
thank you said merry but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail
gandalf for one thing in that position one has a chance of putting a question
a second time are we riding far tonight
gandalf laughed a most unquenchable hobbit all wizards should have a
hobbit or two in their care - to teach them the meaning of the word and to
correct them i beg your pardon but i have given thought even to these simple
matters we will ride for a few hours gently until we come to the end of the
valley tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight from isengard back to the kings house
at edoras over the plains a ride of some days but we have taken thought and
changed the plan messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them that
the king is returning tomorrow he will ride from there with many men to
dunharrow by paths among the hills from now on no more than two or three
together are to go openly over the land by day or night when it can be
avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry i am afraid i was not
looking beyond tonights bed where and what are helms deep and all the rest of
it i dont know anything about this country
then youd best learn something if you wish to understand what is
happening but not just now and not from me: i have too many pressing things to
think about
all right ill tackle strider by the camp-fire: hes less testy but why
all this secrecy i thought wed won the battle
yes we have won but only the first victor and
that in itself increases our danger there was some link between isengard and
mordor which i have not yet fathomed how they exchanged news i am not sure
but they did so the eye of barad-dûr will be looking impatiently
towards the wizards vale i think and towards rohan the less it sees the
better
the road passed slowly winding down the valley now further and now nearer
isen flowed in its stony bed night came down from the mountains all the mists
were gone a chill wind blew the moon now waxing round filled the eastern sky
with a pale cold sheen the shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down
to bare hills the wide plains opened grey before them
at last they halted then they turned aside leaving the highway and taking
to the sweet upland turf again going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into the slope of round dol baran the last
hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather the sides of the
glen were shaggy with last years bracken among which the tight-curled fronds
of spring were just thrusting through the sweet-scented earth thornbushes grew
thick upon the low banks and under them they made their camp two hours or so
before the middle of the night they lit a fire in a hollow down among the
roots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a tree writhen with age but hale in
every limb buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch the rest after they had supped wrapped
themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept the hobbits lay in a corner by
themselves upon a pile of old bracken merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed
curiously restless the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matter asked merry are you lying on an ant-hill
no said pippin but im not comfortable i wonder how long it is since i
slept in a bed
merry yawned work it out on your fingers he said but you must know how
long it is since we left lórien
oh that said pippin i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then said merry but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck merry said pippin softly after a long pause you were
riding with gandalf
well what of it
did you get any news any information out of him
yes a good deal more than usual but you heard it all or most of it: you
were close by and we were talking no secrets but you can go with him tomorrow
if you think you can get more out of him-and if hell have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a little and beginning to wonder what
was bothering his companion he has grown or something he can be both kinder
and more alarming merrier and more solemn than before i think he has changed
but we have not had a chance to see how much yet but think of the last part of
that business with saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs superior: head
of the council whatever that may be exactly he was saruman the white gandalf
is the white now saruman came when he was told and his rod was taken and then
he was just told to go and he went
well if gandalf has changed at all then hes closer than ever thats all
pippin argued that-glass ball now he seemed mighty pleased with it he knows
or guesses something about it but does he tell us what no not a word yet i
picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool here ill take that
my lad - thats all i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy pippins
voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
hullo said merry so thats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildors saying - the one sam used to quote: do not meddle in
the at fairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of
wizards said pippin i should like a bit of information as well as danger i
should like a look at that ball
go to sleep said merry youll get information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for inquisitiveness but is this
the time i ask you
all right whats the harm in my telling you what i should like: a look at
that stone i know i cant have it with old gandalf sitting on it like a hen
on an egg but it doesnt help much to get no more from you than a you-cant-have-it
so-go-to-sleep
well what else could i say said merry im sorry pippin but you really
must wait till the morning ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard-wheedling but i cant keep awake any
longer if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears good night
pippin said no more he lay still now but sleep remained far away and it
was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing softly asleep in a few
minutes after saying good night the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow
stronger as all grew quiet pippin felt again its weight in his hands and saw
again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment he tossed
and turned and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer he got up and looked round it was
chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him the moon was shining cold and white
down into the dell and the shadows of the bushes were black all about lay
sleeping shapes the two guards were not in view: they were up on the hill
perhaps or hidden in the bracken driven by some impulse that he did not
understand pippin walked softly to where gandalf lay he looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed: there was a glitter of
eyes under his long lashes pippin stepped back hastily but gandalf made no
sign and drawn forward once more half against his will the hobbit crept up
again from behind the wizards head he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak
spread over the top and close beside him between his right side and his bent
arm there was a hummock something round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand
seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot by foot at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted the lump up: it did not
seem quite so heavy as he had expected only some bundle of oddments perhaps
after all he thought with a strange sense of relief but he did not put the
bundle down again he stood for a moment clasping it then an idea came into his
mind he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone in it and kneeling down
laid it back by the wizards hand then at last he looked at the thing that he
had uncovered there it was: a smooth globe of crystal now dark and dead lying
bare before his knees pippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back to his bed at that moment gandalf moved in his
sleep and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue his hand
groped out and clasped the wrapped stone then he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself youre going to get yourself
into frightful trouble put it back quick but he found now that his knees
quaked and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it back now without waking him he thought not till im a bit
calmer so i may as well have a look first not just here though he stole
away and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed the moon looked in
over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them he bent low
over it looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food in a corner
away from others he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it the air seemed still
and tense about him at first the globe was dark black as jet with the
moonlight gleaming on its surface then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that now he could not look away soon all
the inside seemed on fire the ball was spinning or the lights within were
revolving suddenly the lights went out he gave a gasp and struggled but he
remained bent clasping the ball with both hands closer and closer he bent and
then became rigid his lips moved soundlessly for a while then with a strangled
cry he fell back and lay still
the cry was piercing the guards leapt down from the banks all the camp was
soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf hastily he cast his cloak over the
globe where it lay but you pippin this is a grievous turn to things he
knelt by pippins body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid with unseeing
eyes staring up at the sky the devilry what mischief has he done-to himself
and to all of us the wizards face was drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening for his breath then
he laid his hands on his brow the hobbit shuddered his eyes closed he cried
out and sat up staring in bewilderment at all the faces round him pale in the
moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried in a shrill and toneless voice
shrinking away from gandalf i will send for it at once do you understand say
just that then he struggled to get up and escape but gandalf held him gently
and firmly
peregrin took he said come back
the hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand gandalf
he cried gandalf forgive me
forgive you said the wizard tell me first what you have done
i i took the ball and looked at it stammered pippin and i saw things
that frightened me and i wanted to go away but i couldnt and then he came
and questioned me and he looked at me and and that is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly what did you see and what did you
say
pippin shut his eyes and shivered but said nothing they all stared at him
in silence except merry who turned away but gandalfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly his words grew
clearer and stronger i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said and
tiny stars it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear then the
stars went in and out-they were cut off by things with wings very big i think
really but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower i
thought there were nine of them one began to fly straight towards me getting
bigger and bigger it had a horrible - no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it would fly out but when it had
covered all the globe it disappeared then he came he did not speak so
that i could hear words he just looked and i understood
"so you have come back why have you neglected to report for so
long"
i did not answer he said: "who are you" i still did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i said: "a hobbit"
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me it was cruel it
was like being stabbed with knives i struggled but he said: "wait a
moment we shall meet again soon tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once do you understand say just that"
then he gloated over me i felt i was falling to pieces no no i cant say
any more i dont remember anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into his eyes the wizard held his gaze for a
moment in silence then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smile
appeared he laid his hand softly on pippins head
all right he said say no more you have taken no harm there is no lie
in your eyes as i feared but he did not speak long with you a fool but an
honest fool you remain peregrin took wiser ones might have done worse in such
a pass but mark this you have been saved and all your friends too mainly by
good fortune as it is called you cannot count on it a second time if he had
questioned you then and there almost certainly you would have told all that
you know to the ruin of us all but he was too eager he did not want
information only: he wanted you quickly so that he could deal with you in the
dark tower slowly dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs of wizards
you must be prepared to think of such things but come i forgive you be
comforted things have not turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed merry followed and
sat down beside him lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
trust me if you feel an itch in your palms again tell me of it such things
can be cured but anyway my dear hobbit dont put a lump of rock under my
elbow again now i will leave you two together for a while
with that gandalf returned to the others who were still standing by the
orthanc-stone in troubled thought peril comes in the night when least
expected he said we have had a narrow escape
how is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf he was not held long and
hobbits have an amazing power of recovery the memory or the horror of it will
probably fade quickly too quickly perhaps will you aragorn take the
orthanc-stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to all said aragorn there is one who may claim
it by right for this assuredly is the palantír
of orthanc from the treasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor now my
hour draws near i will take it
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise of the others he lifted
the covered stone and bowed as he presented it
receive it lord he said: in earnest of other things that shall be given
back but if i may counsel you in the use of your own do not use it - yet be
wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited and prepared for so many
long years said aragorn
never yet do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secret you and all others that stand here
the hobbit peregrin above all should not know where it is bestowed the evil
fit may come on him again for alas he has handled it and looked in it as
should never have happened he ought never to have touched it in isengard and
there i should have been quicker but my mind was bent on saruman and i did not
at once guess the nature of the stone then i was weary and as i lay pondering
it sleep overcame me now i know
yes there can be no doubt said aragorn at last we know the link
between isengard and mordor and how it worked
much is explained strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses
said théoden but it has long been said: oft evil will shall
evil mar
that many times is seen said gandalf but at this time we have been
strangely fortunate maybe i have been saved by this hobbit from a grave
blunder i had considered whether or not to probe this stone myself to find its
uses had i done so i should have been revealed to him myself i am not ready
for such a trial if indeed i shall ever be so: but even if i found the power to
withdraw myself it would be disastrous for him to see me yet - until the hour
comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf there remains a short while of doubt which we must
use the enemy it is clear thought that the stone was in orthanc - why should
he not and that therefore the hobbit was captive there driven to look in the
glass for his torment by saruman that dark mind will be filled now with the
voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before
he learns his error we must snatch that time we have been too leisurely we
must move the neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in i will
ride ahead at once with peregrin took it will be better for him than lying in
the dark while others sleep
i will keep éomer and ten riders said the king they shall ride
with me at early day the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon as they have
a mind
as you will said gandalf but make all the speed you may to the cover of
the hills to helms deep
at that moment a shadow fell over them the bright moonlight seemed to be
suddenly cut off several of the riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms above their heads as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind fear and a
deadly cold fell on them cowering they looked up a vast winged shape passed
over the moon like a black cloud it wheeled and went north flying at a speed
greater than any wind of middle-earth the stars fainted before it it was gone
they stood up rigid as stones gandalf was gazing up his arms out and
downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgûl he cried the messenger of mordor the storm is coming the
nazgûl have crossed the river ride ride wait not for the dawn
let not the swift wait for the slow ride
he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran aragorn followed him going to
pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms you shall come with me this time
he said shadowfax shall show you his paces then he ran to the place where he
had slept shadowfax stood there already slinging the small bag which was all
his luggage across his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cloak and
blanket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf away shadowfax
the great horse tossed his head his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone like the north wind from
the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to aragorn some folk have
wonderful luck he did not want to sleep and he wanted to ride with gandalf -
and there he goes instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here
for ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the orthanc-stone and not he how would
it be now said aragorn you might have done worse who can say but now it is
your luck to come with me i fear at once go and get ready and bring anything
that pippin left behind make haste
over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance less
than an hour had passed and they had reached the fords of isen and crossed
them the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
pippin was recovering he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and
refreshing he was with gandalf the horror of the stone and of the hideous
shadow over the moon was fading things left behind in the mists of the
mountains or in a passing dream he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode bare-back gandalf he said you havent a saddle
or a bridle
i do not ride elf-fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf but
shadowfax will have no harness you do not ride shadowfax: he is willing to
carry you-or not if he is willing that is enough it is then his business to
see that you remain on his back unless you jump off into the air
how fast is he going asked pippin fast by the wind but very smooth and
how light his footfalls are
he is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop answered
gandalf but that is not fast for him the land is rising a little here and is
more broken than it was beyond the river but see how the white mountains are
drawing near under the stars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the
deeping-coomb where the battle was fought two nights ago
pippin was silent again for a while he heard gandalf singing softly to
himself murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran
under them at last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the
words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the wind:
tall ships and tall kings

three times three

what brought they from the foundered land

over the flowing sea

seven stars and seven stones

and one white tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes of lore in my mind  answered the
wizard hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even those that they ever
knew
no not all said pippin and we have many of our own which wouldnt
interest you perhaps but i have never heard this one what is it about - the
seven stars and seven stones
about the palantíri of the
kings of old said gandalf
and what are they
the name meant that which looks far away the orthanc-stone was one
then it was not made not made - pippin hesitated - by the enemy
no said gandalf nor by saruman it is beyond his art and beyond
saurons too the palantíri
came from beyond westernesse from eldamar the noldor made them fëanor
himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago that the time cannot be
measured in years but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil
uses alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceive perilous to us
all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves yet he must bear
the blame fool to keep it secret for his own profit no word did he ever
speak of it to any of the council we had not yet given thought to the fate of
the palantíri of gondor in its
ruinous wars by men they were almost forgotten even in gondor they were a
secret known only to a few in arnor they were
remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the dúnedain
what did the men of old use them for asked pippin delighted and
astonished at getting answers to so many questions and wondering how long it
would last
to see far off and to converse in thought with one another said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor they set up
stones at minas anor and at minas ithil and at orthanc in the ring of
isengard the chief and master of these was under the
dome of stars at osgiliath before its ruin the three others were far away in
the north in the house of elrond it is told that they were at annúminas
and amon sûl and elendils stone was on the tower hills that look towards
mithlond in the gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantír replied to
each but all those in gondor were ever open to the view of osgiliath now it
appears that as the rock of orthanc has withstood the storms of time so there
the palantír of that tower has
remained but alone it could do nothing but see
small images of things far off and days remote very useful no doubt that was
to saruman yet it seems that he was not content further and further abroad he
gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad-dûr then he was caught
who knows where the lost stones of arnor and gondor now lie buried or
drowned deep but one at least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his
purposes i guess that it was the ithil-stone for he took minas ithil long ago
and turned it into an evil place: minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of saruman was trapped
and held and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when
persuasion would not serve the biter bit the hawk under the
eagles foot the spider in a steel web how long i wonder has he been
constrained to come often to his glass for inspection and instruction and the
orthanc-stone so bent towards barad-dûr that if any save a will of
adamant now looks into it it will bear his mind and sight swiftly
thither and how it draws one to itself have i not felt it even now my heart
desires to test my will upon it to see if i could not wrench it from him and
turn it where i would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time
to tirion the fair and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of fëanor
at their work while both the white tree and the golden were in flower he
sighed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin i had no notion of what i
was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf you knew you were behaving wrongly and
foolishly and you told yourself so though you did not listen i did not tell
you all this before because it is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last understood even as we ride together but if i had spoken sooner
it would not have lessened your desire or made it easier to resist on the
contrary no the burned hand teaches best after that advice about fire goes to
the heart
it does said pippin if all the seven stones were laid out before me now
i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
good said gandalf that is what i hoped
but i should like to know- pippin began
mercy cried gandalf if the giving of information is to be the cure of
your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you
what more do you want to know
the names of all the stars and of all living things and the whole history
of middle-earth and over-heaven and of the sundering seas  laughed pippin of
course what less but i am not in a hurry tonight at the moment i was just
wondering about the black shadow i heard you shout "messenger of
mordor" what was it what could it do at isengard
it was a black rider on wings a nazgûl
said gandalf it could have taken you away to the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin i mean it didnt
know that i had… 
of course not said gandalf it is two hundred leagues or more in straight
flight from barad-dûr to orthanc and even a
nazgûl would take a few hours to fly between them but saruman certainly
looked in the stone since the orc-raid and more of his secret thought i do not
doubt has been read than he intended a messenger has been sent to find
out what he is doing and after what has happened tonight another will come i
think and swiftly so saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he
has put his hand in he has no captive to send he has no stone to see with and
cannot answer the summons sauron will only believe that he is withholding the
captive and refusing to use the stone it will not help saruman to tell the
truth to the messenger for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in
orthanc so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel yet he rejected us
so as to avoid that very thing what he will do in such a plight i cannot
guess he has power still i think while in orthanc to resist the nine riders
he may try to do so he may try to trap the nazgûl
or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air in that case let
rohan look to its horses
but i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill for us it may be that
the counsels of the enemy will be confused or hindered by his wrath with
saruman it may be that he will learn that i was there and stood upon the stairs
of orthanc-with hobbits at my tail or that an heir of elendil lives and stood
beside me if wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan he would
remember aragorn and the title that he claimed that is what i fear and so we
fly - not from danger but into greater danger every stride of shadowfax bears
you nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as if a sudden chill had
struck him grey land passed under them
see now said gandalf the westfold dales are opening before us here we
come back to the eastward road the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the
deeping-coomb that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves do not ask me
about them ask gimli if you meet again and for the first time you may get an
answer longer than you wish you will not see the caves yourself not on this
journey soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms deep said pippin where are
you going then
to minas tirith before the seas of war surround it
oh and how far is that
leagues upon leagues answered gandalf thrice as far as the dwellings of
king théoden and they are more than a hundred miles east from
here as the messengers of mordor fly shadowfax must run a longer road which
will prove the swifter
we shall ride now till daybreak and that is some hours away then even
shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the hills: at edoras i hope sleep if
you can you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the house
of eorl and in two days thence you shall see the purple shadow of mount
mindolluin and the walls of the tower of denethor white in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never run before now
we are come to the lands where you were foaled and every stone you know run
now hope is in speed
shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud as if a trumpet had summoned him
to battle then he sprang forward fire flew from his feet night rushed over
him
as he fell slowly into sleep pippin had a strange feeling: he and gandalf
were still as stone seated upon the statue of a running horse while the world
rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind
 
 
 
well master were in a fix and no mistake said sam gamgee he stood
despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered out with puckered
eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they had fled from the company as far as they
could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the emyn muil
sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward
sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had
been hours before yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot
of hills but always they found its outward faces sheer high and impassable
frowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skirts lay livid festering
marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff bare and bleak its feet
wrapped in mist and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting
cloud a chill wind blew from the east night was gathering over the shapeless
lands before them the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown far
away to the right the anduin that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the
day was now hidden in shadow but their eyes did not look beyond the river
back to gondor to their friends to the lands of men south and east they
stared to where at the edge of the oncoming night a dark line hung like
distant mountains of motionless smoke every now and again a tiny red gleam far
away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky
what a fix  said sam thats the one place in all the lands weve ever
heard of that we dont want to see any closer and thats the one place were
trying to get to and thats just where we cant get nohow weve come the
wrong way altogether seemingly we cant get down and if we did get down wed
find all that green land a nasty bog ill warrant phew can you smell it he
sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did not move and his eyes remained
fixed staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame mordor  he
muttered under his breath if i must go there i wish i could come there quickly
and make an end  he shuddered the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour
of cold decay well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot stay
here all night fix or no fix we must find a more sheltered spot and camp once
more and perhaps another day will show us a path
or another and another and another muttered sam or maybe no day weve
come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo its my doom i think to go to that shadow yonder
so that a way will be found but will good or evil show it to me what hope we
had was in speed delay plays into the enemys hands-and here i am: delayed is
it the will of the dark tower that steers us all my choices have proved ill i
should have left the company long before and come down from the north east of
the river and of the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle plain to the
passes of mordor but now it isnt possible for you and me alone to find a way
back and the orcs are prowling on the east bank every day that passes is a
precious day lost i am tired sam i dont know what is to be done what food
have we got left
only those what dyou call em lembas mr frodo a fair supply
but they are better than naught by a long bite i never thought though when i
first set tooth in them that i should ever come to wish for a change but i do
now: a bit of plain bread and a mug - aye half a mug - of beer would go down
proper ive lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp and what use
has it been naught to make a fire with for a start and naught to cook not
even grass
they turned away and went down into a stony hollow the westering sun was
caught into clouds and night came swiftly they slept as well as they could for
the cold turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged pinnacles of
weathered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frodo asked sam as they sat stiff and
chilled munching wafers of lembas in the cold grey of early morning
no said frodo ive heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam grrr those eyes did give me a turn but perhaps weve
shaken him off at last the miserable slinker gollum ill give him gollum
in his throat if ever i get my hands on his neck
i hope youll never need to said frodo i dont know how he followed us
but it may be that hes lost us again as you say in this dry bleak land we
cant leave many footprints nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam i wish we could be rid of him for
good
so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble i wish we could get
away from these hills i hate them i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder theres
an eye in it come on weve got to get down today somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded towards evening they were
still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they heard
faint sounds behind them a stone falling or the imagined step of flapping feet
on the rock but if they halted and stood still listening they heard no more
nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the stones - yet even that
reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil had been bending gradually
northward as they struggled on along its brink there now stretched a wide
tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again by
trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff-face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming deeper and more frequent
frodo and sam were driven to their left well away from the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they had been going slowly but steadily
downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halt the ridge took a sharper bend northward
and was gashed by a deeper ravine on the further side it reared up again many
fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them cut sheer down
as if by a knife stroke they could go no further forwards and must turn now
either west or east but west would lead them only into more labour and delay
back towards the heart of the hills east would take them to the outer
precipice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to
a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed some way down they found a
few gnarled and stunted trees the first they had seen for days: twisted birch
for the most part with here and there a fir-tree many were dead and gaunt
bitten to the core by the eastern winds once in milder days there must have
been a fair thicket in the ravine but now after some fifty yards the trees
came to an end though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliffs
brink the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge of a rock-fault was
rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down when they came at last to the
end of it frodo stooped and leaned out
look he said we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has
sunk its much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge then he glanced up
at the great cliff rising up away on their left easier  he grunted well
i suppose its always easier getting down than up those as cant fly can jump
it would be a big jump still said frodo about well - he stood for a
moment measuring it with his eyes - about eighteen fathoms i should guess not
more
and thats enough  said sam ugh how i do hate looking down from a
height but lookings better than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could climb here and i think we
shall have to try see - the rock is quite different from what it was a few
miles back it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a little it
looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had shifted so that
its courses were all twisted and disordered leaving great fissures and long
slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we had better try at once its
getting dark early i think theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east was lost in a deeper blackness
that was already reaching out westwards with long arms there was a distant
mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze frodo sniffed the air and looked
up doubtfully at the sky he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened
it and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good  said sam gloomily but im going first
you  said frodo whats made you change your mind about climbing
i havent changed my mind but its only sense: put the one lowest as is
most likely to slip i dont want to come down atop of you and knock you off no
sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung his legs over the brink and
twisted round scrabbling with his toes for a foothold it is doubtful if he
ever did anything braver in cold blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass  said frodo youll kill yourself for certain
going over like that without even a look to see what to make for come back 
he took sam under the armpits and hauled him up again now wait a bit and be
patient  he said then he lay on the ground leaning out and looking down: but
the light seemed to be fading quickly although the sun had not yet set i
think we could manage this he said presently i could at any rate and you
could too if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam why you cant see to the
bottom in this light what if you comes to a place where theres nowhere to put
your feet or your hands
climb back i suppose said frodo
easy said objected sam better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo with a sudden strange vehemence i
grudge every hour every minute im going down to try it out dont you follow
till i come back or call
gripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself gently
down until when his arms were almost at full stretch his toes found a ledge
on_ e step down  he said and this ledge broadens out to the right i could
stand there without a hold ill- his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushed up from the east and
swallowed the sky there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills then came a blast of savage wind
and with it mingling with its roar there came a high shrill shriek the
hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the marish as they fled from
hobbiton and even there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their blood
out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold
blades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath sam fell flat on his
face involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and
ears he swayed slipped and slithered downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge master master  he
called master
he heard no answer he found he was shaking all over but he gathered his
breath and once again he shouted: master the wind seemed to blow his voice
back into his throat but as it passed roaring up the gully and away over the
hills a faint answering cry came to his ears:
all right all right im here but i cant see
frodo was calling with a weak voice he was not actually very far away he
had slid and not fallen and had come up with a jolt to his feet on a wider
ledge not many yards lower down fortunately the rock-face at this point leaned
well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff so that he had not
toppled over he steadied himself a little laying his face against the cold
stone feeling his heart pounding but either the darkness had grown complete
or else his eyes had lost their sight all was black about him he wondered if
he had been struck blind he took a deep breath
come back come back  he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant he said i cant see i cant find any hold i cant move yet
what can i do mr frodo what can i do  shouted sam leaning out
dangerously far why could not his master see it was dim certainly but not as
dark as all that he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed
against the cliff but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came in a blinding
sheet mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he hoped to help in that
way he could not have said
no no wait  frodo called back more strongly now i shall be better
soon i feel better already wait you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to
numbskulls youre nowt but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee: thats what the gaffer
said to me often enough it being a word of his rope
stop chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and
annoyed never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself youve got
some rope in your pocket if so out with it
yes mr frodo in my pack and all carried it hundreds of miles and id
clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down
quickly sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it there indeed at the bottom
was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of lórien he
cast an end to his master the darkness seemed to lift from frodos eyes or
else his sight was returning he could see the grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen now that he had some point in
the darkness to fix his eyes on he felt less giddy leaning his weight forward
he made the end fast round his waist and then he grasped the line with both
hands
sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from the
edge half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on the
ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falling
heavily the hobbits crawled away back into the gully but they did not find
much shelter there rills of water began to run down soon they grew to a spate
that splashed and fumed on the stones and spouted out over the cliff like the
gutters of a vast roof
i should have been half drowned down there or washed clean off said
frodo what a piece of luck you had that rope
better luck if id thought of it sooner said sam maybe you remember them
putting the ropes in the boats as we started off: in the elvish country i took
a fancy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack years ago it seems "it may
be a help in many needs" he said: haldir or one of those folk and he
spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length said frodo but i left
the company in such a hurry and confusion if only we had enough we could use it
to get down how long is your rope i wonder
sam paid it out slowly measuring it with his arms: five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would  said sam elves are wonderful folk it looks a bit thin
but its tough and soft as milk to the hand packs close too and as light as
light wonderful folk to be sure
thirty ells  said frodo considering i believe it would be enough if the
storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but dont you go doing
anything risky in the dim again mr frodo and i havent got over that shriek
on the wind yet if you have like a black rider it sounded-but one up in the
air if they can fly im thinking wed best lay up in this crack till nights
over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment longer than i need stuck up on
this edge with the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said
frodo
with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again he
looked out clear sky was growing in the east once more the skirts of the storm
were lifting ragged and wet and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought of sauron brooded for a
while thence it turned smiting the vale of anduin with hail and lightning and
casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war then lowering in the
mountains and gathering its great spires it rolled on slowly over gondor and
the skirts of rohan until far away the riders on the plain saw its black towers
moving behind the sun as they rode into the west but here over the desert and
the reeking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a few
pallid stars appeared like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent
moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep do you
know i thought for a bit that i had lost my sight from the lightning or
something else worse i could see nothing nothing at all until the grey rope
came down it seemed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam never noticed it
before though i cant remember as ive ever had it out since i first stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how are you going to use it thirty
ells or say about eighteen fathom: thats no more than your guess at the
height of the cliff
frodo thought for a while make it fast to that stump sam  he said then
i think you shall have your wish this time and go first ill lower you and you
need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give me a rest it will
help when youre down ill follow i feel quite myself again now
very well said sam heavily if it must be lets get it over  he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink then the other
end he tied about his own waist reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over
the edge a second time
it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected the rope seemed
to give him confidence though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked
down between his feet there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge and
the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space there he slipped and
swung out on the silver line but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it
was over at last his chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out
while he was still high up but there was still a good bight in frodos hands
when sam came to the bottom and called up: im down  his voice came up
clearly from below but frodo could not see him his grey elven-cloak had melted
into the twilight
frodo took rather more time to follow him he had the rope about his waist
and it was fast above and he had shortened it so that it would pull him up
before he reached the ground still he did not want to risk a fall and he had
not quite sams faith in this slender grey line he found two places all the
same where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces where there was no
hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart but at
last he too was down
well he cried weve done it weve escaped from the emyn muil and now
what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock under
foot again
but sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff ninnyhammers  he
said noodles my beautiful rope there it is tied to a stump and were at the
bottom just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve gone i thought it seemed a bit
too easy
if you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought
it down with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer or any other name your
gaffer gave you said frodo climb up and untie it and let yourself down if
you want to
sam scratched his head no i cant think how begging your pardon he
said but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact he stroked the ropes
end and shook it gently it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of
the elf-country made by galadriel herself too maybe galadriel he murmured
nodding his head mournfully he looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as
if in farewell
to the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose sam fell over
and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him frodo laughed
who tied the rope  he said a good thing it held as long as it did to think
that i trusted all my weight to your knot
sam did not laugh i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo he said
in injured tones but i do know something about rope and about knots its in
the family as you might say why my grand-dad and my uncle andy after him
him that was the gaffers eldest brother he had a rope-walk over by tighfield
many a year and i put as fast a hitch over the stump as any one could have
done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must have broken - frayed on the rock-edge i expect said
frodo
i bet it didnt  said sam in an even more injured voice he stooped and
examined the ends nor it hasnt neither not a strand
then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer he was passing the rope through his
fingers thoughtfully have it your own way mr frodo he said at last but i
think the rope came off itself - when i called he coiled it up and stowed it
lovingly in his pack
it certainly came said frodo and thats the chief thing but now weve
got to think of our next move night will be on us soon how beautiful the stars
are and the moon
they do cheer the heart dont they  said sam looking up elvish they
are somehow and the moons growing we havent seen him for a night or two in
this cloudy weather hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days i dont think well
try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of their
journey after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come the
mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff im glad weve got the
rope he said weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow he can try
his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff among a wilderness
of boulders and rough stones wet and slippery with the heavy rain the ground
still fell away sharply they had not gone very far when they came upon a great
fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet it was not wide but it
was too wide to jump across in the dim light they thought they could hear water
gurgling in its depths it curved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at any rate while darkness
lasted
we had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff i
think said sam we might find some nook there or even a cave or something
i suppose so said frodo im tired and i dont think i can scramble
among stones much longer tonight - though i grudge the delay i wish there was a
clear path in front of us: then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony slopes
frowned over by the cliff which now rose again higher and more sheer as they
went back in the end worn out they just cast themselves on the ground under
the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipice there for
some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony night while
sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off the moon now
rode high and clear its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and
drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff turning all the wide looming
darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows
well  said frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round
him you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket ill walk up and down on
sentry for a while suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the
arm whats that  he whispered look over there on the cliff
sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth ssss he said
thats what it is its that gollum snakes and adders and to think that i
thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of a climb look at him like a nasty
crawling spider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the pale
moonlight a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out maybe
its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds that no hobbit
could ever have seen or used but it looked as if it was just creeping down on
sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect-kind and it was coming
down head first as if it was smelling its way now and again it lifted its head
slowly turning it right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits caught a
glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights its eyes that blinked at the moon for
a moment and then were quickly lidded again
do you think he can see us  said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not it is hard even for
friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: i cannot see you in the shadow even at
a few paces and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here  asked sam
quietly sam  said frodo he can smell us perhaps and he can hear as
keen as elves i believe i think he has heard something now: our voices
probably we did a lot of shouting away back there and we were talking far too
loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam hes come once too often for me and im
going to have a word with him if i can i dont suppose we could give him the
slip now anyway drawing his grey hood well over his face sam crept stealthily
towards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind dont alarm him hes much more
dangerous than he looks
the black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down and perhaps
fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot crouching stone-still in the shadow
of a large boulder the hobbits watched him he seemed to have come to a
difficult passage or to be troubled about something they could hear him
snuffling and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like
a curse he lifted his head and they thought they heard him spit then he moved
on again now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautious my precious more haste less speed we musstnt rissk
our neck musst we precious no precious - gollum he lifted his head
again blinked at the moon and quickly shut his eyes we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is - sss - it spies on us precious - it hurts
our eyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer where
iss it where iss it: my precious my precious its ours it is and we wants
it the thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves where are they with my
precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were here does it  whispered sam and
whats his precious does he mean the
hsh  breathed frodo hes getting near now near enough to hear a
whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large head on its scrawny
neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening his pale eyes were
half unlidded sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitching his
eyes filled with anger and disgust were fixed on the wretched creature as he
now began to move again still whispering and hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground right above their
heads from that point there was a sheer drop for the cliff was slightly
undercut and even gollum could not find a hold of any kind he seemed to be
trying to twist round so as to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill
whistling shriek he fell as he did so he curled his legs and arms up round
him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and
the cliff foot in a couple of leaps before gollum could get up he was on top
of him but he found gollum more than he bargained for even taken like that
suddenly off his guard after a fall before sam could get a hold long legs and
arms were wound round him pinning his arms and a clinging grip soft but
horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords clammy fingers
were feeling for his throat then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder all he
could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creatures face
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had been alone but frodo sprang
up and drew sting from its sheath with his left hand he drew back gollums
head by his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcing his pale
venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he said this is sting you have seen it before once upon
a time let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string sam got up fingering his
shoulder his eyes smouldered with anger but he could not avenge himself: his
miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them hurt us precious they wont hurt us will
they nice little hobbitses we didnt mean no harm but they jumps on us like
cats on poor mices they did precious and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very nice if theyll be nice to us wont we yes
yess
well whats to be done with it  said sam tie it up so as it cant come
sneaking after us no more i say
but that would kill us kill us whimpered gollum cruel little hobbitses
tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us gollum gollum
sobs welled up in his gobbling throat
no said frodo if we kill him we must kill him outright but we cant do
that not as things are poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh hasnt he  said sam rubbing his shoulder anyway he meant to and
he means to ill warrant throttle us in our sleep thats his plan
i daresay said frodo but what he means to do is another matter he
paused for a while in thought gollum lay still but stopped whimpering sam
stood glowering over him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly but far off voices out
of the past:
what a pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature when he had a chance
pity it was pity that stayed his hand pity and mercy: not to strike
without need
i do not feel any pity for gollum he deserves death
deserves death i daresay he does many that live deserve death and some die
that deserve life can you give that to them then be not too eager to deal out
death in the name of justice fearing for your own safety even the wise cannot
see all ends
very well he answered aloud lowering his sword but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature for now that i see him i do
pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be speaking to some one who was not
there gollum lifted his head
yess wretched we are precious he whined misery misery hobbits wont
kill us nice hobbits
no we wont said frodo but we wont let you go either youre full of
wickedness and mischief gollum you will have to come with us thats all
while we keep an eye on you but you must help us if you can one good turn
deserves another
yess yes indeed said gollum sitting up nice hobbits we will come with
them find them safe paths in the dark yes we will and where are they going in
these cold hard lands we wonders yes we wonders  he looked up at them and a
faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking
eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his teeth but he seemed to sense that there
was something odd about his masters mood and that the matter was beyond
argument all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough sméagol
he said quietly and sternly we are going to mordor of course and you know
the way there i believe
ach sss  said gollum covering his ears with his hands as if such
frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him we guessed yes we
guessed he whispered and we didnt want them to go did we no precious
not the nice hobbits ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and pits
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses nice hobbits mustnt go to - sss -
those places
so you have been there  frodo insisted and youre being drawn back
there arent you
yess yess no  shrieked gollum once by accident it was wasnt it
precious yes by accident but we wont go back no no then suddenly his
voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat and spoke but not to
them leave me alone gollum you hurt me o my poor hands gollum
i we i dont want to come back i cant find it i am tired i we cant find
it gollum gollum no nowhere theyre always awake dwarves
men and elves terrible elves with bright eyes i cant find it ach  he got
up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the
east we wont  he cried not for you then he collapsed again gollum
gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground dont look at us go
away go to sleep
he will not go away or go to sleep at your command sméagol said
frodo but if you really wish to be free of him again then you must help me
and that i fear means finding us a path towards him but you need not go all the
way not beyond the gates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids hes over there
he cackled always there orcs will take you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river dont ask sméagol poor poor sméagol
he went away long ago they took his precious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
get up  said frodo
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff
now  said frodo can you find a path easier by day or by night were
tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined not under the white
face not yet it will go behind the hills soon yess rest a bit first nice
hobbits
then sit down said frodo and dont move
the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side with their
backs to the stony wall resting their legs there was no need for any
arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment slowly the
moon went by shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark before them
the stars grew thick and bright in the sky above no one stirred gollum sat
with his legs drawn up knees under chin flat hands and feet splayed on the
ground his eyes closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening
frodo looked across at sam their eyes met and they understood they relaxed
leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to soon the sound
of their soft breathing could be heard gollums hands twitched a little hardly
perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right and first one eye and then
the other opened a slit the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the ground with a
jump like a grasshopper or a frog gollum bounded forward into the darkness but
that was just what frodo and sam had expected sam was on him before he had gone
two paces after his spring frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful again sam he said
sam got out the rope and where were you off to in the cold hard lands mr
gollum he growled we wonders aye we wonders to find some of your
orc-friends i warrant you nasty treacherous creature its round your neck
this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks he did not answer sam but gave
him a swift venomous look
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo we want him to
walk so its no good tying his legs-or his arms he seems to use them nearly as
much tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gollum while sam tied the knot the result surprised them
both gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to hear he
writhed and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope he kept on
screaming
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in pain but it could not be
from the knot he examined it and found that it was not too tight indeed hardly
tight enough sam was gentler than his words whats the matter with you  he
said if you will try to run away you must be tied but we dont wish to hurt
you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum it freezes it bites elves
twisted it curse them nasty cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of
course it is precious we guessed they were cruel hobbits they visits elves
fierce elves with bright eyes take it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said frodo not unless - he paused a
moment in thought - not unless there is any promise you can make that i can
trust
we will swear to do what he wants yes yess said gollum still twisting
and grabbling at his ankle it hurts us
swear  said frodo
sméagol said gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide and
staring at frodo with a strange light sméagol will swear on the
precious
frodo drew himself up and again sam was startled by his words and his stern
voice on the precious how dare you  he said think
one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that sméagol it will hold
you but it is more treacherous than you are it may twist your words beware
gollum cowered on the precious on the precious  he repeated
and what would you swear  asked frodo
to be very very good said gollum then crawling
to frodos feet he grovelled before him whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over
him as if the words shook his very bones with fear sméagol will swear
never never to let him have it never sméagol will save it but he
must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo looking down at him
with stern pity all you wish is to see it and touch it if you can though you
know it would drive you mad not on it swear by it if you will for you know
where it is yes you know sméagol it is before you
for a moment it appeared to sam that his master had grown and gollum had
shrunk: a tall stern shadow a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey cloud
and at his feet a little whining dog yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien: they could reach one anothers minds gollum raised himself and began
pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
down down  said frodo now speak your promise
we promises yes i promise said gollum i will serve the master of the
precious good master good sméagol gollum
gollum suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
reluctantly sam obeyed at once gollum got up and began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has patted it from that moment a change which
lasted for some time came over him he spoke with less hissing and whining and
he spoke to his companions direct not to his precious self he would cringe and
flinch if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement and he avoided the
touch of their elven-cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxious
to please he would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest was made or
even if frodo spoke kindly to him and weep if frodo rebuked him sam said
little to him of any sort he suspected him more
deeply than ever and if possible liked the new gollum the sméagol less
than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you he said now for it
the moons gone and the nights going wed better start
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about off we go theres only one way
across between the north-end and the south-end i found it i did orcs dont
use it orcs dont know it orcs dont cross the marshes they go round for
miles and miles very lucky you came this way very
lucky you found sméagol yes follow sméagol
he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly like a dog inviting
them for a walk wait a bit gollum cried sam not too far ahead now im
going to be at your tail and ive got the rope handy
no no  said gollum sméagol promised
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off gollum led them
back northward for a while along the way they had come then he slanted to the
right away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down the broken stony slopes
towards the vast fens below they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of mordor there was a black
silence
 
gollum moved quickly with his head and neck thrust forward often using his
hands as well as his feet frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep up with
him but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping and if they fell
behind he would turn and wait for them after a time he brought them to the
brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before but they were now further
from the hills
here it is he cried there is a way down inside yes now we follows it -
out out away over there he pointed south and east towards the marshes the
reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and foul even in the cool night air

gollum cast up and down along the brink and at length he called to them
here we can get down here sméagol went this way once: i went this
way hiding from orcs
he led the way and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom it
was not difficult for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep
and about a dozen across there was running water at the bottom: it was in fact
the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to
feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond gollum turned to the right southward
more or less and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream he
seemed greatly delighted to feel the water and chuckled to himself sometimes
even croaking in a sort of song
the cold hard lands

they bites our hands

they gnaws our feet

the rocks and stones

are like old bones

all bare of meat

but stream and pool

is wet and cool:

so nice for feet

and now we wish -
ha ha what does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits well
tell you he croaked he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it a glint
came into his eyes and sam catching the gleam in the darkness thought it far
from pleasant
alive without breath

as cold as death

never thirsting ever drinking

clad in mail never clinking

drowns on dry land

thinks an island

is a mountain

thinks a fountain

is a puff of air

so sleek so fair

what a joy to meet

we only wish

to catch a fish

so juicy-sweet
these words only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that had been
troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was going to
adopt gollum as a guide: the problem of food it did not occur to him that his
master might also have thought of it hut he supposed gollum had indeed how had
gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering not too well thought sam
he looks fair famished not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there
aint no fish ill wager - supposing as he could catch us napping well he
wont: not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time or so it
seemed to the tired feet of frodo and sam the gully turned eastward and as
they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower at last the sky above
grew faint with the first grey of morning gollum had shown no signs of tiring
but now he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as if day was something
that might overhear him and spring on him sméagol will stay here: i
will stay here and the yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said frodo but we will stay here: we
are too tired to go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow
face said gollum it shows you up nice sensible hobbits stay with sméagol
orcs and nasty things are about they can see a long way stay and hide with me

the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the
gully it was not much more than a tall mans height now and at its base there
were wide flat shelves of dry stone the water ran in a channel on the other
side frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs gollum paddled
and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo are you hungry sméagol we
have very little to share but we will spare you what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in gollums pale eyes
and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face for a
moment he relapsed into his old gollum-manner we are famisshed yes famisshed
we are precious he said what is it they eats have they nice fisshes  his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo we have only got this - he held up a
wafer of lembas - and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum drink it drink it while we can but
what is it theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty 
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its
leaf-wrapping gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of
disgust came over it and a hint of his old malice
sméagol smells it  he said leaves out of the elf-country gah they
stinks he climbed in those trees and he couldnt wash the smell off his hands
my nice hands dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas
and nibbled it he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
ach no  he spluttered you try to choke poor sméagol dust and
ashes he cant eat that he must starve but sméagol doesnt mind nice
hobbits sméagol has promised he will starve he cant eat hobbits
food he will starve poor thin sméagol 
im sorry said frodo but i cant help you im afraid i think this food
would do you good if you would try but perhaps you cant even try not yet
anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in silence sam thought that it
tasted far better somehow than it had for a good while: gollums behaviour had
made him attend to its flavour again but he did not feel comfortable gollum
watched every morsel from hand to mouth like an expectant dog by a diners
chair only when they had finished and were preparing to rest was he apparently
convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in then he went
and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little
look here  sam whispered to frodo not too softly: he did not
really care whether gollum heard him or not weve got to get some sleep but
not both together with that hungry villain nigh promise or no promise sméagol
or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant you go to sleep
mr frodo and ill call you when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same as before while hes loose
perhaps youre right sam said frodo speaking openly there is a
change in him but just what kind of a change and how deep im not sure yet
seriously though i dont think there is any need for fear - at present still
watch if you wish give me about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept
almost as soon as he had spoken the words gollum seemed no longer to have any
fears he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned presently his
breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth hut he lay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop off himself if he sat listening to
his two companions breathing sam got up and gently prodded gollum his hands
uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement sam bent down and said fissh
close to his ear but there was no response not even a catch in gollums
breathing
sam scratched his head must really be asleep he muttered and if i was
like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again he restrained the thoughts of his
sword and the rope that sprang to his mind and went and sat down by his master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not lighter but darker than when they
had breakfasted sam leapt to his feet not least from his own feeling of vigour
and hunger he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nine
hours at least frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen various reproachful names for himself came to sams
mind drawn from the gaffers large paternal word-hoard then it also occurred
to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to
guard against they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch  he said half remorsefully now i wonder where hes got to 
not far not far  said a voice above him he looked up and saw the shape
of gollums large head and ears against the evening sky
here what are you doing  cried sam his suspicions coming back as soon as
he saw that shape
sméagol is hungry said gollum be back soon
come back now shouted sam hi come back but gollum had vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes hullo
he said anything wrong whats the time
i dunno said sam after sundown i reckon and hes gone off says hes
hungry
dont worry said frodo theres no help for it but hell come back
youll see the promise will hold yet a while and he wont leave his precious
anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours
with gollum and a very hungry gollum too loose beside them dont think of
any of your gaffers hard names he said you were worn out and it has turned
out well: we are now both rested and we have a hard road ahead the worst road
of all
about the food said sam how longs it going to take us to do this job
and when its done what are we going to do then this waybread keeps you on
your legs in a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper as
you might say: not to my feeling anyhow meaning no disrespect to them as made
it but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow i reckon
weve got enough to last say three weeks or so and that with a tight belt and
a light tooth mind you weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to - to finish said frodo we were
miserably delayed in the hills but samwise gamgee my dear hobbit - indeed sam
my dearest hobbit friend of friends - i do not think we need give thought to
what comes after that to do the job as you put it - what hope is there
that we ever shall and if we do who knows what will come of that if the one
goes into the fire and we are at hand i ask you sam are we ever likely to
need bread again i think not if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to mount
doom that is all we can do more than i can i begin to feel
sam nodded silently he took his masters hand and bent over it he did not
kiss it though his tears fell on it then he turned away drew his sleeve over
his nose and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and saying between
the efforts: wheres that dratted creature
it was actually not long before gollum returned but he came so quietly that
they did not hear him till he stood before them his fingers and face were
soiled with black mud he was still chewing and slavering what he was chewing
they did not ask or like to think
worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes thought sam brr the
nasty creature the poor wretch 
gollum said nothing to them until he had drunk
deeply and washed himself in the stream then he came up to them licking his
lips better now he said are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they
sleep beautifully trust sméagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last as they went
on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual its
bottom was less stony and more earthy and slowly its sides dwindled to mere
banks it began to wind and wander that night drew to its end but clouds were
now over moon and star and they knew of the coming of day only by the slow
spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water-course the banks became
moss-grown mounds over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled and
fell down into a brown bog and was lost dry reeds hissed and rattled though
they could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay stretching away
southward and eastward into the dim half-light mists curled and smoked from
dark and noisome pools the reek of them hung stifling in the still air far
away now almost due south the mountain-walls of mordor loomed like a black
bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gollum they did now know and
could not guess in that misty light that they were in fact only just within the
northern borders of the marshes the main expanse of which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lands with some delay have retraced their
steps a little and then turning east have come round over hard roads to the
bare plain of dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of
mordor not that there was great hope in such a course on that
stony plain there was no cover and across it ran the highways of the orcs and
the soldiers of the enemy not even the cloaks of lórien would have
concealed them there
how do we shape our course now sméagol  asked frodo must we
cross these evil-smelling fens 
no need no need at all said gollum not if hobbits want to reach the
dark mountains and go to see him very quick back a little and round a little
- his skinny arm waved north and east - and you can come on hard cold roads to
the very gates of his country lots of his people
will be there looking out for guests very pleased to take them straight to him
o yes his eye watches that way all the time it caught sméagol there
long ago gollum shuddered but sméagol has used his eyes since then
yes yes: ive used eyes and feet and nose since then l know other ways more
difficult not so quick but better if we dont want him to see follow sméagol
he can take you through the marshes through the mists nice thick mists follow
sméagol very carefully and you may go a long way quite a long
way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen morning and the marsh-reeks lay in
heavy banks no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed anxious to
continue the journey at once so after a brief rest they set out again and were
soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off from all view of the lands about
either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought they went
slowly in single file: gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow though they went he often
lagged the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really
an endless network of pools and soft mires and winding half-strangled
water-courses among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it his head on its long
neck was ever turning this way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the
time to himself sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them while he
went forward a little crouching testing the ground with fingers or toes or
merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome cold clammy winter still held sway in this
forsaken country the only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark greasy
surfaces of the sullen waters dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the
mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light increased a little and the mists lifted
growing thinner and more transparent far above the rot and vapours of the world
the sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of
dazzling foam but only a passing ghost of her could they see below bleared
pale giving no colour and no warmth but even at this faint reminder of her
presence gollum scowled and flinched he halted their journey and they rested
squatting like little hunted animals in the borders of a great brown
reed-thicket there was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces by the
faint quiver of empty seed-plumes and broken grass-blades trembling in small
air-movements that they could not feel
not a bird  said sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum nice birds  he licked his teeth no birds
here there are snakeses wormses things in the pools lots of things lots of
nasty things no birds he ended sadly sam looked at him with distaste
so passed the third day of their journey with gollum before the shadows of
evening were long in happier lands they went on again always on and on with
only brief halts these they made not so much for rest as to help gollum for
now even he had to go forward with great care and he was sometimes at a loss
for a while they had come to the very midst of the dead marshes and it was
dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line following attentively
every move that gollum made the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant
meres among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places
where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud the travellers were
light or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through
presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to
breathe when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going
queer he first saw one with the corner of his left eye a wisp of pale sheen
that faded away but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke
some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and there
they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands but neither of his
companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer whats all this gollum  he said in a
whisper these lights theyre all round us now are we trapped who are they

gollum looked up a dark water was before him and he was crawling on the
ground this way and that doubtful of the way yes they are all round us he
whispered the tricksy lights candles of corpses yes yes dont you heed
them dont look dont follow them wheres the master 
sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again he could not see him
he went some paces back into the darkness not daring to move far or to call in
more than a hoarse whisper suddenly he stumbled against frodo who was standing
lost in thought looking at the pale lights his hands hung stiff at his sides
water and slime were dripping from them
come mr frodo  said sam dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can - if
we can 
all right said frodo as if returning out of a dream im coming go on

hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot in some old root or
tussock he fell and came heavily on his hands which sank deep into sticky
ooze so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere there
was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up the lights flickered and danced and
swirled for a moment the water below him looked like some window glazed with
grimy glass through which he was peering wrenching his hands out of the bog
he sprang back with a cry there are dead things dead faces in the water he
said with horror dead faces 
gollum laughed the dead marshes yes yes: that is their names he
cackled you should not look in when the candles are lit
who are they what are they  asked sam shuddering turning to frodo who
was now behind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike voice but i have seen them too
in the pools when the candles were lit they lie in all the pools pale faces
deep deep under the dark water i saw them: grim faces and evil and noble faces
and sad many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair but all
foul all rotting all dead a fell light is in them frodo hid his eyes in his
hands i know not who they are but i thought i saw there men and elves and
orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum all dead all rotten
elves and men and orcs the dead marshes there was a great battle long ago
yes so they told him when sméagol was young when i was young before the
precious came it was a great battle tall men with long swords and terrible
elves and orcses shrieking they fought on the plain for days and months
at the black gates but the marshes have grown since then swallowed up the
graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam the dead cant be really there
is it some devilry hatched in the dark land 
who knows sméagol doesnt know answered gollum you cannot reach
them you cannot touch them we tried once yes precious i tried once but
you cannot reach them only shapes to see perhaps not to touch no precious
all dead
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again thinking that he guessed why sméagol
had tried to touch them well i dont want to see them he said never
again cant we get on and get away 
yes yes said gollum but slowly very
slowly very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light
little candles follow sméagol dont look at lights 
he crawled away to the right seeking for a path round the mere they came
close behind stooping often using their hands even as he did three precious
little gollums in a row we shall be if this goes on much longer thought sam
at last they came to the end of the black mere and they crossed it
perilously crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or falling hands-first into waters as noisome as
a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank
in one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared that he was pleased: in
some mysterious way by some blended sense of feel and smell and uncanny
memory for shapes in the dark he seemed to know just where he was again and to
be sure of his road ahead
now on we go  he said nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of
course so we are my precious all of us but we must take master away from the
wicked lights yes yes we must with these words he started off again almost
at a trot down what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds and they
stumbled after him as quickly as they could but in a little while he stopped
suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or
displeased again
what is it  growled sam misinterpreting the signs whats the need to
sniff the stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held you stink and master
stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks  answered gollum poor sméagol smells it
but good sméagol bears it helps nice master but thats no matter the
airs moving change is coming sméagol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uneasiness grew and every now and again he stood
up to his full height craning his neck eastward and southward for some time
the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him then suddenly all
three halted stiffening and listening to frodo and sam it seemed that they
heard far away a long wailing cry high and thin and cruel they shivered at
the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them and it grew
very cold as they stood straining their ears they heard a noise like a wind
coming in the distance the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
gollum would not move he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with
a rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the marshes the night
became less dark light enough for them to see or half see shapeless drifts of
fog curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them looking up
they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and then high in the south the moon
glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits but gollum
cowered down muttering curses on the white face then frodo and sam staring at
the sky breathing deeply of the fresher air saw it come: a small cloud flying
from the accursed hills a black shadow loosed from mordor a vast shape winged
and ominous it scudded across the moon and with a deadly cry went away
westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth but the shadow of
horror wheeled and returned passing lower now right above them sweeping the
fen-reek with its ghastly wings and then it was gone flying back to mordor
with the speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it the wind roared away
leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak the naked waste as far as the eye
could pierce even to the distant menace of the mountains was dappled with the
fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like children wakened from an evil
dream to find the familiar night still over the world but gollum lay on the
ground as if he had been stunned they roused him with difficulty and for some
time he would not lift his face but knelt forward on his elbows covering the
back of his head with his large flat hands
wraiths he wailed wraiths on wings the precious is their master they
see everything everything nothing can hide from them curse the white face
and they tell him everything he sees he knows ach gollum gollum
gollum  it was not until the moon had sunk westering far beyond tol
brandir that he would get up or make a move
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again he was
more fawning and would-be friendly but sam surprised some strange looks in his
eyes at times especially towards frodo and he went back more and more into his
old manner of speaking and sam had another growing anxiety frodo seemed to be
weary weary to the point of exhaustion he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke
at all and he did not complain but he walked like one who carries a load the
weight of which is ever increasing and he dragged along slower and slower so
that sam had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordor frodo felt the ring on
its chain about his neck grow more burdensome he was now beginning to feel it
as an actual weight dragging him earthwards but far more he was troubled by the
eye: so he called it to himself it was that more than the drag of the ring that
made him cower and stoop as he walked the eye: that horrible growing sense of a
hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud and
earth and flesh and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze naked
immovable so thin so frail and thin the veils were become that still warded
it off frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now
was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of the same sort but what went on in his
wretched heart between the pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring that
was so near and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron the
hobbits did not guess: frodo gave no thought to it sams mind was occupied
mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own
heart he put frodo in front of him now and kept a watchful eye on every
movement of his supporting him if he stumbled and trying to encourage him with
clumsy words
when day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer the
ominous mountains had already drawn the air was now clearer and colder and
though still far off the walls of mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the
edge of sight but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste the
marshes were at an end dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked
mud the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes barren and pitiless towards
the desert that lay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black stone like worms
shrinking lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could
find nothing to rest upon for two more nights they struggled on through the
weary pathless land the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and filled with
a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the road with gollum they
halted once more before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached up to
roofs of smoke and cloud out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and
broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away frodo
looked round in horror dreadful as the dead marshes had been and the arid
moors of the noman-lands more loathsome far was the country that the crawling
day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes even to the mere of dead faces
some haggard phantom of green spring would come but here neither spring nor
summer would ever come again here nothing lived not even the leprous growths
that feed on rottenness the gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling
muds sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their
entrails upon the lands about high mounds of crushed and powdered rock great
cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained stood like an obscene graveyard
in endless rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the desolation that lay before mordor: the lasting monument
to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were
made void a land defiled diseased beyond all healing - unless the great sea
should enter in and wash it with oblivion i feel sick said sam frodo did
not speak
for a while they stood there like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmare
lurks holding it off though they know that they can only come to morning
through the shadows the light broadened and hardened the gasping pits and
poisonous mounds grew hideously clear the sun was up walking among clouds and
long flags of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled the hobbits had no
welcome for that light unfriendly it seemed revealing them in their
helplessness - little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash-heaps of the
dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest for
a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag but foul
fumes leaked out of it catching their throats and choking them gollum was the
first to get up spluttering and cursing he rose and without a word or a glance
at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours frodo and sam crawled after him
until they came to a wide almost circular pit high-banked upon the west it was
cold and dead and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom in
this evil hole they cowered hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the
eye
the day passed slowly a great thirst troubled them but they drank only a
few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully which now as they looked
back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty the hobbits took it
in turn to watch at first tired as they were neither of them could sleep at
all but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud sam
dozed it was frodos turn to be on guard he lay back on the slope of the pit
but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him he looked up at the
smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out
of the past he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking until
forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling it was
evening frodo could not have called for he had
fallen asleep and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit gollum was by
him for a moment sam thought that he was trying to rouse frodo then he saw
that it was not so gollum was talking to himself sméagol was
holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it
squeak and hiss a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he
spoke
sméagol promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promised: to save our precious
not to let him have it - never but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders
i dont know i cant help it masters got it sméagol promised to
help the master
yes yes to help the master: the master of the precious but if we was
master then we could help ourselfs yes and still keep promises
but sméagol said he would be very very
good nice hobbit he took cruel rope off sméagols leg he speaks nicely
to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good good as fish sweet one but
to ourselfs not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of sméagol objected
then take it said the other and lets hold it ourselfs then we shall be
master gollum make the other hobbit the nasty suspicious hobbit make
him crawl yes gollum
but not the nice hobbit 
oh no not if it doesnt please us still hes a baggins my precious yes
a baggins a baggins stole it he found it and he said nothing nothing we
hates bagginses
no not this baggins
yes every baggins all peoples that keep the precious we must have it 
but hell see hell know hell take it from us 
he sees he knows he heard us make silly promises - against his orders
yes must take it the wraiths are searching must take it
not for him 
no sweet one see my precious: if we has it then we can escape even from
him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger
than wraiths lord sméagol gollum the great the gollum
eat fish every day three times a day fresh from the sea most precious gollum
must have it we wants it we wants it we wants it 
but theres two of them theyll wake too quick and kill us
whined sméagol in a last effort not now not yet
we wants it but - and here there was a long pause as if a new thought had
wakened not yet eh perhaps not she might help she might yes
no no not that way  wailed sméagol
yes we wants it we wants it 
each time that the second thought spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a jerk as sméagol
spoke again finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed
towards his neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching every move that
gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids to his simple mind ordinary
hunger the desire to eat hobbits had seemed the chief danger in gollum he
realized now that it was not so: gollum was feeling the terrible call of the
ring the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she
was one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings he
supposed then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone far enough and
were getting dangerous a great heaviness was in all his limbs but he roused
himself with an effort and sat up something warned him to be careful and not to
reveal that he had overheard the debate he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge
yawn
whats the time  he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth he stood up for a moment
tense and menacing and then he collapsed falling forward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank of the pit nice hobbits nice
sam  he said sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good sméagol to
watch but its evening dusk is creeping time to go
high time  thought sam and time we parted too yet it crossed his mind
to wonder if indeed gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with
them curse him i wish he was choked he muttered he stumbled down the bank
and roused his master
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed he had been dreaming the dark shadow
had passed and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease nothing
remained of it in his memory yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of
heart his burden was less heavy on him gollum welcomed him with dog-like
delight he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pawing at
frodos knees frodo smiled at him
come  he said you have guided us well and faithfully this is the last
stage bring us to the gate and then i will not ask you to go further bring us
to the gate and you may go where you wish - only not to our enemies
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened to the
gate master says yes he says so and good sméagol does what he asks o
yes but when we gets closer well see perhaps well see then it wont look
nice at all o no o no
go on with you  said sam lets get it over 
in the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their
way through the dead land they had not gone far before they felt once more the
fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape
swept over the marshes they halted cowering on the evil-smelling ground but
they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the menace passed
high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad-dûr after a
while gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time but it now
seemed more remote as if it were passing far above the clouds rushing with
terrible speed into the west gollum however was helpless with terror and was
convinced that they were being hunted that their approach was known
three times  he whimpered three times is a threat they feel us here
they feel the precious the precious is their master we cannot go any further
this way no its no use no use 
pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail it was not until frodo
commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that gollum would get up
again then at last he rose with a snarl and went before them like a beaten
dog
so they stumbled on through the weary end of the night and until the coming
of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothing
and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
 
before the next day dawned their journey to mordor was over the marshes and
the desert were behind them before them darkling against a pallid sky the
great mountains reared their threatening heads
upon the west of mordor marched the gloomy range
of ephel dúath the mountains of shadow and upon the north the broken
peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash but as these ranges
approached one another being indeed but parts of one great wall about the
mournful plains of lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of núrnen
amidmost they swung out long arms northward and between these arms there was a
deep defile this was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the entrance to the land
of the enemy high cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward
from its mouth were two sheer hills black-boned and bare upon them stood the
teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall in days long past they were built
by the men of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow of sauron and
his flight lest he should seek to return to his old realm but the strength of
gondor failed and men slept and for long years the towers stood empty then
sauron returned now the watch-towers which had fallen into decay were
repaired and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony-faced they were with dark window-holes staring north and east and west
and each window was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff the dark lord had built a
rampart of stone in it there was a single gate of iron and upon its battlement
sentinels paced unceasingly beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of orcs lurked ready at a
signal to issue forth like black ants going to war none could pass the teeth of
mordor and not feel their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew the
secret passwords that would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair even from a
distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon
the wall and the patrols before the gate they lay now peering over the edge of
a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of
the northmost buttress of ephel dúath winging the heavy air in a
straight flight a crow maybe would have flown but a furlong from their
hiding-place to the black summit of the nearer tower a faint smoke curled above
it as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from the
watch-towers they blared and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the
hills came answering calls and further still
remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty
horns and drums of barad-dûr another dreadful day of fear and toil had
come to mordor and the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep
halls and the day-guards evil-eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are  said sam heres the gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get my word but the gaffer would
have a thing or two to say if he saw me now often said id come to a bad end
if i didnt watch my step he did but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old
fellow again hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam: mores the
pity he could go on telling me as long as hed got breath if only i could see
his old face again but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking "what way do we go now" we cant go
no further-unless we want to ask the orcs for a lift
no no  said gollum no use we cant go further sméagol said so
he said: well go to the gate and then well see and we do see o yes my
precious we do see sméagol knew hobbits could not go this way o yes
sméagol knew 
then what the plague did you bring us here for  said sam not feeling in
the mood to be just or reasonable
master said so master says: bring us to the gate so good sméagol
does so master said so wise master
i did said frodo his face was grim and set but resolute he was filthy
haggard and pinched with weariness but he cowered no longer and his eyes were
clear i said so because i purpose to enter mordor and i know no other way
therefore i shall go this way i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master  wailed gollum pawing at him and seeming in great
distress no use that way no use dont take the precious to him hell eat us
all if he gets it eat all the world keep it nice master and be kind to sméagol
dont let him have it or go away go to nice places and give it back to little
sméagol yes yes master: give it back eh sméagol will keep it
safe he will do lots of good especially to nice hobbits hobbits go home
dont go to the gate 
i am commanded to go to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said
frodo if there is only one way then i must take it what comes after must
come
sam said nothing the look on frodos face was enough for him he knew that
words of his were useless and after all he never had any real hope in the
affair from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope
as long as despair could be postponed now they were come to the bitter end but
he had stuck to his master all the way that was what he had chiefly come for
and he would still stick to him his master would not go to mordor alone sam
would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet he knelt at frodos
feet wringing his hands and squeaking not this
way master  he pleaded there is another way o yes indeed there is another
way darker more difficult to find more secret but sméagol knows it
let sméagol show you 
another way  said frodo doubtfully looking down at gollum with searching
eyes
yess yess indeed there was another
way sméagol found it lets go and see if its still there 
you have not spoken of this before
no master did not ask master did not say what he meant to do he does not
tell poor sméagol he says: sméagol take me to the gate - and
then good bye sméagol can run away and be good but now he says: i
purpose to enter mordor this way so sméagol is very afraid he does not
want to lose nice master and he promised master made him promise to save the
precious but master is going to take it to him straight to the black hand if
master will go this way so sméagol must save them both and he thinks of
another way that there was once upon a time nice master sméagol very
good always helps
sam frowned if he could have bored holes in gollum with his eyes he would
have done his mind was full of doubt to all appearances gollum was genuinely
distressed and anxious to help frodo but sam remembering the overheard debate
found it hard to believe that the long submerged sméagol
had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the
debate sams guess was that the sméagol and gollum halves or what in
his own mind he called slinker and stinker had made a truce and a
temporary alliance: neither wanted the enemy to get the ring both wished to
keep frodo from capture and under their eye as long as possible - at any rate
as long as stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his precious whether
there really was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old villain dont know what master
means to do he thought if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put an end to
his precious for good and all thered be trouble pretty quick i bet anyhow
old stinker is so frightened of the enemy - and hes under orders of some kind
from him or was - that hed give us away rather than be caught helping us and
rather than let his precious be melted maybe at least thats my idea and i
hope the master will think it out carefully hes as wise as any but hes
soft-hearted thats what he is its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do
next
frodo did not answer gollum at once while these doubts were passing through
sams slow but shrewd mind he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith
gorgor the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a
low hill at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between
it and the outer buttresses of the mountains in the midst of the valley stood
the black foundations of the western watch-tower by morning-light the roads
that converged upon the gate of mordor could now be clearly seen pale and
dusty one winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards into the mists
that clung about the feet of ered lithui and a third that ran towards him as
it bent sharply round the tower it entered a narrow defile and passed not far
below the hollow where he stood westward to his right it turned skirting the
shoulders of the mountains and went off southwards
into the deep shadows that mantled all the western sides of ephel dúath
beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and
the great river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on
the plain it seemed as if whole armies were on the march though for the most
part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes
beyond but here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets and over
the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many companies he
remembered his vision from afar upon amon hen so few days before though now it
seemed many years ago then he knew that the hope that had for one wild moment
stirred in his heart was vain the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in
greeting this was no assault upon the dark lord by the men of gondor risen
like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long passed away these were men
of other race out of the wide eastlands gathering to the summons of their
overlord armies that had encamped before his gate by night and now marched in
to swell his mounting power as if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of
their position alone in the growing light of day so near to this vast menace
frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head and stepped down
into the dell then he turned to gollum
sméagol he said i will trust you once more lndeed it seems that
i must do so and that it is my fate to receive help from you where i
least looked for it and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil
purpose so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance at sam for
twice now we have been in your power and you have done no harm to us nor have
you tried to take from me what you once sought may the third time prove the
best but i warn you sméagol you are in danger
yes yes master  said gollum dreadful
danger sméagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run away he
must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo i mean a danger
to yourself alone you swore a promise by what you call the precious remember
that it will hold you to it but it will seek a way to twist it to your own
undoing already you are being twisted you revealed yourself to me just now
foolishly give it back to sméagol
you said do not say that again do not let that thought grow in you
you will never get it back but the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end
you will never get it back in the last need sméagol i should put on
the precious and the precious mastered you long ago if i wearing it were to
command you you would obey even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast
yourself into the fire and such would be my command so have a care sméagol
sam looked at his master with approval but also with surprise: there was a
look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before it had
always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a
high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness of course he also
firmly held the incompatible belief that mr frodo was the wisest person in the
world with the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf gollum in
his own way and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much briefer may
have _made a similar mistake confusing kindness and blindness at any rate this
speech abashed and terrified him he grovelled on the ground and could speak no
clear words but nice master
frodo waited patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly come
now gollum or sméagol if you wish tell me of this other way and show
me if you can what hope there is in it enough to justify me in turning aside
from my plain path i am in haste
but gollum was in a pitiable state and frodos threat had quite unnerved
him it was not easy to get any clear account out of him amid
his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled
on the floor and begged them both to be kind to poor little sméagol
after a while he grew a little calmer and frodo gathered bit by bit that if a
traveller followed the road that turned west of ephel dúath he would
come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees on the right a road went
down to osgiliath and the bridges of the anduin in the middle the road went on
southwards
on on on said gollum we never went that way but they say it goes a
hundred leagues until you can see the great water that is never still there
are lots of fishes there and big birds eat fishes: nice birds: but we never
went there alas no we never had a chance and further still there are more
lands they say but the yellow face is very hot there and there are seldom any
clouds and the men are fierce and have dark faces we do not want to see that
land
no  said frodo but do not wander from your road what of the third
turning 
o yes o yes there is a third way said gollum that is the road to the
left at once it begins to climb up up winding and climbing back towards the
tall shadows when it turns round the black rock youll see it suddenly youll
see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it what will you see 
the old fortress very old very horrible now we used to hear tales from
the south when sméagol was young long ago o yes we used to tell lots
of tales in the evening sitting by the banks of the great river in the
willow-lands when the river was younger too gollum gollum he
began to weep and mutter the hobbits waited patiently
tales out of the south gollum went on again about the tall men with the
shining eyes and their houses like hills of stone and the silver crown of
their king and his white tree: wonderful tales they built very tall towers and
one they raised was silver-white and in it there was a stone like the moon and
round it were great white walls o yes there were many tales about the tower of
the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son of elendil built  said
frodo it was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he has only four on the black hand but they are enough said gollum
shuddering and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate  said frodo but what has the tower of the moon to
do with us 
well master there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the white
houses and the wall but not nice now not beautiful he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible place now travellers shiver when they see it they creep
out of sight they avoid its shadow but master will have to go that way that
is the only other way for the mountains are lower there and the old road goes
up and up until it reaches a dark pass at the top and then it goes down down
again - to gorgoroth his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will that help us  asked sam surely the enemy knows all about
his own mountains and that road will be guarded as close as this the tower
isnt empty is it 
o no not empty  whispered gollum it seems empty but it isnt o no
very dreadful things live there orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse
things live there too the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and
passes the gate nothing moves on the road that they dont know about the
things inside know: the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that we should go another long
march south to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one when we get
there if we ever do 
no no indeed said gollum hobbits must see must try to understand he
does not expect attack that way his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than to others he cant see everything all at once not yet you
see he has conquered all the country west of the shadowy mountains down to the
river and he holds the bridges now he thinks no one can come to the moontower
without fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of boats which they
cannot hide and he will know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes doing and thinking said sam have
you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing with orcs 
not nice hobbit not sensible said gollum
giving sam an angry glance and turning to frodo sméagol has talked to
orcs yes of course before he met master and to many peoples: he has walked
very far and what he says now many peoples are saying its here in the north that
the big danger is for him and for us he will come out of the black gate one
day one day soon that is the only way big armies can come but away down west
he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so  said sam not to be put off and so we are to walk up and knock
at their gate and ask if were on the right road for mordor or are they too
silent to answer its not sense we might as well do it here and save
ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum it isnt funny o no not
amusing its nut sense to try and get into mordor at all but if master says i
must go or i will go then he must try
some way but he must not go to the terrible city o no of course not that is
where sméagol helps nice sméagol though no one tells him what it
is all about sméagol helps again he found it he knows it
what did you find  asked frodo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again a little path
leading up into the mountains: and then a stair a
narrow stair o yes very long and narrow and then more stairs and then - his
voice sank even lower - a tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass it was that way that sméagol got out
of the darkness but it was years ago the path may have vanished now
but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound of it at all said sam sounds too easy at any rate
in the telling if that path is still there itll be guarded too wasnt it
guarded gollum  as he said this he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam
in gollums eye gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded  asked frodo sternly and did you escape
out of the darkness sméagol were you not rather permitted to depart
upon an errand that at least is w hat aragorn thought who found you by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie  hissed gollum and an evil light came into his eyes at the
naming of aragorn he lied on me yes he did i did escape all by my poor
self indeed i was told to seek for the precious and i have searched and
searched of course i have but not for the black one the precious was ours it
was mine i tell you i did escape
frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter gollum was for once not so
far from the truth as might be suspected that he had somehow found a way out of
mordor and at least believed that it was by his own cunning for one thing he
noted that gollum used i and that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare
appearances that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment
on top but even if gollum could be trusted on this point frodo did not forget
the wiles of the enemy the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal
back
i ask you again he said: is not this secret way guarded 
but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood he had all the
injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth or part of
it he did not answer
is it not guarded  frodo repeated
yes yes perhaps no safe places in this country said gollum sulkily no
safe places but master must try it or go home  no other way they could not
get him to say more the name of the perilous place and the high pass he could
not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadful rumour aragorn could perhaps
have told them that name and its significance: gandalf would have warned them
but they were alone and aragorn was far away and gandalf stood amid the ruin
of isengard and strove with saruman delayed by treason yet even as he spoke
his last words to saruman and the palantír
crashed in fire upon the steps of orthanc his thought was ever upon frodo and
samwise over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity
maybe frodo felt it not knowing it as he had upon amon hen even though he
believed that gandalf was gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent his head bowed striving to
recall all that gandalf had said to him but for this choice he could recall no
counsel indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon too soon
while the dark land was still very far away how
they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said perhaps he could not say
into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into dol guldur he had once
ventured but into mordor to the mountain of fire and to barad-dûr since
the dark lord rose in power again had he ever journeyed there frodo did
not think so and here he was a little halfling from the shire a simple hobbit
of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where the great ones could not
go or dared not go it was an evil fate but he had taken it on himself in his
own sitting-room in the far-off spring of another year so remote now that it
was like a chapter in a story of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom this was an evil choice which way should he choose
and if both led to terror and death what good lay in choice
the day drew on a deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where they
lay so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could be felt
as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world about them
above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke but it seemed high
and far away as if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits
sitting there under the weight of doom silent µ not moving shrouded in
their thin grey cloaks for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum a
tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of
some child of men its ragged garment still clinging to it its long arms and
legs almost bone-white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed over his knees but sam leaned back with hands behind
his head staring out of his hood at the empty sky at least for a long while it
was empty then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird-like figure wheel into
the circle of his sight and hover and then wheel away again two more
followed and then a fourth they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of pinion flying at a great
height he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering the same warning fear
was on him as he had felt in the presence of the black riders the helpless
horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon though
now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote but menace
it was frodo felt it too his thought was broken he stirred and shivered but
he did not look up gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider the
winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath the riders are about again up in the air he said
in a hoarse whisper i saw them do you think they could see us they were very
high up and if they are black riders same as before then they cant see much
by daylight can they 
no perhaps not said frodo but their steeds could see and these winged
creatures that they ride on now they can probably see more than any other
creature they are like great carrion birds they are looking for something: the
enemy is on the watch i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken for some
time they had been cut off from the world as if in an invisible island now
they were laid bare again peril had returned but still frodo did not speak to
gollum or make his choice his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory at last he stirred and stood up and
it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide but hark he said what
is that
a new fear was upon them they heard singing and hoarse shouting at first it
seemed a long way off but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them it leaped
into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and had sent armed
soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of
sauron they crouched listening the voices and the clink of weapons and
harness were very close frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their
sheaths flight was impossible
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow very
cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he could peer over it between
two broken points of stone he remained there without moving for some time
making no sound presently the voices began to recede again and then they
slowly faded away far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon then
quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low voice dark faces we have not
seen men like these before no sméagol has not they are fierce they
have black eyes and long black hair and gold rings in their ears yes
lots of beautiful gold and some have red paint on their cheeks and red cloaks
and their flags are red and the tips of their spears and they have round
shields yellow and black with big spikes not nice very cruel wicked men they
look almost as bad as orcs and much bigger sméagol
thinks they have come out of the south beyond the great rivers end: they came
up that road they have passed on to the black gate but more may follow always
more people coming to mordor one day all the peoples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his fear in his eagerness
for news of strange places
no no oliphaunts what are oliphaunts  said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behind his back as he always did when
speaking poetry and began:
grey as a mouse

big as a house

nose like a snake

i make the earth shake

as i tramp through the grass

trees crack as i pass

with horns in my mouth

i walk in the south

flapping big ears

beyond count of years

i stump round and round

never lie on the ground

not even to die

oliphaunt am i

biggest of all

huge old and tall

if ever youd met me

you wouldnt forget me

if you never do

you wont think im true

but old oliphaunt am i

and i never lie
that said sam when he had finished reciting thats a rhyme we have in
the shire nonsense maybe and maybe not but we have our tales too and news
out of the south you know in the old days hobbits used to go on their travels
now and again not that many ever came back and not that all they said was
believed: news from bree and not sure as shiretalk as the
sayings go but ive heard tales of the big folk down away in the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride on oliphaunts tis said when
they fight they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all and
the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another so when you said "men
out of the south all in red and gold" i said "were there any
oliphaunts " for if there was i was going to take a look risk or no but
now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt maybe there aint no such a
beast he sighed
no no oliphaunts said gollum again sméagol has not heard of
them he does not want to see them he does not want them to be sméagol
wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer sméagol wants master
to go nice master wont he come with sméagol 
frodo stood up he had laughed in the midst of all his cares when sam trotted
out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt and the
laugh had released him from hesitation i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts
with gandalf on a white one at their head he said then wed break a way into
this evil land perhaps but weve not just our own tired legs thats all
well sméagol the third turn may turn the best i will come with
you
good master wise master nice master cried gollum in delight patting
frodos knees good master then rest now nice hobbits under the shadow of
the stones close under the stones rest and lie quiet till the yellow face
goes away then we can go quickly soft and quick as shadows we must be
 
for the few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting into the
shade as the sun moved until at last the shadow of the western rim of their
dell grew long and darkness filled all the hollow then they ate a little and
drank sparingly gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lips good water runs down in streams
to the great river nice water in the lands we are going to sméagol will
get food there too perhaps hes very hungry yes gollum he
set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green light came
into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set out creeping over the westward rim
of the dell and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of
the road: the moon was now three nights from the full but it did not climb over
the mountains until nearly midnight and the early night was very dark a single
red light burned high up in the towers of the teeth but otherwise no sign could
be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled stumbling
through a barren stony country they did not dare to take the road but they
kept it on their left following its line as well as they could at a little
distance at last when night was growing old and they were already weary for
they had taken only one short rest the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and
then vanished: they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains
and were heading southwards
with hearts strangely lightened they now rested again but not for long they
were not going quick enough for gollum by his reckoning it was nearly thirty
leagues from the morannon to the cross-roads above osgiliath and he hoped to
cover that distance in four journeys so soon they struggled on once more until
the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude they had then walked
almost eight leagues and the hobbits could not have gone any further even if
they had dared
the growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up ominously on their left but near at hand they
could see the southward road now bearing away from the black roots of the hills
and slanting westwards beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like
dark clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown with ling and
broom and cornel and other shrubs that they did not know here and there they
saw knots of tall pine-trees the hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in
spite of weariness: the air was fresh and fragrant and it reminded them of the
uplands of the northfarthing far away it seemed good to be reprieved to walk
in a land that had only been for a few years under the dominion of the dark lord
and was not yet fallen wholly into decay but they did not forget their danger
nor the black gate that was still all too near hidden though it was behind the
gloomy heights they looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
the day passed uneasily they lay deep in the heather and counted out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change for they were still under the
shadows of the ephel dúath and the sun was veiled frodo slept at times
deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum or too tired to trouble about him
but sam found it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum was
plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams hunger
perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good
homely meal something hot out of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night they
started out again in a little while gollum led them down on to the southward
road and after that they went on more quickly though the danger was greater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead or
following them from behind but the night passed and they heard no sound of
walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps thirty miles
below the morannon it had been newly repaired but as it went south the wild
encroached upon it the handiwork of men of old could still be seen in its
straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way through
hillside slopes or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry but at last all signs of stonework faded save for a broken pillar here
and there peering out of bushes at the side or old paving-stones still lurking
amid weeds and moss heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung
the banks or sprawled out over the surface it dwindled at last to a country
cart-road little used but it did not wind: it held on its own sure course and
guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into the northern marches of that land that men once called
ithilien a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams the night
became fine under star and round moon and it seemed to the hobbits that the
fragrance of the air grew as they went forward and from the blowing and
muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticed it too and did not relish it at
the first signs of day they halted again they had come to the end of a long
cutting deep and sheer-sided in the middle by which the road clove its way
through a stony ridge now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and they saw that the mountains were now much
further off receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down into dim hazes far
below all about them were small woods of resinous trees fir and cedar and
cypress and other kinds unknown in the shire with wide glades among them and
everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs the long
journey from rivendell had brought them far south of their own land but not
until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of
clime here spring was already busy about them: fronds pierced moss and mould
larches were green-fingered small flowers were opening in the turf birds were
singing ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled
dryad loveliness
south and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of anduin shielded
from the east by the ephel dúath and yet not under the
mountain-shadow protected from the north by the emyn muil open to the southern
airs and the moist winds from the sea far away many great trees grew there
planted long ago falling into untended age amid a riot of careless descendants
and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of olive
and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles and thymes that grew in bushes
or with their woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones
sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or pale green and
marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys and many herbs of forms and scents beyond
the garden-lore of sam the grots and rocky walls were already starred with
saxifrages and stonecrops primeroles and anemones were awake in the
filbert-brakes and asphodel and many lily-flowers nodded their half-opened
heads in the grass: deep green grass beside the pools where falling streams
halted in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill as they
walked brushing their way through bush and herb sweet odours rose about them
gollum coughed and retched but the hobbits breathed deep and suddenly sam
laughed for hearts ease not for jest they followed a stream that went quickly
down before them presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow
dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin the carven rim of
which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles iris-swords stood
in ranks about it and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-rippling
surface but it was deep and fresh and spilled ever softly out over a stony lip
at the far end
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling freshet
then they sought for a resting-place and a hiding-place: for this land
fair-seeming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy they had not
come very far from the road and yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made by the orcs and other foul
servants of the dark lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn down
wantonly and left to die with evil runes or the fell sign of the eye cut in
rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake smelling and touching the
unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful for the moment of mordor was reminded
suddenly of their ever-present peril he stumbled on a ring still scorched by
fire and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and broken bones and
skulls the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine and trailing
clematis was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and
slaughter but it was not ancient he hurried back to his companions but he
said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by
gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said not lower down higher up for
me
a little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last years
fern beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank
that was crowned with old cedars here they decided to rest and pass the day
which already promised to be bright and warm a good day for strolling on their
way along the groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun the
sunlight there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch
and other evil eyes were abroad: sauron had many servants gollum in any case
would not move under the yellow face soon it would look over the dark
ridges of the ephel dúath and he would faint and cower in the light and
heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched now that the
despair of the impassable gate was behind him he did not feel so inclined as
his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their
errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the elves for
worse times ahead six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had
only a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the fire in that time well be lucky at this rate  he
thought and we might be wanting to get back we might 
besides at the end of a long night-march and after bathing and drinking he
felt even more hungry than usual a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted an idea struck him and he
turned to gollum gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own and he was
crawling away on all fours through the fern
hi gollum  said sam where are you going hunting well see here old
noser you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change myself your
new mottos always ready to help could you find anything fit for a
hungry hobbit 
yes perhaps yes said gollum sméagol always helps if
they asks - if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask and if that isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappeared he was away some time and frodo after a few mouthfuls of
lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep sam looked at
him the early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the
trees but he saw his masters face very clearly and his hands too lying at
rest on the ground beside him he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wound then as he had kept watch
sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within but
now the light was even clearer and stronger frodos face was peaceful the
marks of fear and care had left it but it looked old old and beautiful as if
the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had
before been hidden though the identity of the face was not changed not that
sam gamgee put it that way to himself he shook his head as if finding words
useless and murmured: i love him hes like that and sometimes it shines
through somehow but i love him whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder looking at frodo he
shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound sam came to him a moment later
and found him chewing something and muttering to himself on the ground beside
him lay two small rabbits which he was beginning to eye greedily
sméagol always helps he said he has brought rabbits nice
rabbits but master has gone to sleep and perhaps sam wants to sleep doesnt
want rabbits now sméagol tries to help but he cant catch things all in
a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbit at all and said so at least not to
cooked rabbit all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to learn the art
before their letters which many never reach: but sam was a good cook even by
hobbit reckoning and he had done a good deal of the camp-cooking on their
travels when there was a chance he still hopefully carried some of his gear in
his pack: a small tinder-box two small shallow pans the smaller fitting into
the larger inside them a wooden spoon a short two-pronged fork and some
skewers were stowed and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a
dwindling treasure some salt but he needed a fire and other things besides
he thought for a bit while he took out his knife cleaned and whetted it and
began to dress the rabbits he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even
for a few minutes
now gollum he said ive another job for you go and fill these pans
with water and bring em back 
sméagol will fetch water yes said gollum but what does the
hobbit want all that water for he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam if you cant guess youll soon find out and
the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn dont you damage one of
my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo he was still sleeping
quietly but sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands too
thin and drawn he is he muttered not right for a hobbit if i can get these
coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern and then scrambled up the bank
collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supply he cut out some turves at the foot of the bank
just outside the fern-brake and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going it made
little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent he was just stooping over his
fire shielding it and building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned
carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw what sam was doing he gave a
thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry ach sss -
no he cried no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum fire fire its
dangerous yes it is it burns it kills and it will bring enemies yes it
will
i dont think so said sam dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother but if it does it does im going to risk it
anyhow im going to stew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay spoil beautiful meat sméagol
saved for you poor hungry sméagol what for what for silly hobbit
they are young they are tender they are nice eat them eat them he clawed
at the nearest rabbit already skinned and lying by the fire
now now  said sam each to his own fashion our bread chokes you and
raw coney chokes me if you give me a coney the coneys mine see to cook if
i have a mind and i have you neednt watch me go and catch another and eat it
as you fancy - somewhere private and out o my sight then you wont see the
fire and i shant see you and well both be the happier ill see the fire
dont smoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into the fern sam busied himself with
his pans what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himself is some herbs
and roots especially taters - not to mention bread herbs we can manage
seemingly
gollum he called softly third time pays for all i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his looks were neither helpful nor
friendly a few bay-leaves some thyme and sage will do - before the water
boils said sam
no  said gollum sméagol is not pleased and sméagol
doesnt like smelly leaves he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not
till hes starving or very sick poor sméagol 
sméagolll get into real true hot water when this water boils if he
dont do as hes asked growled sam samll put his head in it yes precious
and id make him look for turnips and carrots and taters too if it was
the time o the year ill bet theres all sorts of good things running wild in
this country id give a lot for half a dozen taters
sméagol wont go o no precious not this time hissed gollum hes
frightened and hes very tired and this hobbits not nice not nice at all sméagol
wont grub for roots and carrotses and - taters whats taters precious eh
whats taters
po-ta-toes said sam the gaffers delight and rare good ballast for an
empty belly but you wont find any so you neednt
look but be good sméagol and fetch me the herbs and ill think better
of you whats more if you turn over a new leaf and keep it turned ill cook
you some taters one of these days i will: fried fish and chips served by s
gamgee you couldnt say no to that
yes yes we could spoiling nice fish scorching it give me fish now
and keep nassty chips 
oh youre hopeless said sam go to sleep
in the end he had to find what he wanted for himself but he did not have to
go far not out of sight of the place where his master lay still sleeping for
a while sam sat musing and tending the fire till the water boiled the daylight
grew and the air became warm the dew faded off turf and leaf soon the rabbits
cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs almost sam fell
asleep as the time went by he let them stew for close on an hour testing them
now and again with his fork and tasting the broth
when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire and crept
along to frodo frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him and then he
wakened from his dreaming: another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo sam  he said not resting is anything wrong what is the time 
about a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh on half past
eight by shire clocks maybe but nothings wrong though it aint quite what
id call right: no stock no onions no taters ive got a bit of a stew for
you and some broth mr frodo do you good youll have to sup it in your mug
or straight from the pan when its cooled a bit i havent brought no bowls
nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretched you should have been resting sam he said and
lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts but i do feel hungry hmm can i
smell it from here what have you stewed 
a present from sméagol said sam: a brace o young coneys though i
fancy gollums regretting them now but theres nought to go with them but a few
herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew from the
pans sharing the old fork and spoon they allowed themselves half a piece of
the elvish waybread each it seemed a feast
wheew gollum  sam called and whistled softly come on still time to
change your mind theres some left if you want to try stewed coney there was
no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself well finish
it said sam
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo i dont feel too sure of
him theres a good deal of stinker-the bad gollum if you understand me-in him
still and its getting stronger again not but what i think hed try to
throttle me first now we dont see eye to eye and hes not pleased with sam o
no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear as he stood
up to return he looked back up the slope at that moment he saw the sun rise
out of the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatever it was that lay ever to
the east and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey smoke plain to see as it caught the
sunlight rising from a thicket above him with a shock he realized that this
was the smoke from his little cooking-fire which he had neglected to put out
that wont do never thought it would show like that  he muttered and he
started to hurry back suddenly he halted and listened had he heard a whistle
or not or was it the call of some strange bird if it was a whistle it did not
come from frodos direction there it went again from another place sam began
to run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its outer end had kindled some
fern at the edge of the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves
smouldering hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire scattered the
ashes and laid the turves on the hole then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and what sounded like an answer  he asked a few
minutes back i hope it was only a bird but it didnt sound quite like that:
more like somebody mimicking a bird-call i thought and im afraid my bit of
fires been smoking now if ive gone and brought trouble ill never forgive
myself nor wont have a chance maybe 
hush  whispered frodo i thought i heard voices
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put them on ready for flight and
then crawled deeper into the fern there they crouched listening
there was no doubt of the voices they were speaking low and furtively but
they were near and coming nearer then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close
at hand
here here is where the smoke came from  it said twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt we shall have it like a coney in a trap then we shall
learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows  said a second voice
at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions
since flight and hiding were no longer possible frodo and sam sprang to their
feet putting back to back and whipping out their small swords
if they were astonished at what they saw their captors were even more
astonished four tall men stood there two had spears in their hands with broad
bright heads two had great bows almost of their own height and great quivers
of long green-feathered arrows all had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of
ithilien green gauntlets covered their hands and their faces were hooded and
masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen and bright at
once frodo thought of boromir for these men were like him in stature and
bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one but what have we found 
not orcs said another releasing the hilt of his sword which he had
seized when he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves  said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as it appeared the chief
among them elves do not walk in ithilien in these days and elves are wondrous
fair to look upon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam thank you kindly and when youve
finished discussing us perhaps youll say who you are and why you cant let
two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughed grimly i am faramir captain of gondor he
said but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the dark
tower or of the white
but we are neither said frodo and travellers we are whatever captain
faramir may say
then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand said faramir we
have a work to do and this is no time or place for riddling or parleying come
where is the third of your company 
the third 
yes the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down yonder
he had an ill-favoured look some spying breed of orc i guess or a creature of
theirs but he gave us the slip by some fox-trick
i do not know where he is said frodo he is only a chance companion met
upon our road and i am not answerable for him if you come on him spare him
bring him or send him to us he is only a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him under my care for a while but as for us we are hobbits of the shire far
to the north and west beyond many rivers frodo son of drogo is my name and
with me is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service we have come
by long ways - out of rivendell or imladris as some call it here faramir
started and grew intent seven companions we had: one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros: two of my kin a dwarf there was
also and an elf and two men they were aragorn and boromir who said that he
came out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir  all the four men exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denethor said faramir and a strange stern look
came into his face you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers that boromir son of denethor was high warden of the
white tower and our captain-general: sorely do we miss him who are you then
and what had you to do with him be swift for the sun is climbing
are the riddling words known to you that boromir brought to rivendell 
frodo replied
seek for the sword that was broken

in imladris it dwells
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment it is some token
of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken said
frodo and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see said faramir thoughtfully or i see that it might be so and
what is isildurs bane 
that is hidden answered frodo doubtless it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramir and know what brings you so far
east under the shadow of yonder- he pointed and said no name but not now we
have business in hand you are in peril and you would not have gone far by
field or road this day there will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the day
is full then death or swift flight bark to anduin i will leave two to guard
you for your good and for mine wise man trusts not to chance-meeting on the
road in this land if i return i will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low think what you will i am a friend of
all enemies of the one enemy we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as you seem and if my errand
permitted it may the light shine on your swords
the halflings are courteous folk whatever else they be said faramir
farewell
the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing to one another of their
thoughts and doubts close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay-trees two men remained on guard they took off their masks now and again to
cool them as the day-heat grew and frodo saw that they were goodly men
pale-skinned dark of hair with grey eyes and faces sad and proud they spoke
together in soft voices at first using the common speech but after the manner
of older days and then changing to another language of their own to his
amazement as he listened frodo became aware that
it was the elven-tongue that they spoke or one but little different and he
looked at them with wonder for he knew then that they must be dúnedain
of the south men of the line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and they were
rangers of ithilien for they were descended from folk who lived in ithilien at
one time before it was overrun from such men the lord denethor
chose his forayers who crossed the anduin secretly how or where they would
not say to harry the orcs and other enemies that roamed between the ephel dúath
and the river
it is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of anduin said mablung
and we seldom come so far afield but we have a new errand on this journey: we
come to ambush the men of harad curse them 
aye curse the southrons  said damrod  tis said that there were
dealings of old between gondor and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south
though there was never friendship in those days our bounds were away south
beyond the mouths of anduin and umbar the nearest of their realms
acknowledged our sway but that is long since tis many lives of men since any
passed to or fro between us now of late we have learned that the enemy has been
among them and they are gone over to him or back to him-they were ever ready
to his will-as have so many also in the east i doubt not that the days of
gondor are numbered and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great is his
strength and malice
but still we will not sit idle and let him do all as he would said
mablung these cursed southrons come now marching up the ancient roads to swell
the hosts of the dark tower yea up the very roads that craft of gondor made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that the power of their new
master is great enough so that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teach them another lesson great strength of them was reported to us
some days ago marching north one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon-up on the road above where it passes through the
cloven way the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures but his life is charmed or fate spares
him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence all seemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern-brake peered out with his keen
hobbit-eyes he saw that many more men were about he could see them stealing up
the slopes singly or in long files keeping always to the shade of grove or
thicket or crawling hardly visible in their brown and green raiment through
grass and brake all were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their hands
and were armed like faramir and his companions before long they had all passed
and vanished the sun rose till it neared the south the shadows shrank
i wonder where that dratted gollum is  thought sam as he crawled back
into deeper shade he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an orc or of
being roasted by the yellow face but i fancy hell look after himself he lay
down beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing he sat up it was now high
noon the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees suddenly the
horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also but the sound was faint
as if it came out of some distant cave then presently the noise of fighting
broke out near at hand just above their hiding-place he could hear plainly the
ringing grate of steel on steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull beat
of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming and one clear loud voice was
calling gondor gondor
it sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together said sam to
frodo theyre as near as i want them now
but the noise grew closer they are coming cried damrod see some of the
southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road there they go
our men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards he scrambled a little
way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees for a moment he caught a glimpse
of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off with green-clad
warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled arrows were thick in
the air then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank a man
fell crashing through the slender trees nearly on top of them he came to rest
in the fern a few feet away face downward green arrow-feathers sticking from
his neck below a golden collar his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet of
overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair braided
with gold were drenched with blood his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a
broken sword
it was sams first view of a battle of men against men and he did not like
it much he was glad that he could not see the dead face he wondered what the
mans name was and where he came from and if he was really evil of heart or
what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home and if he
would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash of thought
which was quickly driven from his mind for just as mablung stepped towards the
fallen body there was a new noise great crying and shouting amidst it sam
heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinning on the ground
ware ware cried damrod to his companion may the valar turn him aside mûmak
mûmak
to his astonishment and terror and lasting
delight sam saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the
slope big as a house much bigger than a house it looked to him a grey-clad
moving hill fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes but the
mûmak of harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk and the like of him
does not walk now in middle-earth his kin that live still in latter days are
but memories of his girth and majesty on he came straight towards the
watchers and then swerved aside in the nick of time passing only a few yards
away rocking the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees enormous
sail-like ears spread out long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to
strike his small red eyes raging his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with
bands of gold and dripped with blood his trappings of scarlet and gold flapped
about him in wild tatters the ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his furious passage through the woods and high
upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure-the body of a mighty
warrior a giant among the swertings
on the great beast thundered blundering in blind wrath through pool and
thicket arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his
flanks men of both sides fled before him but many he overtook and crushed to
the ground soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
what became of him sam never heard: whether he escaped to roam the wild for a
time until he perished far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit or
whether he raged on until he plunged in the great river and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breath an oliphaunt it was he said so there are
oliphaunts and i have seen one what a life but no one at home will ever
believe me well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung but the captain will return if he is
unhurt and when he comes we shall depart swiftly we shall be pursued as soon
as news of our deed reaches the enemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam no need to disturb my sleep i was
walking all night
mablung laughed i do not think the captain will leave you here master
samwise he said but you shall see
 
it seemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to
find that it was late afternoon and faramir had come back he had brought many
men with him indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the
slope nearby two or three hundred strong they sat in a wide semicircle
between the arms of which faramir was seated on the ground while frodo stood
before him it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid any attention to him and he
placed himself at the end of the rows of men where he could see and hear all
that was going on he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his
masters aid if needed he could see faramirs face which was now unmasked: it
was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance doubt
was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with frodos account
of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the company that set
out from rivendell why he had left boromir and where he was now going in
particular he returned often to isildurs bane plainly he saw that frodo was
concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that isildurs bane should waken
or so one must read the words he insisted if then you are the halfling that
was named doubtless you brought this thing whatever it may be to the council
of which you speak and there boromir saw it do you deny it 
frodo made no answer so  said faramir i wish then to learn from you
more of it for what concerns boromir concerns me an orc-arrow slew isildur so
far as old tales tell but orc-arrows are plenty and the sight of one would not
be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor had you this thing in keeping
it is hidden you say but is not that because you choose to hide it 
no not because i choose answered frodo it does not belong to me it
does not belong to any mortal great or small though if any could claim it it
would be aragorn son of arathorn whom i named the leader of our company from
moria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city that the sons of elendil
founded 
because aragorn is descended in direct lineage father to father from
isildur elendils son himself and the sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men some cried aloud:
the sword of elendil the sword of elendil comes to minas tirith great
tidings  but faramirs face was unmoved
maybe he said but so great a claim will need to be established and clear
proofs will be required should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith he had
not come nor any of your company when i set out six days ago
boromir was satisfied of that claim said frodo indeed if boromir were
here he would answer all your questions and since he was already at rauros
many days back and intended then to go straight to your city if you return
you may soon learn the answers there my part in the company was known to him
as to all the others for it was appointed to me by elrond of imladris himself
before the whole council on that errand i came into this country but it is not
mine to reveal to any outside the company yet those who claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam approved of it but it did
not appease faramir
so he said you bid me mind my own affairs and get me back home and let
you be boromir will tell all when he comes when he comes say you were you a
friend of boromir
vividly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs assault upon him
and for a moment he hesitated faramirs eyes watching him grew harder boromir
was a valiant member of our company  said frodo at length yes i was his
friend for my part
faramir smiled grimly then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead

i would grieve indeed said frodo then catching the look in faramirs
eyes he faltered dead he said do you mean that he is dead and that you
knew it you have been trying to trap me in words playing with me or are you
now trying to snare me with a falsehood
i would not snare even an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know of it since you say that none of
the company had reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his death i had hoped that his friend and companion
would tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong when we parted and he lives still for all that
i know though surely there are many perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation
these last words were more than he could bear and bursting into the middle of
the ring he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so after all youve gone through as much for his
good and all these great men as for anyone else
see here captain  he planted himself squarely in front of faramir his
hands on his hips and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offered him what he called sauce when questioned about visits to the
orchard there was some murmuring but also some grins on the faces of the men
looking on: the sight of their captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyond their
experience see here  he said what are you driving at lets come to the
point before all the orcs of mordor come down on us if you think my master
murdered this boromir and then ran away youve got no sense but say it and
have done and then let us know what you mean to do about it but its a pity
that folk as talk about fighting the enemy cant let others do their bit in
their own way without interfering hed be mighty pleased if he could see you
now think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without anger do not speak before your
master whose wit is greater than yours and i do not need any to teach me of
our peril even so i spare a brief time in order to judge justly in a hard
matter were i as hasty as you i might have slain you long ago for i am
commanded to slay all whom i find in this land without the leave of the lord of
gondor but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and not gladly even when it
is needed neither do i talk in vain so be comforted sit by your master and
be silent 
sam sat down heavily with a red face faramir turned to frodo again: you
asked how do i know that the son of denethor is dead tidings of death have many
wings night oft brings news to near kindred tis said boromir was my
brother
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face do you remember aught of special
mark that the lord boromir bore with him among his gear
frodo thought for a moment fearing some further trap and wondering how this
debate would turn in the end he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir and how he would fare now among so many men warlike and strong he
did not know yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he was much like his
brother in looks was a man less self-regarding both sterner and wiser i
remember that boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your minds eye: a great horn of the wild ox of
the east bound with silver and written with ancient characters that horn the
eldest son of our house has borne for many generations and it is said that if
it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of gondor as the realm was of
old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i set out on this venture eleven days ago at about this hour
of the day i heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it seemed but
dim as if it were but an echo in the mind a boding of ill we thought it my
father and i for no tidings had we heard of boromir since he went away and no
watcher on our borders had seen him pass and on the third night after another
and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in the grey dark under the young
pale moon watching the ever-moving stream and the sad reeds were rustling so
do we ever watch the shores nigh osgiliath which our enemies now partly hold
and issue from it to harry our lands but that night all the world slept at the
midnight hour then i saw or it seemed that i saw a boat floating on the
water glimmering grey a small boat of a strange fashion with a high prow and
there was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was round it but i rose and went to the
bank and began to walk out into the stream for i was drawn towards it then
the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace and floated slowly by within my
hands reach yet i durst not handle it it waded deep as if it were heavily
burdened and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost
filled with clear water from which came the light and lapped in the water a
warrior lay asleep
a broken sword was on his knee i saw many wounds on him it was boromir my
brother dead i knew his gear his sword his beloved face one thing only i
missed: his horn one thing only i knew not: a fair belt as it were of linked
golden leaves about his waist boromir i cried where is thy horn
whither goest thou o boromir but he was gone the boat turned into the
stream and passed glimmering on into the night dreamlike it was and yet no
dream for there was no waking and i do not doubt that he is dead and has
passed down the river to the sea
alas said frodo that was indeed boromir as
i knew him for the golden belt was given to him in lothlórien by the
lady galadriel she it was that clothed us as you see us in elven-grey this
brooch is of the same workmanship he touched the green and silver leaf
that fastened his cloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closely at it it is beautiful he said yes tis work of
the same craft so then you passed through the land of lórien laurelindórenan
it was named of old but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of
men he added softly regarding frodo with a new wonder in his eyes much that
was strange about you i begin now to understand will you not tell me more for
it is a bitter thought that boromir died within sight of the land of his home
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo though your tale fills
me with foreboding a vision it was that you saw i think and no more some
shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be unless indeed it is some lying
trick of the enemy i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old laid in sleep
beneath the pools of the dead marshes or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir for his works fill the heart with
loathing but my heart was filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth  asked frodo for no
boat could have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir and boromir
purposed to go home across the entwash and the fields of rohan and yet how
could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling
pools though laden with water 
i know not said faramir but whence came the boat 
from lórien said frodo in three such boats we rowed down anduin
to the falls they also were of elven-work
you passed through the hidden land said faramir but it seems that you
little understood its power if men have dealings with the mistress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow for
it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this sun and few of
old came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried what did she say to you the lady
that dies not what did she see what woke in your heart then why went you ever
to laurelindórenan and came not by your own road upon the horses of
rohan riding home in the morning
then turning again to frodo he spoke in a quiet voice once more to those
questions i guess that you could make some answer frodo son of drogo but not
here or now maybe but lest you still should think my tale a vision i will
tell you this the horn of boromir at least returned in truth and not in
seeming the horn came but it was cloven in two as it were by axe or sword
the shards came severally to shore: one was found among the reeds where watchers
of gondor lay northwards below the infalls of the entwash the other was found
spinning on the flood by one who had an errand in the water strange chances
but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of
denethor sitting in his high chair waiting for news and you can tell me
nothing of the cleaving of the horn 
no i did not know of it said frodo but the day when you heard it
blowing if your reckoning is true was the day when we parted when i and my
servant left the company and now your tale fills me with dread for if boromir
was then in peril and was slain i must fear that all my companions perished
too and they were my kindred and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go i am weary and full
of grief and afraid but i have a deed to do or to attempt before i too am
slain and the more need of haste if we two halflings are all that remain of
our fellowship
go back faramir valiant captain of gondor and defend your city while you
may and let me go where my doom takes me
for me there is no comfort in our speech together said faramir but you
surely draw from it more dread than need be unless
the people of lórien themselves came to him who arrayed boromir as for a
funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless some of your company i guess
live still
but whatever befell on the north march you frodo i doubt no longer if
hard days have made me any judge of mens words and faces then i may make a
guess at halflings though and now he smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvish air maybe but more lies upon our words together
than i thought at first i should now take you back to minas tirith to answer
there to denethor and my life will justly be forfeit if i now choose a course
that proves ill for my city so i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders at once the men who were
gathered round him broke up into small groups and went off this way and that
vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees soon only mablung and
damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose it will be
unsafe for some days and always more closely watched after this affray than it
has been yet and you cannot i think go far today in any case for you are
weary and so are we we are going now to a secret place we have somewhat less
than ten miles from here the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet
and if they did we could hold it long even against many there we may lie up
and rest for a while and you with us in the morning i will decide what is best
for me to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to fall in with this request or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment since this foray of the men
of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they set out at once: mablung and damrod a little ahead and faramir with
frodo and sam behind skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had
bathed they crossed the stream climbed a long bank and passed into
green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards while they
walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go they talked in hushed voices
i broke off our speech together said faramir not only because time
pressed as master samwise had reminded me but also because we were drawing
near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men it was for
that reason that i turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be isildurs
bane you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
i do not blame you said faramir you spoke with skill in a hard place
and wisely it seemed to me but i learned or guessed more from you than your
words said you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in
friendship you and master samwise too i guess have some grievance now i
loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his death yet i knew him well isildurs
bane - i would hazard that isildurs bane lay between you and was a
cause of contention in your company clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some
sort and such things do not breed peace among confederates not if aught may be
learned from ancient tales do i not hit near the mark
near said frodo but not in the gold there was no contention in our
company though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from the emyn
muil but be that as it may ancient tales teach us also the peril of rash words
concerning such things as - heirlooms
ah then it is as i thought: your trouble was with boromir alone he wished
this thing brought to minas tirith alas it is a crooked fate that seals your
lips who saw him last and holds from me that which i long to know: what was in
his heart and thought in his latest hours whether he erred or no of this i am
sure: he died well achieving some good thing his face was more beautiful even
than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at first about isildurs bane forgive
me it was unwise in such an hour and place i had not had time for thought we
had had a hard fight and there was more than enough to fill my mind but even
as i spoke with you i drew nearer to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is still preserved of
ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad we of my
house are not of the line of elendil though the blood of númenor is in
us for we reckon back our line to mardil the good steward who ruled in the
kings stead when he went away to war and that was king eärnur last of
the line of anárion and childless and he came never back and the
stewards have governed the city since that day though it was many generations
of men ago
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when we together learned the tale
of our sires and the history of our city that always it displeased him that his
father was not king "how many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward
a king if the king returns not " he asked "few years maybe in
other places of less royalty" my father answered "in gondor ten
thousand years would not suffice" alas poor boromir does that not tell
you something of him 
it does said frodo yet always he treated aragorn with honour
i doubt it not said faramir if he were satisfied of aragorns claim as
you say he would greatly reverence him but the pinch has not yet come they
had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars
but i stray we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore by long
tradition and there are moreover in our treasuries many things preserved: books
and tablets writ on withered parchments yea and on stone and on leaves of
silver and of gold in divers characters some none can now read and for the
rest few ever unlock them i can read a little in them for i have had
teaching it was these records that brought the grey pilgrim to us i first saw
him when i was a child and he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim  said frodo had he a name
mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said mithrandir
among the elves tharkûn to the dwarves olórin i was in my youth
in the west that is forgotten in the south incánus in the north
gandalf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo i thought it was he gandalf the grey dearest of
counsellors leader of our company he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost  said faramir an evil fate seems to have pursued
your fellowship it is hard indeed to believe that one of so great wisdom and
of power - for many wonderful things he did among us - could perish and so much
lore be taken from the world are you sure of this and that he did not just
leave you and depart where he would 
alas yes said frodo i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of dread in this said faramir which
perhaps you may tell me in the evening-time this mithrandir was i now guess
more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream he could
have made them clear to us without need of messenger yet maybe he would not
have done so and the journey of boromir was doomed mithrandir never spoke to
us of what was to be nor did he reveal his purposes he got leave of denethor
how i do not know to look at the secrets of our treasury and i learned a
little of him when he would teach and that was seldom ever he would search
and would question us above all else concerning the great battle that was fought
upon dagorlad in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name was
overthrown and he was eager for stories of isildur though of him we had less
to tell for nothing certain was ever known among us of his end
now faramirs voice sank to a whisper but this much i learned or guessed
and i have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that isildur took somewhat
from the hand of the unnamed ere he went away from gondor never to be seen
among mortal men again here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs
questioning but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after
ancient learning nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among
us did i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing for isildur
was ambushed and slain by orc-arrows according to the only legend that we knew
and mithrandir had never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess but some heirloom of power
and peril it must be a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark lord if it
were a thing that gave advantage in battle i can well believe that boromir the
proud and fearless often rash ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing and be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that errand i should have been chosen by my father
and the elders but he put himself forward as being the older and the hardier
both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thing if it lay by the highway not
were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone could save her so using the
weapon of the dark lord for her good and my glory no i do not wish for such
triumphs frodo son of drogo
neither did the council said frodo nor do i i would have nothing to do
with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white tree in flower again in
the courts of the kings and the silver crown return and minas tirith in peace:
minas anor again as of old full of light high and fair beautiful as a queen
among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress
of willing slaves war must be while we defend our
lives against a destroyer who would devour all but i do not love the bright
sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for its swiftness nor the warrior for
his glory i love only that which they defend: the city of the men of númenor
and i would have her loved for her memory her ancientry her beauty and
her present wisdom not feared save as men may fear the dignity of a man old
and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to tell me more i do not even ask you to
tell me whether i now speak nearer the mark but if you will trust me it may be
that i can advise you in your present quest whatever that be-yes and even aid
you
frodo made no answer almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel
to tell this grave young man whose words seemed so wise and fair all that was
in his mind but something held him back his heart was heavy with fear and
sorrow: if he and sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was now left of
the nine walkers then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words and the memory of boromir of the
dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in him was very present to
his mind when he looked at faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were
and yet also much akin
they walked on in silence for a while passing like grey and green shadows
under the old trees their feet making no sound above them many birds sang and
the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of
ithilien
sam had taken no part in the conversation though he had listened and at the
same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland
noises about them one thing he had noted that in all the talk the name of
gollum had not once come up he was glad though he felt that it was too much to
hope that he would never hear it again he soon became aware also that though
they walked alone there were many men close at hand: not only damrod and
mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead but others on either side all
making their swift secret way to some appointed place
once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the skin told him that he
was watched from behind he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behind a tree-trunk he opened his mouth to speak and shut it
again im not sure of it he said to himself and why should i remind them
of the old villain if they choose to forget him i wish i could
so they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to
fall more steeply then they turned aside again to the right and came quickly
to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that trickled far
above out of the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping down over
many stones in a deep-cloven bed overhung with ilex and dark box-woods looking
west they could see below them in a haze of light lowlands and broad meads
and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramir "i hope you
will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not
to slay you or to bind you but it is a command that no stranger not even one
of rohan that fights with us shall see the path we now go with open eyes i
must blindfold you
as you will said frodo even the elves do likewise at need and
blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair lothlórien gimli the dwarf
took it ill but the hobbits endured it
it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you said faramir but i am
glad that you will take this willingly and not by force
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped out of the trees
and came back to him blindfold these guests said faramir securely but not
so as to discomfort them do not tie their hands they will give their word not
to try and see i could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord but
eyes will blink if the feet stumble lead them so that they do not falter
with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits eyes and drew
their hoods down almost to their mouths then quickly they took each one by the
hand and went on their way all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile of the
road they learned from guessing in the dark after a little they found that they
were on a path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they went in
single file brushing a stony wall on either side their guards steered them
from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders now and again they came
to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while and then set down
again always the noise of the running water was on their right hand and it
grew nearer and louder at length they were halted quickly mablung and damrod
turned them about several times and they lost all sense of direction they
climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become
faint then they were picked up and carried down down many steps and round a
corner suddenly they heard the water again loud now rushing and splashing
all round them it seemed and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks
at last they were set on their feet once more for a moment they stood so half
fearful blindfold not knowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind let them see  he said the
scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the doorstep as it were of a
rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them but in front a thin veil of
water was hung so near that frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it
it faced westward the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it and
the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever-changing colour it
was as if they stood at the window of some elven-tower curtained with threaded
jewels of silver and gold and ruby sapphire and amethyst all kindled with an
unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for your
patience said faramir this is the window of the sunset henneth annûn
fairest of all the falls of ithilien land of many fountains few strangers have
ever seen it but there is no kingly hall behind to match it enter now
and see 
even as he spoke the sun sank and the fire faded in the flowing water they
turned and passed under the low forbidding arch at once they found themselves
in a rock-chamber wide and rough with an uneven stooping roof a few torches
were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls many men were already
there others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door
on one side as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the
cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms
and victuals
well here is our refuge said faramir not a place of great ease but here
you may pass the night in peace it is dry at least and there is food though
no fire at one time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the
arch but its course was changed further up the gorge by workmen of old and
the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above all
the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught
else all save one there are now but two ways out: that passage yonder by which
you entered blindfold and through the window-curtain into a deep bowl filled
with knives of stone now rest a while until the evening meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on if they
wished meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly
quickness light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and
laden with gear this was plain and unadorned for the most part but all well
and fairly made: round platters bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or
turned box-wood smooth and clean here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by the captains seat in the middle
of the inmost table
faramir went about among the men questioning each as he came in in a soft
voice some came back from the pursuit of the southrons others left behind
as scouts near the road came in latest all the southrons had been accounted
for save only the great mûmak: what happened to him none could say of
the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc-spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man no orc at least but i saw or thought i
saw something a little strange it was getting deep dusk when the eyes make
things greater than they should be so perhaps it may have been no more than a
squirrel sam pricked up his ears at this yet if so it was a black squirrel
and i saw no tail twas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked behind a
tree-trunk when i drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose and it seemed no more so
i tried no arrow it was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the creature was
gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling but i stayed for a while for
it seemed strange and then i hastened back i thought i heard the thing hiss at
me from high above as i turned away a large squirrel maybe perhaps under the
shadow of the unnamed some of the beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our
woods they have black squirrels there tis said
perhaps said faramir but that would be an ill omen if it were so we do
not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien sam fancied that he gave a swift
glance towards the hobbits as he spoke but sam said nothing for a while he and
frodo lay back and watched the torchlight and the men moving to and fro
speaking in hushed voices then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that he may be all right
he thought and then he may not fair speech may hide a foul heart he yawned
i could sleep for a week and id be better for it and what can i do if i do
keep awake me all alone and all these great men about nothing sam gamgee
but youve got to keep awake all the same and somehow he managed it the light
faded from the cave door and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and was
lost in gathering shadow always the sound of the water went on never changing
its note morning or evening or night it murmured and whispered of sleep sam
stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit a cask of wine was broached storage barrels
were being opened men were fetching water from the fall some were laving their
hands in basins a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to faramir
and he washed
wake our guests he said and take them water it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched sam not used to being waited on
looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed holding a basin of water
before him
put it on the ground master if you please  he said easier for me and
you then to the astonishment and amusement of the men he plunged his head into
the cold water and splashed his neck and ears
is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper  said the man
who waited on the hobbits
no before breakfast said sam but if youre short of sleep cold water on
the necks like rain on a wilted lettuce there now i can keep awake long
enough to eat a bit
they were led then to seats beside faramir: barrels covered with pelts and
high enough above the benches of the men for their convenience before they ate
faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence faramir
signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise
so we always do he said as they sat down: we look towards númenor
that was and beyond to elvenhome that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome
and will ever be have you no such custom at meat 
no said frodo feeling strangely rustic and untutored but if we are
guests we bow to our host and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent ¤n the lonely wild the
evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine cool and
fragrant and eat bread and butter and salted meats and dried fruits and good
red cheese with clean hands and clean knives and plates neither frodo nor sam
refused anything that was offered nor a second nor
indeed a third helping the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land
of lórien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave
partly screened by curtains and a chair and two stools were brought there a
little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially good samwise who
would not close his eyes before he ate - whether for fear of blunting the edge
of a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not know but it is not good to sleep
too soon after meat and that following a fast let us talk a while on your
journey from rivendell there must have been many things to tell and you too
would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the
lands where you now are tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lothlórien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk but though the food
and wine had put him at his ease he had not lost all his caution sam was
beaming and humming to himself but when frodo spoke he was at first content to
listen only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
frodo told many tales yet always he steered the matter away from the quest
of the company and from the ring enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir
had played in all their adventures with the wolves of the wild in the snows
under caradhras and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell faramir was most
moved by the story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir to run from orcs he said or even from the
fell thing you name the balrog - even though he was the last to leave
he was the last said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us he alone
knew the way after gandalfs fall but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir
said faramir and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of
rauros
maybe but tell me now of your own fortunes said frodo turning the matter
aside once again for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath and
minas tirith the long-enduring what hope have you for that city in your long
war 
what hope have we  said faramir it is long since we had any hope the
sword of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle it but i do not think that
it will do more than put off the evil day unless other help unlooked-for also
comes from elves or men for the enemy increases and we decrease we are a
failing people a springless autumn
the men of númenor were settled far and wide on the shores and
seaward regions of the great lands but for the most part they fell into
evils and follies many became enamoured of the darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and some fought among
themselves until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised in gondor or that the
nameless one was ever named in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty
brought out of the west remained long in the realm of the sons of elendil the
fair and they linger there still yet even so it was gondor that brought about
its own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that the enemy was
asleep who was only banished not destroyed
death was ever present because the númenoreans still as they had in
their old kingdom and so lost it hungered after endless life
unchanging kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living and
counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in secret
chambers withered men compounded strong elixirs or in high cold towers asked
questions of the stars and the last king of the line of anárion had no
heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate wiser for they recruited
the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea-coast and from the
hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais and they made a truce with the proud peoples
of the north who often had assailed us men of fierce valour but our kin from
afar off unlike the wild easterlings or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cirion the twelfth steward and my father
is the sit and twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the great field of
celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them masters of horses and we ceded to them
the fields of calenardhon that are since called rohan for that province had
long been sparsely peopled and they became our allies and have ever proved
true to us aiding us at need and guarding our northern marches and the gap of
rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they would and their lords
speak our speech at need yet for the most part they hold by the ways of their
own fathers and to their own memories and they speak among themselves their own
north tongue and we love them: tall men and fair women valiant both alike
golden-haired bright-eyed and strong they remind us of the youth of men as
they were in the elder days indeed it is said by our lore-masters
that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those
same three houses of men as were the númenoreans in their beginning not
from hador the goldenhaired the elf-friend maybe yet from such of his sons
and people as went not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore calling them the high or men of the west
which were númenoreans and the middle peoples men of the twilight such
as are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the north and
the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us enhanced in
arts and gentleness we too have become more like to them and can scarce claim
any longer the title high we are become middle men of the twilight but with
memory of other things for as the rohirrim do we now love war and valour as
things good in themselves both a sport and an end and though we still hold
that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of
weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other
crafts such is the need of our days so even was my brother boromir: a man of
prowess and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor and very valiant
indeed he was: no heir of minas tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn faramir
sighed and fell silent for a while
you dont say much in all your tales about the elves sir said sam
suddenly plucking up courage he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and his food and wine had
won sams respect and quieted his suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not
learned in elven-lore but there you touch upon another point in which we have
changed declining from númenor to middle-earth for as you may know if
mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken with elrond the edain the
fathers of the númenoreans fought beside the elves in the first
wars and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the sea
within sight of elvenhome but in middle-earth men and elves became estranged in
the days of darkness by the arts of the enemy and by the slow changes of time
in which each kind walked further down their sundered roads men now fear and
misdoubt the elves and yet know little of them and we of gondor grow like
other men like the men of rohan for even they who are the foes of the dark
lord shun the elves and speak of the golden wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the elves when they
may and ever and anon one will go in secret to lórien seldom to return
not i for i deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the
elder people yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lórien galadriel cried sam you should see her indeed
you should sir i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at home sir if you
understand me and im not much good at poetry - not at making it: a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and again you know but not real poetry - so i
cant tell you what i mean it ought to be sung youd have to get strider
aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for that but i wish i could make a song
about her beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tree in flower
sometimes like a white daffadowndilly small and slender like hard as dimonds
soft as moonlight warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars proud and
far-off as a snow-mountain and as merry as any lass i ever saw with daisies in
her hair in springtime but thats a lot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir perilously fair
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into lórien and
finds it there because theyve brought it but perhaps you could call her
perilous because shes so strong in herself you you could dash yourself to pieces
on her like a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river but
neither rock nor river would be to blame now boro -  he stopped and went red
in the face
yes now boromir you would say  said faramir what would you say
he took his peril with him 
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as your brother was if i may
say so but youve been warm on the scent all along now i watched boromir and
listened to him from rivendell all down the road - looking after my master as
youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromir - and its my opinion
that in lórien he first saw clearly what i guessed sooner: what he
wanted from the moment he first saw it he wanted the enemys ring 
sam  cried frodo aghast he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me  said sam turning white and then flushing scarlet there i go
again when ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer
used to say to me and right enough o dear o dear
now look here sir  he turned facing up to faramir with all the courage
that he could muster dont you go taking advantage of my master because his
servants no better than a fool youve spoken very handsome all along put me
off my guard talking of elves and all but handsome is as handsome does
we say nows a chance to show your quality
so it seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddles the one ring that was thought to have
perished from the world and boromir tried to take it by force and you escaped
and ran all the way - to me and here in the wild i have you: two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings a pretty stroke of fortune a
chance for faramir captain of gondor to show his quality ha he stood up
very tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with
their backs to the wall fumbling for their sword-hilts there was a silence
all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder but
faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly and then
suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial  he said how you have
increased my sorrow you two strange wanderers from a far country bearing the
peril of men but you are less judges of men than i of halflings we are
truth-speakers we men of gondor we boast seldom and then perform or die in
the attempt not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man as to desire this thing and even though i knew not
clearly what this thing was when i spoke still i should take those words as a
vow and be held by them
but i am not such a man or i am wise enough to know that there are some
perils from which a man must flee sit at peace and be comforted samwise if
you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so your heart is
shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes for strange though
it may seem it was safe to declare this to me it may even help the master that
you love it shall turn to his good if it is in my power so be comforted but
do not even name this thing again aloud once is enough
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet men turned back to
their drink and their talk perceiving that their captain had had some jest or
other with the little guests and that it was over
well frodo now at last we understand one another said faramir if you
took this thing on yourself unwilling at others asking then you have pity
and honour from me and i marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use it you
are a new people and a new world to me are all your kin of like sort your land
must be a realm of peace and content and there must gardeners be in high
honour
not all is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grow weary there even in their gardens as do all things
under the sun of this world and you are far from home and wayworn no more
tonight sleep both of you - in peace if you can fear not i do not wish to
see it or touch it or know more of it than i know which is enough lest
peril perchance waylay me and i fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest - but first tell me only if you will whither you wish to go
and what to do for i must watch and wait and think time passes in the
morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed now a
great weariness came down on him like a cloud he could dissemble and resist no
longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faintly i was going to
gorgoroth i must find the mountain of fire and cast the thing into the gulf of
doom gandalf said so i do not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment then suddenly he
caught him as he swayed and lifting him gently carried him to the bed and laid
him there and covered him warmly at once he fell into a deep sleep
another bed was set beside him for his servant sam hesitated for a moment
then bowing very low: good night captain my lord he said you took the
chance sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality: the very highest
faramir smiled a pert servant master samwise but nay: the praise of the
praiseworthy is above all rewards yet there was naught in this to praise i had
no lure or desire to do other than i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master had an elvish air and that was
good and true but i can say this: you have an air too sir that reminds me of
of - well gandalf of wizards
maybe said faramir maybe you discern from
far away the air of númenor good night
 
frodo woke to find faramir bending over him for a second old fears seized
him and he sat up and shrank away
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is it morning already  said frodo yawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and the full moon is setting will
you come and see it also there is a matter on which i desire your counsel i am
sorry to rouse you from sleep but will you come 
i will said frodo rising and shivering a little as he left the warm
blanket and pelts it seemed cold in the fireless cave the noise of the water
was loud in the stillness he put on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness saw first his masters
empty bed and leapt to his feet then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale white light he
hurried after them past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall as
he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the curtain was now become a dazzling veil
of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight but he did
not pause to admire it and turning aside he followed his master through the
narrow doorway in the wall of the cave
they went first along a black passage then up many wet steps and so came to
a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky gleaming high
above through a long deep shaft from here two flights of steps led: one going
on as it seemed up on to the high bank of the stream the other turning away
to the left this they followed it wound its way up like a turret-stair
at last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about they were on a
wide flat rock without rail or parapet at their right eastwards the torrent
fell splashing over many terraces and then pouring down a steep race it
filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam and
curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that
yawned upon their left a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away the world was quiet and cold as if
dawn were near far off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf of silver fume
beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the anduin a black darkness
loomed beyond and in it glinted here and there cold sharp remote white as
the teeth of ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of the realm
of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone and a shiver ran through
him wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night-lands his old companions
walked or slept or lay dead shrouded in mist why was he brought here out of
forgetful sleep
sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain
himself from muttering for his masters ear alone as he thought: its a fine
view no doubt mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mention the bones
whats going on 
faramir heard and answered moonset over gondor fair ithil as he goes from
middle-earth glances upon the white locks of old mindolluin it is worth a few
shivers but that is not what i brought you to see-though as for you samwise
you were not brought and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness a draught
of wine shall amend it come look now 
he stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge and frodo
followed sam hung back he already felt insecure enough on this high wet
platform faramir and frodo looked down far below them they saw the white
waters pour into a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin
in the rocks until they found their way out again through a narrow gate and
flowed away fuming and chattering into calmer and more level reaches the
moonlight still slanted down to the falls foot and gleamed on the ripples of
the basin presently frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank but
even as he looked at it it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble
of the fall cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise
stone
faramir turned to the man at his side now what would you say that it is
anborn a squirrel or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers in the
night-pools of mirkwood 
tis not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn it has four limbs
and dives manwise a pretty mastery of the craft it shows too what is it at
seeking a way up behind the curtain to our hidings it seems we are discovered
at last i have my bow here and i have posted other archers nigh as good
marksmen as myself on either bank we wait only for your command to shoot
captain
shall we shoot  said faramir turning quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer for a moment then no  he said no i beg you not
to if sam had dared he would have said yes quicker and louder he could
not see but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at
you know then what this thing is  said faramir come now you have
seen tell me why it should be spared in all our words together you have not
once spoken of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time he could
wait till he was caught and brought before me i sent my keenest huntsmen to
seek him but he slipped them and they had no sight of him till now save
anborn here once at dusk yesterevening but now he has done worse trespass than
only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has dared to come to henneth annûn
and his life is forfeit i marvel at the creature: so secret and so sly as he
is to come sporting in the pool before our very window does he think
that men sleep without watch all night why does he so
there are two answers i think said frodo for one thing he knows little
of men and sly though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not
know that men are concealed here for another i think he is allured here by a
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say  said faramir in a low voice can he does he
then know of your burden 
indeed yes he bore it himself for many years
he bore it  said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder this
matter winds itself ever in new riddles then he is pursuing it 
maybe it is precious to him but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek 
fish said frodo look 
they peered down at the dark pool a little black head appeared at the far
end of the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks there was a brief
silver glint and a swirl of tiny ripples it swam to the side and then with
marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered
as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall
at the pools end
faramir laughed softly fish  he said it is a less perilous hunger or
maybe not: fish from the pool of henneth annûn may cost him all he has to
give
now i have him at the arrow-point said anborn shall i not shoot
captain for coming unbidden to this place death is our law
wait anborn said faramir this is a harder matter than it seems what
have you to say now frodo why should we spare 
the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his
danger and gandalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you not to slay him
for that reason and for others he forbade the elves to do so i do not know
clearly why and of what i guess i cannot speak openly out here but this
creature is in some way bound up with my errand until you found us and took us
he was my guide
your guide  said faramir the matter becomes ever stranger i would do
much for you frodo but this i cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free
at his own will from here to join you later if it please him or to be caught
by orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly but how can this slippery thing of many
guises be caught save by a feathered shaft 
let me go down quietly to him said frodo you may keep your bows bent
and shoot me at least if i fail i shall not run away
go then and be swift  said faramir if he comes off alive he should be
your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days lead frodo down to the
bank anborn and go softly the thing has a nose and ears give me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing and
then up the other stair until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded
with thick bushes passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western sky he could not
see gollum he went forward a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on  he breathed in frodos ear have a care to your right if you fall
in the pool then no one but your fishing friend can help you and forget not
that there are bowmen near at hand though you may not see them
frodo crept forward using his hands gollum-like to feel his way and to
steady himself the rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery
he halted listening at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing rush of
the fall behind him then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
fissh nice fissh white face has vanished my precious at last yes now
we can eat fish in peace no not in peace precious for precious is lost yes
lost dirty hobbits nasty hobbits gone and left us gollum
and precious is gone only poor sméagol all alone no precious nasty
men theyll take it steal my precious thieves we hates them fissh
nice fissh: makes us strong makes eyes bright fingers tight yes throttle
them precious throttle them all yes if we gets chances nice fissh nice
fissh 
so it went on almost as unceasing as the waterfall only interrupted by a
faint noise of slavering and gurgling frodo shivered listening with pity and
disgust he wished it would stop and that he never need hear that voice again
anborn was not far behind he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen
to shoot they would probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off
his guard only one true shot and frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for
ever but no gollum had a claim on him now the servant has a claim on the
master for service even service in fear they would have foundered in the dead
marshes but for gollum frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf
would not have wished it
sméagol  he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the voice
sméagol  he said a little louder the voice stopped
sméagol master has come to look for you master is here come sméagol
 there was no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
come sméagol  said frodo we are in danger men will kill you if
they find you here come quickly if you wish to escape death come to master
no said the voice not nice master leaves poor sméagol
and goes with new friends master can wait sméagol hasnt finished
theres no time said frodo bring fish with you come 
no must finish fish
sméagol  said frodo desperately precious will be angry i shall
take precious and i shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke
never taste fish again come precious is waiting 
there was a sharp hiss presently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on
all fours like an erring dog called to heel he had a half-eaten fish in his
mouth and another in his hand he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and
sniffed at him his pale eyes were shining then he took the fish out of his
mouth and stood up
nice master  he whispered nice hobbit come back to poor sméagol
good sméagol comes now lets go go quickly yes through the
trees while the faces are dark yes come lets go 
yes well go soon said frodo but not at once i will go with you as i
promised i promise again but not now you are not safe yet i will save you
but you must trust me
we must trust master  said gollum doubtfully why why not go at once
where is the other one the cross rude hobbit where is he
away up there said frodo pointing to the waterfall i am not going
without him we must go back to him his heart sank this was too much like
trickery he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum to be killed
but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him and certainly what frodo
did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature it would probably
be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that frodo had saved his
life in the only way he could what else could he do - to keep faith as near
as might be with both sides come he said or the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the stream go on go on you go in front 
gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way snuffling and
suspicious presently he stopped and raised his head somethings there  he
said not a hobbit suddenly he turned back a green light was flickering in
his bulging eyes masster masster he hissed wicked tricksy false he
spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed up behind him and came
down on him a large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and pinned
him he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as he was wriggling
like an eel biting and scratching like a cat but two more men came up out of
the shadows
hold still  said one or well stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still
gollum went limp and began to whine and weep they tied him none too
gently
easy easy  said frodo he has no strength to match you dont
hurt him if you can help it hell be quieter if you dont sméagol
they wont hurt you ill go with you and you shall come to no harm not unless
they kill me too trust master 
gollum turned and spat at him the men picked him up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wretched they went through the opening
behind the bushes and back down the stairs and passages into the cave two or
three torches had been lit men were stirring sam was there and he gave a
queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried got him he said to frodo
yes well no i didnt get him he came to me because he trusted me at
first im afraid i did not want him tied up like this i hope it will be all
right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of
misery is
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits and took them to the recess at the
back of the cave faramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp had been
rekindled in its niche above his head he signed to them to sit down on the
stools beside him bring wine for the guests he said and bring the prisoner
to me
the wine was brought and then anborn came carrying gollum he removed the
cover from gollums head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support
him gollum blinked hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserable creature he looked dripping and dank smelling of fish he
still clutched one in his hand his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed
over his bony brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us  he said the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us
and weve done nothing
nothing  said faramir looking at the wretched creature with a keen
glance but without any expression in his face either of anger or pity or
wonder nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse
punishment however that is not for me to judge happily but tonight you have
come where it is death to come the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir only to come here and look
on the pool bears the penalty of death i have spared you so far at the prayer
of frodo here who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks but
you must also satisfy me what is your name whence do you come and whither do
you go what is your business 
we are lost lost said gollum no name no business no precious
nothing only empty only hungry yes we are hungry a few little fishes nasty
bony little fishes for a poor creature and they say death so wise they are
so just so very just
not very wise said faramir but just: yes perhaps as just as our little
wisdom allows unloose him frodo  faramir took a small nail-knife from his
belt and handed it to frodo gollum misunderstanding the gesture squealed and
fell down
now sméagol  said frodo you must trust me i will not
desert you answer truthfully if you can it will do you good not harm he cut
the cords on gollums wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet
come hither  said faramir look at me do you know the name of this
place have you been here before 
slowly gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into faramirs all
light went out of them and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into the
clear unwavering eyes of the man of gondor there was a still silence then
gollum dropped his head and shrank down until he was squatting on the floor
shivering we doesnt know and we doesnt want to know he whimpered never
came here never come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind and dark rooms
behind them said faramir but in this i judge that you speak the truth it is
well for you what oath will you swear never to return and never to lead any
living creature hither by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong glance at frodo yes
he knows we will promise master if he saves us well promise to it yes he
crawled to frodos feet save us nice master  he whined sméagol
promises to precious promises faithfully never come again never speak no
never no precious no
are you satisfied  said faramir
yes said frodo at least you must either accept this promise or carry
out your law you will get no more but i promised that if he came to me he
should not be harmed and i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought very good he said at last i
surrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo let him declare what he
will do with you 
but lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared your will
concerning the said frodo and until that is made known he cannot shape his
plans for himself or his companions your judgement was postponed until the
morning but that is now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir as for you frodo in so far as
lies in me under higher authority i declare you free in the realm of gondor to
the furthest of its ancient bounds save only that neither you nor any that go
with you have leave to come to this place unbidden this doom shall stand for a
year and a day and then cease unless you shall before that term come to minas
tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the city then i will
entreat him to confirm what i have done and to make it lifelong in the
meantime whomsoever you take under your protection shall be under my protection
and under the shield of gondor are you answered 
frodo bowed low i am answered he said and i place myself at your
service if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable
it is of great worth said faramir and now
do you take this creature this sméagol under your protection 
i do take sméagol under my protection said frodo sam sighed
audibly and not at the courtesies of which as any hobbit would he thoroughly
approved indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a great
many more words and bows
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum you are under doom of
death but while you walk with frodo you are safe for our part yet if ever you
be found by any man of gondor astray without him the doom shall fall and may
death find you swiftly within gondor or without if you do not well serve him
now answer me: whither would you go you were his guide he says whither were
you leading him  gollum made no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir answer me or i will reverse my
judgement  still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frodo he brought me to the black gate as i
asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land said faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the southward road  frodo
continued for he said that there is or there may be a path near to minas
ithil
minas morgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path climbs i think up into
the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city stands it
goes up to a high cleft and so down to - that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass  said faramir
no said frodo
it is called cirith ungol gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to
himself is not that its name  said faramir turning to him
no  said gollum and then he squealed as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the name once but what does the name matter to us master
says he must get in so we must try some way there is no other way to try no
no other way  said faramir how do you know that and who has explored
all the confines of that dark realm  he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
presently he spoke again take this creature away anborn treat him gently
but watch him and do not you sméagol try to dive into the falls the
rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time leave us now and
take your fish 
anborn went out and gollum went cringing before him the curtain was drawn
across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir i do not think
you should go with this creature it is wicked
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it like a canker and
the evil is growing he will lead you to no good if you will part with him i
will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of gondor
that he may name
he would not take it said frodo he would follow after me as he long has
done and i have promised many times to take him under my protection and to go
where he led you would not ask me to break faith with him
no said faramir but my heart would for it seems less evil to counsel
another man to break troth than to do so oneself especially if one sees a
friend bound unwitting to his own harm but no - if he will go with you you
must now endure him but i do not think you are holden to go to cirith ungol of
which he has told you less than he knows that much i perceived clearly in his
mind do not go to cirith ungol
where then shall i go  said frodo back to the black gate and deliver
myself up to the guard what do you know against this place that makes its name
so dreadful 
nothing certain said faramir we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men has ever done so nor has any of
us set foot upon the mountains of shadow of them we know only old report and
the rumour of bygone days but there is some dark terror that dwells in the
passes above minas morgul if cirith ungol is named old men and masters of lore
will blanch and fall silent
the valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long ago and it was a
menace and a dread while the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our keeping as you know that city was once a strong
place proud and fair minas ithil the twin sister of our own city but it was
taken by fell men whom the enemy in his first strength had dominated and who
wandered homeless and masterless after his fall it is said that their lords
were men of númenor who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the
enemy had given rings of power and he had devoured them: living ghosts
they were become terrible and evil after his going they took minas ithil and
dwelt there and they filled it and all the valley about with decay: it seemed
empty and was not so for a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls nine
lords there were and after the return of their master which they aided and
prepared in secret they grew strong again then the nine riders issued forth
from the gates of horror and we could not withstand them do not approach their
citadel you will be espied it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless
eyes do not go that way 
but where else will you direct me  said frodo you cannot yourself you
say guide me to the mountains nor over them but over the mountains i am
bound by solemn undertaking to the council to find a way or perish in the
seeking and if i turn back refusing the road in its bitter end where then
shall i go among elves or men would you have me come to gondor with this thing
the thing that drove your brother mad with desire what spell would it work in
minas tirith shall there be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filled with rottenness 
i would not have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do 
i know not only i would not have you go to death or to torment and i do
not think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such paths as i can find and there is no
time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said
faramir but at the least remember my warning: beware of this guide sméagol
he has done murder before now i read it in him he sighed
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogo you have no need of soft
words: i do not hope to see you again on any other day under this sun but you
shall go now with my blessing upon you and upon all your people rest a little
while food is prepared for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping sméagol became possessed
of the thing of which we speak and how he lost it but i will not trouble you
now if ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our
tales sitting by a wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me
then until that time or some other time beyond
the vision of the seeing-stones of númenor farewell 
he rose and bowed low to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the
cave
 
frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a
little while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began after
a while water was brought to them and then they were led to a table where food
was set for three faramir broke his fast with them he had not slept since the
battle on the day before yet he did not look weary
when they had finished they stood up may no hunger trouble you on the
road said faramir you have little provision but some small store of food
fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs you will have no
lack of water as you walk in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that flows
from imlad morgul the valley of living death this also i must tell you my
scouts and watchers have all returned even some that have crept within sight of
the morannon they all find a strange thing the land is empty nothing is on
the road and no sound of foot or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard a
waiting silence broods above the nameless land i do not know what this
portends but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion storm is coming
hasten while you may if you are ready let us go the sun will soon rise above
the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little heavier than they had
been and also two stout staves of polished wood shod with iron and with
carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting said faramir but take
these staves they may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild the
men of the white mountains use them though these have been cut down to your
height and newly shod they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved
of the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and
returning may that virtue not wholly fail under the shadow into which you go
the hobbits bowed low most gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon the way secret and
unlooked for certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown to
have found it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart gollum was brought out of some corner or
hiding-hole and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been though
he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir
your guide must be blindfolded said faramir but you and your servant
samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clutched at frodo when they came to bind
his eyes and frodo said: blindfold us all three
and cover up my eyes first and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant
this was done and they were led from the cave of henneth annûn after
they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air
fresh and sweet about them still blind they went on for some little time up
and then gently down at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of the woods again no noise of the falls could
be heard for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in
which the stream flowed to the west they could see light through the trees as
if the world came there to a sudden end at a brink looking out only on to sky
here is the last parting of our ways said faramir if you take my
counsel you will not turn eastward yet go straight on for thus you will have
the cover of the woodland for many miles on your west is an edge where the land
falls into the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long
hillsides keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest in the beginning
of your journey you may walk under daylight i think the land dreams in a false
peace and for a while all evil is withdrawn fare you well while you may
he embraced the hobbits then after the manner of his people stooping and
placing his hands upon their shoulders and kissing their foreheads go with
the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground then he turned and without looking back he left
them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away they
marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved vanishing
almost in the twinkling of an eye the forest where faramir had stood seemed
empty and drear as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back southward as if to mark his disregard of all
such courtesy gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree hungry
again already thought sam well now for it again
have they gone at last  said gollum nassty
wicked men sméagols neck still hurts him yes it does lets go 
yes let us go said frodo but if you can only speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silent 
nice master  said gollum sméagol was only joking always
forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice sméagol 
frodo and sam did not answer hoisting their packs and taking their staves in
hand they passed on into the woods of ithilien
twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by faramir:
dried fruits and salted meat enough for many days and bread enough to last
while it was still fresh gollum ate nothing
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to sink and the light
through the trees to the west grew golden and always they walked in cool green
shadow and all about them was silence the birds seemed all to have flown away
or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to the silent woods and before the fall of night they
halted weary for they had walked seven leagues or more from henneth annûn
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times but there was never a sign
of gollum who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby or had wandered restlessly
prowling through the night he did not say but he returned with the first
glimmer of light and roused his companions
must get up yes they must he said long ways to go still south and
east hobbits must make haste
that day passed much as the day before had gone except that the silence
seemed deeper the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewing gollum often paused sniffing the air and
then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on and afternoon waned the
forest opened out and the trees became larger and more scattered great ilexes
of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among
them hoary ash-trees and giant oaks just putting out their brown-green buds
about them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones
white and blue now folded for sleep and there were acres populous with the
leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were thrusting
through the mould no living creature beast or bird was to be seen but in
these open places gollum grew afraid and they walked now with caution flitting
from one long shadow to another
light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end there they sat under
an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep
crumbling bank a deep dim valley lay before them on its further side the woods
gathered again blue and grey under the sullen evening and marched on
southwards to the right the mountains of gondor glowed remote in the west
under a fire-flecked sky to the left lay darkness: the towering walls of
mordor and out of that darkness the long valley came falling steeply in an
ever-widening trough towards the anduin at its bottom ran a hurrying stream:
frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through the silence and beside it on
the hither side a road went winding down like a pale ribbon down into chill
grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched there it seemed to frodo that he
descried far off floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high dim tops and
broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark
he turned to gollum do you know where we are  he said
yes master dangerous places this is the road from the tower of the moon
master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river the ruined city
yes very nasty place full of enemies we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have come a long way out of the path must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains and we cant use this
road oh no cruel peoples come this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in the mist but
there was an evil feeling in the air as if things might indeed be passing up
and down that eyes could not see frodo shuddered as he looked again at the
distant pinnacles now dwindling into night and the sound of the water seemed
cold and cruel: the voice of morgulduin the polluted stream that flowed from
the valley of the wraiths
what shall we do  he said we have walked long and far shall we look for
some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden 
no good hiding in the dark said gollum its in day that hobbits must
hide now yes in day
oh come  said sam we must rest for a bit even if we get up again in the
middle of the night therell still be hours of dark then time enough for you to
take us a long march if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back towards the trees
working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood he would
not rest on the ground so near the evil road and after some debate they all
climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak whose thick branches springing
together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable
refuge night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit but
gollum at once curled up and went to sleep the hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum woke up: suddenly they
were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them he listened and sniffed
which seemed as they had noticed before his usual method of discovering the
time of night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said lets go
we arent and we havent growled sam but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours and the
hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again with gollum leading eastwards
up the dark sloping land they could see little for the night was now so deep
that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against
them the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult but gollum
seemed in no way troubled he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles
sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit sometimes down into black
bush-shrouded hollows and out again but if ever they went a little downward
always the further slope was longer and steeper they were climbing steadily at
their first halt they looked back and they could dimly perceive the roofs of
the forest they had left behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blank sky there seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly
out of the east eating up the faint blurred stars later the sinking moon
escaped from the pursuing cloud but it was ringed all about with a sickly
yellow glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbits day soon he said hobbits must
hurry not safe to stay in the open in these places make haste 
he quickened his pace and they followed him wearily soon they began to
climb up on to a great hog-back of land for the most part it was covered with a
thick growth of gorse and whortleberry and low tough thorns though here and
there clearings opened the scars of recent fires the gorse-bushes became more
frequent as they got nearer the top very old and tall they were gaunt and
leggy below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowers that
glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent so tall were the spiny
thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them passing through long
dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and
crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns their twisted boughs
stooping to the ground were overridden by a clambering maze of old briars deep
inside there was a hollow hall raftered with dead branch and bramble and
roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring there they lay for a while
too tired yet to eat and peering out through the holes in the covert they
watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight in the east there was a dull red
glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of dawn across the tumbled
lands between the mountains of the ephel dúath
frowned at them black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not
pass away above with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against
the fiery glow away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out
dark and black amid the shadows thrusting westward
which way do we go from here asked frodo is that the opening of-of the
morgul valley away over there beyond that black mass
need we think about it yet said sam surely were not going to move any
more today if day it is
perhaps not perhaps not said gollum but we must go soon to the
cross-roads yes to the cross-roads thats the way over there yes master
the red glare over mordor died away the twilight deepened as great vapours
rose in the east and crawled above them frodo and sam took a little food and
then lay down but gollum was restless he would not eat any of their food but
he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes sniffing and
muttering then suddenly he disappeared
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned it was his turn to sleep
first and he was soon deep in a dream he thought he was back in the bag end
garden looking for something but he had a heavy pack on his back which made
him stoop it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow and thorns and bracken
were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i can see but im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for my pipe he said and with
that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opened his eyes and wondered why he was
lying down under the hedge its in your pack all the time then he realized
first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf and next that he
was hundreds of miles from bag end he sat up it seemed to be almost dark why
had his master let him sleep on out of turn right on till evening
havent you had no sleep mr frodo he said whats the time seems to be
getting late
no it isnt said frodo but the day is getting darker instead of lighter:
darker and darker as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet and youve only
slept for about three hours
i wonder whats up said sam is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst there ever was we shall wish we were down a deep hole not just
stuck under a hedge he listened whats that thunder or drums or what is
it 
i dont know said frodo its been going on for a good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to be the heavy air
throbbing in your ears
sam looked round wheres gollum  he said hasnt he come back yet
no said frodo theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam in fact ive never taken anything on a
journey that id have been less sorry to lose on the way but it would be just
like him after coming all these miles to go and get lost now just when we
shall need him most - that is if hes ever going to be any use which i doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo i hope nothing has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into
other hands as you might say because if he does we shall soon be in for
trouble
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again louder now and
deeper the ground seemed to quiver under their feet i think we are in for
trouble anyhow said frodo im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hope as my gaffer
used to say and need of vittles as he mostways used to add you have a
bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed it must be called wore on looking out from
the covert he could see only a dun shadowless world fading slowly into a
featureless colourless gloom it felt stifling but not warm frodo slept
unquietly turning and tossing and sometimes murmuring twice sam thought he
heard him speaking gandalfs name the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was gollum on all fours peering
at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered wake up no time to
lose we must go yes we must go at once no time to lose
sam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited go now
whats your little game it isnt time yet it cant be tea-time even leastways
not in decent places where there is tea-time
silly  hissed gollum were not in decent places times running short
yes running fast no time to lose we must go wake up master wake u he
clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of sleep sat up suddenly and seized
him by the arm gollum tore himself loose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed we must go no time to lose and
nothing more could they get out of him where he had been and what he thought
was brewing to make him in such a hurry he would not say sam was filled with
deep suspicion and showed it but frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his
mind he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the
ever-gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under cover
wherever it was possible and running almost bent to the ground across any
open space but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild
could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their grey cloaks nor heard
them walking as warily as the little people can without the crack of a twig or
the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went on silently in single file oppressed by the
gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land broken only now and again by
the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the
hills down from their hiding-place they went and then turning south they
steered as straight a course as gollum could find across a long broken slope
that leaned up towards the mountains presently not far ahead looming up like
a black wall they saw a belt of trees as they drew nearer they became aware
that these were of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering high
though their tops were gaunt and broken as if tempest and lightning-blast had
swept across them but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless
roots
the cross-roads yes whispered gollum the first words that had been
spoken since they left their hiding-place we must go that way turning
eastward now he led them up the slope and then suddenly there it was before
them: the southward road winding its way about the outer feet of the mountains
until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum no paths beyond the road no
paths we must go to the cross-roads but make haste be silent 
as furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies they crept down
on to the road and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank grey as
the stones themselves and soft-footed as hunting cats at length they reached
the trees and found that they stood in a great roofless ring open in the
middle to the sombre sky and the spaces between their immense boles were like
the great dark arches of some ruined hall in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morannon before them it ran out again upon its
long journey south to their right the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness: the fourth way the road they
were to take
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo became aware that a light
was shining he saw it glowing on sams face beside him turning towards it he
saw beyond an arch of boughs the road to osgiliath running almost as straight
as a stretched ribbon down down into the west there far away beyond sad
gondor now overwhelmed in shade the sun was sinking finding at last the hem of
the great slow-rolling pall of cloud and falling in an ominous fire towards the
yet unsullied sea the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still and
solemn as the great stone kings of argonath the years had gnawed it and
violent hands had maimed it its head was gone and in its place was set in
mockery a round rough-hewn stone rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness
of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead upon its
knees and mighty chair and all about the pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with
the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old kings head: it was
lying rolled away by the roadside look sam he cried startled into speech
look the king has got a crown again
the eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken but about the high
stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold a trailing plant with
flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in
reverence for the fallen king and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow
stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo and then suddenly the brief
glimpse was gone the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the shuttering of a
lamp black night fell
 
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissing with fear and impatience we
must go he said we mustnt stand here make haste
reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west and followed as his guide led
him out into the darkness of the east they left the ring of trees and crept
along the road towards the mountains this road too ran straight for a while
but soon it began to bend away southwards until it came right under the great
shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance black and forbidding it
loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind crawling under its shadow
the road went on and rounding it sprang east again and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no longer able to care
greatly about their peril frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging him
down again as soon as the great cross-roads had been passed the weight of it
almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more now feeling the way
become steep before his feet he looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said that he would: the city of the ringwraiths he cowered against
the stony bank
a long-tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far into the mountains
upon the further side some way within the valleys arms high on a rocky seat
upon the black knees of the ephel dúath
stood the walls and tower of minas morgul all was dark about it earth and sky
but it was lit with light not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the
marble walls of minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and radiant
in the hollow of the hills paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow
eclipse was the light of it now wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation
of decay a corpse-light a light that illuminated nothing in the walls and
tower windows showed like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness
but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly first one way and then
another a huge ghostly head leering into the night for a moment the three
companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes gollum was
the first to recover again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no
word almost he dragged them forward every step was reluctant and time seemed
to slow its pace so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it
down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge here the road gleaming faintly
passed over the stream in the midst of the valley and went on winding
deviously up towards the citys gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle
of the northward walls wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meads filled with
pale white flowers luminous these were too beautiful and yet horrible of
shape like the demented forms in an uneasy dream and they gave forth a faint
sickening charnel-smell an odour of rottenness filled the air from mead to
mead the bridge sprang figures stood there at its head carven with cunning in
forms human and bestial but all corrupt and loathsome the water flowing
beneath was silent and it steamed but the vapour that rose from it curling
and twisting about the bridge was deadly cold frodo felt his senses reeling
and his mind darkening then suddenly as if some force were at work other than
his own will he began to hurry tottering forward his groping hands held out
his head lolling from side to side both sam and gollum ran after him sam
caught his master in his arms as he stumbled and almost fell right on the
threshold of the bridge
not that way no not that way  whispered gollum but the breath between
his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle and he cowered to
the ground in terror
hold up mr frodo  muttered sam in frodos ear come back not that way
gollum says not and for once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city
on the hill the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire that
was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate at last with an effort
he turned back and as he did so he felt the ring resisting him dragging at
the chain about his neck and his eyes too as he looked away seemed for the
moment to have been blinded the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was already
vanishing into the gloom sam supporting and guiding his stumbling master
followed after him as quickly as he could not far from the near bank of the
stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road through this they
passed and sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at
first as the main road did until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it
faded and went dark winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the
valley
along this path the hobbits trudged side by side unable to see gollum in
front of them except when he turned back to beckon them on then his eyes shone
with a green-white light reflecting the noisome morgul-sheen perhaps or
kindled by some answering mood within of that deadly gleam and of the dark
eyeholes frodo and sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path slowly
they laboured on as they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous
stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer but now their limbs
were deadly tired as if they had walked all night under a burden or had been
swimming long against a heavy tide of water at last they could go no further
without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone they had now climbed up to the top of
a great hump of bare rock ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side and
round the head of this the path went on no more than a wide ledge with a chasm
on the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled
upwards until it disappeared into the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo its heavy on me sam lad very
heavy i wonder how far i can carry it anyway i must rest before we venture on
to that he pointed to the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh  hissed gollum hurrying back to them sssh  his fingers were
on his lips and he shook his head urgently tugging at frodos sleeve he
pointed towards the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not yet weariness and more than weariness oppressed
him it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body i must rest
he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again
hissing behind his hand as if to keep the sound from unseen listeners in the
air not here no not rest here fools eyes can see us when they come to the
bridge they will see us come away climb climb come 
come mr frodo said sam hes right again we cant stay here
all right said frodo in a remote voice as of one speaking half asleep i
will try wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late at that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath
them the great rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in the ground
and echoed in the mountains then with searing suddenness there came a great red
flash far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the
lowering clouds with crimson in that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
seemed unbearably violent and fierce peaks of stone and ridges like notched
knives sprang out in staring black against the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then came a great crack of thunder
and minas morgul answered there was a flare of livid lightnings: forks of
blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into the
sullen clouds the earth groaned and out of the city there came a cry mingled
with harsh high voices as of birds of prey and the shrill neighing of horses
wild with rage and fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly
to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing the hobbits wheeled round
towards it and cast themselves down holding their hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry ended falling back through a long sickening wail to
silence frodo slowly raised his head across the narrow valley now almost on a
level with his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and its cavernous gate
shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide and out of the
gate an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as the night against the wan walls and
the luminous pavement of the road frodo could see them small black figures in
rank upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless
stream before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like ordered
shadows and at their head was one greater than all the rest: a rider all
black save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered
with a perilous light now he was drawing near the bridge below and frodos
staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw surely there was the
lord of the nine riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle
here yes here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand had smitten down the
ring-bearer with his deadly knife the old wound throbbed with pain and a great
chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as with a
spell the rider halted suddenly right before the entrance of the bridge and
behind him all the host stood still there was a pause a dead silence maybe it
was the ring that called to the wraith-lord and for a moment he was troubled
sensing some other power within his valley this way and that turned the dark
head helmed and crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move and as he
waited he felt more urgent than ever before the command that he should put on
the ring but great as the pressure was he felt no inclination now to yield to
it he knew that the ring would only betray him and that he had not even if he
put it on the power to face the morgul-king-not yet there was no longer any
answer to that command in his own will dismayed by terror though it was and he
felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside it took his hand
and as frodo watched with his mind not willing it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old story far away it moved the hand inch by inch towards the
chain upon his neck then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand back
and set it to find another thing a thing lying hidden near his breast cold and
hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of galadriel so long
treasured and almost forgotten till that hour as he touched it for a while
all thought of the ring was banished from his mind he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode across
the bridge and all his dark host followed him maybe the elven-hoods defied his
unseen eyes and the mind of his small enemy being strengthened had turned
aside his thought but he was in haste already the hour had struck and at his
great masters bidding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down the winding road and
behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge so great an army had never
issued from that vale since the days of isildurs might no host so fell and
strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of anduin and yet it was but one and
not the greatest of the hosts that mordor now sent forth
frodo stirred and suddenly his heart went out to faramir the storm has
burst at last he thought this great array of spears and swords is going to
osgiliath will faramir get across in time he guessed it but did he know the
hour and who can now hold the fords when the king of the nine riders comes and
other armies will come i am too late all is lost i tarried on the way all is
lost even if my errand is performed no one will ever know there will be no
one i can tell it will be in vain overcome with weakness he wept and still
the host of morgul crossed the bridge
then at a great distance as if it came out of memories of the shire some
sunlit early morning when the day called and doors were opening he heard sams
voice speaking wake up mr frodo wake up  had the voice added: your
breakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised certainly sam was
urgent wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang the gates of minas morgul had closed the last rank
of spears had vanished down the road the tower still grinned across the valley
but the light was fading in it the whole city was falling back into a dark
brooding shade and silence yet still it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre gone and wed better go too theres something
still alive in that place something with eyes or a seeing mind if you take
me and the longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us come
on mr frodo 
frodo raised his head and then stood up despair had not left him but the
weakness had passed he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a moment
before he had felt the opposite that what he had to do he had to do if he
could and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf or
anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose he took his staff in one
hand and the phial in his other when he saw that the clear light was already
welling through his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his
heart then turning from the city of morgul now no more than a grey glimmer
across a dark gulf he prepared to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond
when the gates of minas morgul opened leaving the hobbits where they lay he
now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping foolish
silly  he hissed make haste they mustnt think danger has passed it
hasnt make haste 
they did not answer but they followed him on to the climbing ledge it was
little to the liking of either of them not even after facing so many other
perils but it did not last long soon the path reached a rounded angle where
the mountain-side swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a narrow
opening in the rock they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complete and they could see nothing much beyond their
hands stretch but gollums eyes shone pale several feet above as he turned
back towards them
careful  he whispered steps lots of steps must be careful 
care was certainly needed frodo and sam at first felt easier having now a
wall on either side but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder and as
they climbed up and up they became more and more aware of the long black fall
behind them and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous:
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some were broken and some cracked
as foot was set upon them the hobbits struggled on until at last they were
clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead and forcing their aching
knees to bend and straighten and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the
sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads
at length just as they felt that they could endure no more they saw
gollums eyes peering down at them again were up he whispered first
stairs past clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits just a few
more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following him crawled up the last step
and sat down rubbing their legs and knees they were in a deep dark passage that
seemed still to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let them rest long
theres another stair still he said much longer stair rest when we get
to the top of next stair not yet
sam groaned longer did you say  he asked
yes yess longer said gollum but not so difficult hobbits have climbed
the straight stair next comes the winding stair
and what after that  said sam
we shall see said gollum softly o yes we shall see 
i thought you said there was a tunnel said sam isnt there a tunnel or
something to go through 
o yes theres a tunnel said gollum but hobbits can rest before they try
that if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top very nearly if
they get through o yes 
frodo shivered the climb had made him sweat but now he felt cold and
clammy and there was a chill draught in the dark passage blowing down from the
invisible heights above he got up and shook himself well lets go on  he
said this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for miles and always the chill air flowed over
them rising as they went on to a bitter wind the mountains seemed to be trying
with their deadly breath to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets of
the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind they only knew
that they had come to the end when suddenly they felt no wall at their right
hand they could see very little great black shapeless masses and deep grey
shadows loomed above them and about them but now and again a dull red light
flickered up under the lowering clouds and for a moment they were aware of tall
peaks in front and on either side like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof
they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet on to a wide shelf a
cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right
gollum led the way close under the cliff for the present they were no longer
climbing but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark and
there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way their going was slow and
cautious how many hours had passed since they had entered the morgul vale
neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess the night seemed endless
at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up and once more a
stairway opened before them again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway did not delve into the
mountain-side here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path like a
snake wound to and fro across it at one point it crawled sideways right to the
edge of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit
the great ravine at the head of the morgul valley down in its depths glimmered
like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the dead city to the nameless pass
he turned hastily away
still on and up the stairway bent and crawled until at last with a final
flight short and straight it climbed out again on to another level the path
had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine and it now followed its
own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft
among the higher regions of the ephel dúath dimly the hobbits could
discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side between which
were great crevices and fissures blacker than the night where forgotten winters
had gnawed and carved the sunless stone and now the red light in the sky
seemed stronger though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they saw only the flame of
some great violence of sauron in the torment of gorgoroth beyond still far
ahead and still high above frodo looking up saw as he guessed the very
crown of this bitter road against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep-cloven between two black
shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively the horn upon the left was tall and
slender and in it burned a red light or else the red light in the land beyond
was shining through a hole he saw now: it was a black tower poised above the
outer pass he touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that  said sam so this secret way of yours is
guarded after all he growled turning to gollum as you knew all along i
suppose 
all ways are watched yes said gollum of course they are but hobbits
must try some way this may be least watched perhaps theyve all gone away to
big battle perhaps 
perhaps grunted sam well it still seems a long way off and a long way
up before we get there and theres still the tunnel i think you ought to rest
now mr frodo i dont know what time of day or night it is but weve kept
going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo let us find some corner out of the wind
and gather our strength-for the last lap for so he felt it to be the terrors
of the land beyond and the deed to be done there seemed remote too far off
yet to trouble him all his mind was bent on getting through or over this
impenetrable wall and guard if once he could do that impossible thing then
somehow the errand would be accomplished or so it seemed to him in that dark
hour of weariness still labouring in the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: frodo and
sam a little way within and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they
went down into the nameless land maybe the last meal they would ever eat
together some of the food of gondor they ate and wafers of the waybread of the
elves and they drank a little but of their water they were sparing and took
only enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water again  said sam but i suppose even over
there they drink orcs drink dont they 
yes they drink said frodo but do not let us speak of that such drink
is not for us
then all the more need to fill our bottles said sam but there isnt any
water up here: not a sound or a trickle have i heard and anyway faramir said we
were not to drink any water in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad morgul were his words said frodo we are
not in that valley now and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst theres a
wicked feeling about this place he sniffed and a smell i fancy do you
notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy i dont like it
i dont like anything here at all said frodo step or stone breath or
bone earth air and water all seem accursed but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it before we started but i suppose its often that way the brave
things in the old tales and songs mr frodo: adventures as i used to call
them i used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories
went out and looked for because they wanted them because they were exciting
and life was a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say but thats not the
way of it with the tales that really mattered or the ones that stay in the
mind folk seem to have been just landed in them usually - their paths were
laid that way as you put it but i expect they had lots of chances like us of
turning back only they didnt and if they had we shouldnt know because
theyd have been forgotten we hear about those as just went on - and not all to
a good end mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside
it call a good end you know coming home and finding things all right though
not quite the same - like old mr bilbo but those arent always the best tales
to hear though they may be the best tales to get landed in i wonder what sort
of a tale weve fallen into 
i wonder said frodo but i dont know and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that youre fond of you may know or guess what kind of a tale it
is happy-ending or sad-ending but the people in it dont know and you dont
want them to
no sir of course not beren now he never thought he was going to get that
silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet he did and that was a
worse place and a blacker danger than ours but thats
a long tale of course and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond
it - and the silmaril went on and came to eärendil and why sir i never
thought of that before weve got - youve got some of the light of it in that
star-glass that the lady gave you why to think of it were in the same
tale still its going on dont the great tales never end 
no they never end as tales said frodo but the people in them come and
go when their parts ended our part will end later - or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam he laughed grimly
and i mean just that mr frodo i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and
waking up to a mornings work in the garden im afraid thats all im hoping
for all the time all the big important plans are not for my sort still i
wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales were in one or course but
i mean: put into words you know told by the fireside or read out of a great
big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards and people will
say: "lets hear about frodo and the ring " and theyll say:
"yes thats one of my favourite stories frodo was very brave wasnt he
dad" "yes my boy the famousest of the hobbits and thats saying a
lot"
its saying a lot too much said frodo and he laughed a long clear laugh
from his heart such a sound had not been heard in those places since sauron
came to middle-earth to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were
listening and the tall rocks leaning over them but frodo did not heed them he
laughed again why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if
the story was already written but youve left out one of the chief characters:
samwise the stouthearted "i want to hear more about sam dad why didnt
they put in more of his talk dad thats what i like it makes me laugh and
frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he dad " 
now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun i was serious 
so was i said frodo and so i am were going on a bit too fast you and
i sam are still stuck in the worst places of the story and it is all too
likely that some will say at this point: "shut the book now dad we dont
want to read any more" 
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be one to say that things done and over
and made into part of the great tales are different why even gollum might be
good in a tale better than he is to have by you anyway and he used to like
tales himself once by his own account i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or
the villain
gollum he called would you like to be the hero - now wheres he got to
again
there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows
near he had refused their food though he had as usual accepted a mouthful of
water and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: they had supposed that one
at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day before had been to hunt
for food to his own liking and now he had evidently slipped off again while
they talked but what for this time
i dont like his sneaking off without saying said sam and least of all
now he cant be looking for food up here not unless theres some kind of rock
he fancies why there isnt even a bit of moss 
its no good worrying about him now said frodo we couldnt have got so
far not even within sight of the pass without him and so well have to put up
with his ways if hes false hes false
all the same id rather have him under my eye said sam all the more so
if hes false do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or
no and now we see a tower there - and it may be deserted and it may not do
you think hes gone to fetch them orcs or whatever they are
no i dont think so answered frodo even if hes up to some wickedness
and i suppose thats not unlikely i dont think its that: not to fetch orcs
or any servants of the enemy why wait till now and go through all the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he fears he could probably have
betrayed us to orcs many times since we met him no if its anything it will
be some little private trick of his own-that he thinks is quite secret
well i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam not that it comforts me
mightily i dont make no mistake: i dont doubt hed hand me over to
orcs as gladly as kiss his hand but i was forgetting - his precious no i
suppose the whole time its been the precious
for poor sméagol thats the one idea in all his little
schemes if he has any but how bringing us up here will help him in that is
more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo and i dont think hes got
just one plain scheme in his muddled head i think he really is in part trying
to save the precious from the enemy as long as he can for that would be the
last disaster for himself too if the enemy got it and in the other part
perhaps hes just biding his time and waiting on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before said sam but the nearer
they get to the enemys land the more like stinker slinker will get mark my
words: if ever we get to the pass he wont let us really take the precious
thing over the border without making some kind of trouble
we havent got there yet said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do if were caught
napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick not but what it would be
safe for you to have a wink now master safe if you lay close to me id be
dearly glad to see you have a sleep id keep watch over you and anyway if you
lay near with my arm round you no one could come pawing you without your sam
knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighed as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of
cool green yes even here i could sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he returned crawling and creeping
down the path out of the gloom ahead sam sat propped against the stone his
head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy in his lap lay frodos head
drowned deep in sleep upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands and
the other lay softly upon his masters breast peace was in both their faces
gollum looked at them a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim and grey old and tired a
spasm of pain seemed to twist him and he turned away peering back up towards
the pass shaking his head as if engaged in some interior debate then he came
back and slowly putting out a trembling hand very cautiously he touched
frodos knee - but almost the touch was a caress for a fleeting moment could
one of the sleepers have seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his
time beyond friends and kin and the fields and streams of youth an old
starved pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep and
immediately sam was wide awake the first thing he saw was gollum - pawing at
master as he thought
hey you he said roughly what are you up to
nothing nothing said gollum softly nice master
i daresay said sam but where have you been to - sneaking off and
sneaking back you old villain 
gollum withdrew himself and a green glint flickered under his heavy lids
almost spider-like he looked now crouched back on his bent limbs with his
protruding eyes the fleeting moment had passed beyond
recall sneaking sneaking he hissed hobbits always so polite yes o nice
hobbits sméagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he guides them and he searches for
paths and they say sneak sneak very nice friends o yes my
precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful sorry he said im
sorry but you startled me out of my sleep and i shouldnt have been sleeping
and that made me a bit sharp but mr frodo hes that tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is sorry but where have you been
to 
sneaking said gollum and the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way i dont suppose its so far
from the truth and now wed better all be sneaking along together whats the
time is it today or tomorrow 
its tomorrow said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to
sleep very foolish very dangerous-if poor sméagol wasnt sneaking
about to watch
i think we shall get tired of that word soon said sam but never mind
ill wake master up gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow and
bending down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up 
frodo stirred and opened his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bending over
him calling me early arent you sam he said its dark still 
yes its always dark here said sam but gollums come back mr frodo and
he says its tomorrow so we must be walking on the last lap
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up the last lap  he said hullo sméagol
found any food have you had any rest 
no food no rest nothing for sméagol said gollum hes a sneak
sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself sméagol said frodo its unwise
whether they are true or false
sméagol has to take whats given him answered gollum he was given
that name by kind master samwise the hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam yes sir he said i did use the word waking up out
of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand i said i was sorry but i
soon shant be
come let it pass then said frodo but now we seem to have come to the
point you and i sméagol tell me can we find the rest of the
way by ourselves were in sight of the pass of a way in and if we can find it
now then i suppose our agreement can be said to be over you have done what you
promised and youre free: free to go back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy and one day i may reward you i or those
that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined o no they cant find the way themselves
can they o no indeed theres the tunnel coming sméagol must go
on no rest no food not yet
 
it may indeed have been daytime now as gollum said but the hobbits could
see little difference unless perhaps the heavy sky above was less utterly
black more like a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness of deep
night which lingered still in cracks and holes a grey blurring shadow shrouded
the stony world about them they passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and
weathered rock standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand there was no
sound some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a great grey wall a last huge
upthrusting mass of mountain-stone darker it loomed and steadily it rose as
they approached until it towered up high above them shutting out the view of
all that lay beyond deep shadow lay before its feet sam sniffed the air
ugh that smell he said its getting stronger and stronger
presently they were under the shadow and there in the midst of it they saw
the opening of a cave this is the way in said gollum softly this is the
entrance to the tunnel he did not speak its name: torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of morgul
but a foul reek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark
within
is this the only way sméagol  said frodo
yes yes he answered yes we must go this way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said sam phew but
perhaps you dont mind bad smells
gollums eyes glinted he doesnt know what we minds does he precious no
he doesnt but sméagol can bear things yes hes been through o yes
right through its the only way
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam its like - well i wouldnt
like to say some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a hundred years
of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or no if its the only way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside in a few steps they were in utter
and impenetrable dark not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser there
there were airs moving and echoes and a sense of space here the air was
still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead they walked as it were in a black
vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that as it was breathed brought
blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind so that even the memory of
colours and of forms and of any light faded out of thought night always had
been and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feel and indeed the senses of their feet
and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully the walls felt to their
surprise smooth and the floor save for a step now and again was straight and
even going ever up at the same stiff slope the tunnel was high and wide so
wide that though the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side-walls with
their outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead while they
were still able to give heed to such things they could hear his breath hissing
and gasping just in front of them but after a time their senses became duller
both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on groping walking
on and on mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered will to
go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and distance soon passed out
of his reckoning sam on the right feeling the wall was aware that there was
an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less
heavy and then they passed it by
theres more than one passage here he whispered with an effort: it seemed
hard to make his breath give any sound its as orc-like a place as ever there
could be 
after that first he on the right and then frodo on the left passed three
or four such openings some wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt
of the main way for it was straight and did not turn and still went steadily
up but how long was it how much more of this would they have to endure or
could they endure the breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed
and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker
than the foul air as they thrust forward they felt things brush against their
heads or against their hands long tentacles or hanging growths perhaps: they
could not tell what they were and still the stench grew it grew until almost
it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them and that was
for their torment one hour two hours three hours: how many had they passed in
this lightless hole hours-days weeks rather sam left the tunnel-side and
shrank towards frodo and their hands met and clasped and so together they
still went on
at length frodo groping along the left-hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sideways into the emptiness here was some opening in the rock
far wider than any they had yet passed and out of it came a reek so foul and a
sense of lurking malice so intense that frodo reeled and at that moment sam
too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fear frodo gripped sams hand up 
he said in a hoarse breath without voice it all comes from here the stench
and the peril now for it quick 
calling up his remaining strength and resolution he dragged sam to his feet
and forced his own limbs to move sam stumbled beside him one step two steps
three steps-at last six steps maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen
opening but whether that was so or not suddenly it was easier to move as if
some hostile will for the moment had released them they struggled on still
hand in hand
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty the tunnel forked or so it
seemed and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way or which
kept nearer to the straight which should they take the left or the right
they knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice would almost certainly be
fatal
which way has gollum gone  panted sam and why didnt he wait 
sméagol  said frodo trying to call sméagol  but his
voice croaked and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips there was no
answer not an echo not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this time i fancy muttered sam i guess this is just
exactly where he meant to bring us gollum if ever i lay hands on you again
youll be sorry for it
presently groping and fumbling in the dark they found that the opening on
the left was blocked: either it was a blind or else some great stone had fallen
in the passage this cant be the way frodo whispered right or wrong we
must take the other
and quick  sam panted theres something worse than gollum about i can
feel something looking at us
they had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound
startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling bubbling noise
and a long venomous hiss they wheeled round but nothing could be seen still
as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword and
as he did so he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came i wish
old tom was near us now he thought then as he stood darkness about him and a
blackness of despair and anger in his heart it seemed to him that he saw a
light: a light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first as a sun-ray to
the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit then the light became colour:
green gold silver white far off as in a little picture drawn by
elven-fingers he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in lórien
and gifts were in her hands and you ring-bearer he heard her
say remote but clear for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creaking as of some great
jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark a reek came on before
it master master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his
voice the ladys gift the star-glass a light to you in dark places she said
it was to be the star-glass
the star-glass muttered frodo as one answering out of sleep hardly
comprehending why yes why had i forgotten it a light when all other
lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly he held aloft the phial of
galadriel for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star struggling in heavy
earthward mists and then as its power waxed and hope grew in frodos
mind it began to burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart of
dazzling light as though eärendil had himself come down from the high
sunset paths with the last silmaril upon his brow the darkness receded from it
until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long carried
not guessing its full worth and potency seldom had he remembered it on the
road until they came to morgul vale and never had he used it for fear of its
revealing light aiya eärendil elenion
ancalima he cried and knew not what he had spoken for it seemed
that another voice spoke through his clear untroubled by the foul air of the
pit
but other potencies there are in middle-earth powers of night and they are
old and strong and she that walked in the darkness had heard the elves cry that
cry far back in the deeps of time and she had not heeded it and it did not
daunt her now even as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent upon him and a
deadly regard considering him not far down the tunnel between them and the
opening where they had reeled and stumbled he was aware of eyes growing
visible two great clusters of many-windowed eyes - the coming menace was
unmasked at last the radiance of the star-glass was broken and thrown back from
their thousand facets but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily
to glow within a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil thought monstrous and
abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled with purpose and with hideous
delight gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam horror-stricken began slowly to back away their own gaze
held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes but as they backed so the eyes
advanced frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped then suddenly
released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain panic for the
amusement of the eyes they both turned and fled together but even as they ran
frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up
behind the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand  he cried desperately running is no use
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel  he called and gathering his courage he lifted up the phial
once more the eyes halted for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint
of doubt troubled them then frodos heart flamed within him and without
thinking what he did whether it was folly or despair or courage he took the
phial in his left hand and with his right hand drew his sword sting flashed
out and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light but at its edges a
blue fire flicked then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
they wavered doubt came into them as the light approached one by one they
dimmed and slowly they drew back no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted
them before from sun and moon and star they had been safe underground but now
a star had descended into the very earth still it approached and the eyes
began to quail one by one they all went dark they turned away and a great
bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its huge shadow in between they were
gone
master master cried sam he was close behind his own sword drawn and
ready stars and glory but the elves would make a song of that if ever they
heard of it and may i live to tell them and hear them sing but dont go on
master dont go down to that den nows our only chance now lets get out of
this foul hole
and so back they turned once more first walking and then running for as
they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply and with every stride they
climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair and strength returned to
limb and heart but still the hatred of the watcher lurked behind them blind
for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death and now there came a
flow of air to meet them cold and thin the opening the tunnels end at last
it was before them panting yearning for a roofless place they flung
themselves forward and then in amazement they staggered tumbling back the
outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of stone: soft and a little
yielding it seemed and yet strong and impervious air filtered through hut not
a glimmer of any light once more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness which
the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce and did not illuminate as if it
were a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissipate across the
width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun orderly as the web of some
huge spider but denser-woven and far greater and each thread was as thick as
rope
sam laughed grimly cobwebs  he said is that all cobwebs but what a
spider have at em down with em 
in a fury he hewed at them with his sword but the thread that he struck did
not break it gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring
turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm three times sam struck with
all his force and at last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the air one end of it lashed sams
hand and he cried out in pain starting back and drawing his hand across his
mouth
it will take days to clear the road like this he said whats to be done
have those eyes come back 
no not to be seen said frodo but i still feel that they are looking at
me or thinking about me: making some other plan perhaps if this light were
lowered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped in the end  said sam bitterly his anger rising again above
weariness and despair gnats in a net may the curse of faramir bite that
gollum and bite him quick 
that would not help us now said frodo come let us see what sting can
do it is an elven-blade there were webs of horror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star-glass do not be afraid hold it up and watch
then frodo stepped up to the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of close-strung
cords and at once springing away the blue-gleaming blade shore through them
like a scythe through grass and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose a
great rent was made
stroke after stroke he dealt until at last all the web within his reach was
shattered and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil in the
incoming wind the trap was broken
come  cried frodo on on  wild joy at their escape from the very mouth
of despair suddenly filled all his mind his head whirled as with a draught of
potent wine he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through the den
of night the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the last hours of a
sombre day were passing the red glare of mordor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope almost he
had reached the summit of the wall only a little higher now the cleft cirith
ungol was before him a dim notch in the black ridge and the horns of rock
darkling in the sky on either side a short race a sprinters course and he
would be through
the pass sam  he cried not heeding the shrillness of his voice that
released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild the
pass run run and well be through-through before any one can stop us 
sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs but glad as he was to
be free he was uneasy and as he ran he kept on glancing back at the dark arch
of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or some shape beyond his imagining spring
out in pursuit too little did he or his master know of the craft of shelob she
had many exits from her lair
there agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider-form even such as once
of old had lived in the land of the elves in the west that is now under the sea
such as beren fought in the mountains of terror in doriath and so came to lúthien
upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago how shelob
came there flying from ruin no tale tells for out of the dark years few tales
have come but still she was there who was there before sauron and before the
first stone of barad-dûr and she served none but herself drinking
the blood of elves and men bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her
feasts weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her food and her
vomit darkness far and wide her lesser broods bastards of the miserable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen to glen from the
ephel dúath to the eastern hills to dol guldur and the fastnesses of
mirkwood but none could rival her shelob the great last child of ungoliant to
trouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her sméagol who pried into
all dark holes and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her and the
darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off from light and from regret and he had promised to
bring her food but her lust was not his lust little she knew of or cared for
towers or rings or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired death
for all others mind and body and for herself a glut of life alone swollen
till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the darkness could not
contain her
but that desire was yet far away and long now had she been hungry lurking
in her den while the power of sauron grew and light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead and no elf or man came near
only the unhappy orcs poor food and wary but she must eat and however busily
they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever she
found some way to snare them but she lusted for sweeter meat and gollum had
brought it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when the evil mood was on
him as he walked the dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it may well be that when she
throws away the bones and the empty garments we shall find it we shall get it
the precious a reward for poor sméagol who brings nice food and well
save the precious as we promised o yes and when weve got it safe
then shell know it o yes then well pay her back my precious then well pay
everyone back 
so he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning which he still hoped to
hide from her even when he had come to her again and had bowed low before her
while his companions slept
and as for sauron: he knew where she lurked it pleased him that she should
dwell there hungry but unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised and orcs
they were useful slaves but he had them in plenty if now and again shelob
caught them to stay her appetite she was welcome: he could spare them and
sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat his cat he calls her
but she owns him not sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better uses
for: he would have them driven to her hole and report brought back to him of
the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own devices and feared no assault
nor wrath nor any end of their wickedness never yet had any fly escaped from
shelobs webs and the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did poor sam
know except that a fear was growing on him a menace which he could not see
and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him to run and his feet
seemed leaden
dread was round him and enemies before him in the pass and his master was
in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them turning his eyes away from the
shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
ahead and he saw two things that increased his dismay he saw that the sword
which frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue flame and he saw
that though the sky behind was now dark still the window in the tower was
glowing red
orcs  he muttered well never rush it like this theres orcs about and
worse than orcs then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy he closed
his hand about the precious phial which he still bore red with his own living
blood his hand shone for a moment and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven-cloak about him now he tried
to quicken his pace his master was gaining on him already he was some twenty
strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he would be lost to sight in that
grey world
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came a little way
ahead and to his left he saw suddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under
the cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld horrible beyond the
horror of an evil dream most like a spider she was but huger than the great
hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her
remorseless eyes those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated
there they were lit with a fell light again clustering in her out-thrust head
great horns she had and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen
body a vast bloated bag swaying and sagging between her legs its great bulk
was black blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath was pale and
luminous and gave forth a stench her legs were bent with great knobbed joints
high above her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines and at each
legs end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out
of the upper exit from her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running on
her creaking legs now making a sudden bound she was between sam and his
master either she did not see sam or she avoided him for the moment as the
bearer of the light and fixed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of his phial running heedless up the path unaware yet of his peril swiftly he
ran but shelob was swifter in a few leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout look out behind
 he yelled look out master im - but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck
while something wrapped itself about his leg taken off his guard he toppled
backwards into the arms of his attacker
got him  hissed gollum in his ear at last my precious weve got him
yes the nassty hobbit we takes this one shell
get the other o yes shelob will get him not sméagol: he promised he
wont hurt master at all but hes got you you nassty filthy little
sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the delay when his master was in
deadly peril gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond
anything that gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he thought
him not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely his
hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked and lunged forward again trying to
tear away from the grip on his neck his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs staff desperately he tried to
turn and stab his enemy but gollum was too quick his long right arm shot out
and he grabbed sams wrist: his fingers were like a vice slowly and
relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward till with a cry of pain sam
released the sword and it fell to the ground and all the while gollums other
hand was tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick with all his strength he pulled away and got
his feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and
with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum fell over with sam on
top and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach a sharp
hiss came out of him and for a second his hand upon sams throat loosened but
his fingers still gripped the sword-hand sam tore himself forward and away and
stood up and then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on the wrist
held by gollum laying hold of the staff with his left hand sam swung it up
and down it came with a whistling crack on gollums outstretched arm just below
the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go then sam waded in not waiting to change the
staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow quick as a snake gollum
slithered aside and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back the
staff cracked and broke that was enough for him grabbing from behind was an
old game of his and seldom had he failed in it but this time misled by spite
he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his
victims neck everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness and now he was face
to face with a furious enemy little less than his own size this fight was not
for him sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it gollum squealed
and springing aside on to all fours he jumped away in one big bound like a
frog before sam could reach him he was off running with amazing speed back
towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him for the moment he had forgotten everything
else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill gollum but before he
could overtake him gollum was gone then as the dark hole stood before him and
the stench came out to meet him like a clap of thunder the thought of frodo and
the monster smote upon sams mind he spun round and rushed wildly up the path
calling and calling his masters name he was too late so far gollums plot had
succeeded
 
frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over
him so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of sam and his cries until
he was close at hand as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already bound in
cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder and the monster with her great
forelegs was beginning half to lift half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the ground his elven-blade where
it had fallen useless from his grasp sam did not wait to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage he sprang forward
with a yell and seized his masters sword in his left hand then he charged no
onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts where some
desperate small creature armed with little teeth alone will spring upon a tower
of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned
slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him but almost before she was
aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw sam sprang
in inside the arches of her legs and with a quick upthrust of his other hand
stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature was right under her for the moment out of the
reach of her sting and of her claws her vast belly was above him with its
putrid light and the stench of it almost smote him down still his fury held
for one more blow and before she could sink upon him smothering him and all
his little impudence of courage he slashed the bright elven-blade across her
with desperate strength
but shelob was not as dragons are no softer spot had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide but ever thickened from
within with layer on layer of evil growth the blade scored it with a dreadful
gash but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men not
though elf or dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of beren or of túrin
wield it she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the great bag of her
belly high above sams head poison frothed and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again too soon for
sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his own sword with both hands he
held the elven-blade point upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so
shelob with the driving force of her own cruel will with strength greater than
any warriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike deep deep it pricked
as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of knowing in all her long
world of wickedness not the doughtiest soldier of old gondor nor the most
savage orc entrapped had ever thus endured her or set blade to her beloved
flesh a shudder went through her heaving up again wrenching away from the
pain she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a
convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos head his senses reeling in the foul
stench his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword through the mist
before his eyes he was aware dimly of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to
master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him slowly he
raised his head and saw her only a few paces away eyeing him her beak
drabbling a spittle of venom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded
eye there she crouched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground the great
bows of her legs quivering as she gathered herself for another spring-this time
to crush and sting to death: no little bite of poison to still the struggling of
her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even as sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his death in her eyes a
thought came to him as if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in his
breast with his left hand and found what he sought: cold and hard and solid it
seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel  he said faintly and then he heard voices far off but clear:
the crying of the elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of
the shire and the music of the elves as it came through his sleep in the hall
of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth
and then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did
not know:
a elbereth gilthoniel

o menel palan-diriel

le nallon sí dinguruthos

a tiro nin fanuilos
and with that he staggered to his feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts
son again
now come you filth he cried youve hurt my master you brute and
youll pay for it were going on but well settle with you first come on and
taste it again
as if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a white torch in his hand it flamed like a star that leaping from
the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light no such terror out of
heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before the beams of it entered into her
wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light spread from eye to eye she fell back beating the air with her forelegs
her sight blasted by inner lightnings her mind in agony then turning her
maimed head away she rolled aside and began to crawl claw by claw towards the
opening in the dark cliff behind
sam came on he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on and shelob
cowed at last shrunken in defeat jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten
from him she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail of
green-yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed a last stroke at her
dragging legs then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her lair nursing her malice and
her misery and in slow years of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding
her clustered eyes until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreadful
snares in the glens of the mountains of shadow this tale does not tell
sam was left alone wearily as the evening of the nameless land fell upon
the place of battle he crawled back to his master
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak as he had run
forward eager rejoicing to be free shelob with hideous speed had come behind
and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck he lay now pale and heard
no voice and did not move
master dear master  said sam and through a long silence waited
listening in vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head
upon frodos breast and to his mouth but no stir of life could he find nor
feel the faintest flutter of the heart often he chafed his masters hands and
feet and touched his brow but all were cold
frodo mr frodo  he called dont leave me here alone its your sam
calling dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo o wake up frodo me
dear me dear wake up
then anger surged over hint and he ran about his masters body in a rage
stabbing the air and smiting the stones and shouting challenges presently he
came back and bending looked at frodos face pale
beneath him in the dusk and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was
revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel in lórien: frodo with a pale
face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff or fast asleep he had thought
then hes dead  he said not asleep dead  and as he said it as
if the words had set the venom to its work again it seemed to him that the hue
of the face grew livid green
and then black despair came down on him and sam bowed to the ground and
drew his grey hood over his head and night came into his heart and he knew no
more
when at last the blackness passed sam looked up and shadows were about him
but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he could not
tell he was still in the same place and still his master lay beside him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do  he said did i come all this way with
him for nothing  and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at
the time he did not understand himself at the beginning of their journey: i
have something to do before the end i must see it through sir if you
understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead unburied on the top of the
mountains and go home or go on go on he repeated and for a moment doubt
and fear shook him go on is that what ive got to do and leave him
then at last he began to weep and going to frodo he composed his body and
folded his cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about him and he
laid his own sword at one side and the staff that faramir had given at the
other
if im to go on he said then i must take your sword by your leave mr
frodo but ill put this one to lie by you as it lay by the old king in the
barrow and youve got your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo and your
star-glass mr frodo you did lend it to me and ill need it for ill be
always in the dark now its too good for me and the lady gave it to you but
maybe shed understand do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet he knelt and held frodos hand and could not
release it and time went by and still he knelt holding his masters hand and
in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely journey
- for vengeance if once he could go his anger would bear him down all the
roads of the world pursuing until he had him at last: gollum then gollum
would die in a corner but that was not what he had set out to do it would not
be worth while to leave his master for that it would not bring him back
nothing would they had better both be dead together and that too would be a
lonely journey
he looked on the bright point of the sword he thought of the places behind
where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness there was no
escape that way that was to do nothing not even to grieve that was not what
he had set out to do what am i to do then  he cried again and now he seemed
plainly to know the hard answer: see it through another lonely journey
and the worst
what me alone go to the crack of doom and all  he quailed still but
the resolve grew what me take the ring from him the council
gave it to him
but the answer came at once: and the council gave him companions so that
the errand should not fail and you are the last of all the company the errand
must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned i wish old gandalf was hare or
somebody why am i left all alone to make up my mind im sure to go wrong and
its not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yourself forward youve been put forward and as for
not being the right and proper person why mr frodo wasnt as you might say
nor mr bilbo they didnt choose themselves
ah well i must make up my own mind i will make it up but ill be sure to
go wrong: thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now: if were found here or mr frodos found and that things
on him well the enemy will get it and thats the end of all of us of lorien
and rivendell and the shire and all and there s no time to lose or itll be
the end anyway the wars begun and more than likely things are all going the
enemys way already no chance to go back with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me over masters body and gets it: or
take it and go he drew a deep breath then take it it is 
he stooped very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand
inside frodos tunic then with his other hand raising the head he kissed the
cold forehead and softly drew the chain over it and then the head lay quietly
back again in rest no change came over the still face and by that more than by
all other tokens sam was convinced at last that frodo had died and laid aside
the quest
good-bye master my dear  he murmured forgive your sam hell come back
to this spot when the jobs done - if he manages it and then hell not leave
you again rest you quiet till i come and may no foul creature come anigh you
and if the lady could hear me and give me one wish i would wish to come back
and find you again good-bye 
and then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it and at once his head
was bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring as if a great stone had
been strung on him but slowly as if the weight became less or new strength
grew in him he raised his head and then with a great effort got to his feet
and found that he could walk and bear his burden and for a moment he lifted up
the phial and looked down at his master and the light burned gently now with
the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer and in that light frodos face
was fair of hue again pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty as of one who
has long passed the shadows and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark
he had not far to go the tunnel was some way behind the cleft a couple of
hundred yards ahead or less the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut worn
in ages of passage running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either
side the trough narrowed rapidly soon sam came to a long flight of broad
shallow steps now the orc-tower was right above him frowning black and in it
the red eye glowed now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it he was coming
to the top of the steps and was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself but he had not though he
had done his best to think it out what he was doing was altogether against the
grain of his nature have i got it wrong  he muttered what ought i to have
done 
as the sheer sides of the cleft closed about him before he reached the
actual summit before he looked at last on the path descending into the nameless
land he turned for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the gathering gloom the mouth of the
tunnel and he thought he could see or guess where frodo lay he fancied there
was a glimmer on the ground down there or perhaps it was some trick of his
tears as he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen
in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish he sighed to go back and find
him  then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps: the
heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few more and he would be going down and
would never see that high place again and then suddenly he heard cries and
voices he stood still as stone orc-voices they were behind him and before
him a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: orcs were coming up to the cleft
from the far side from some entry to the tower perhaps tramping feet and
shouts behind he wheeled round he saw small red lights torches winking away
below there as they issued from the tunnel at last the hunt was up the red eye
of the tower had not been blind he was caught
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was very
near in a minute they would reach the top and be on him he had taken too long
in making up his mind and now it was no good how could he escape or save
himself or save the ring the ring he was not aware of any thought or
decision he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the ring in
his hand the head of the orc-company appeared in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was filled with an hour of
thought at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed
but otherwise than in shelobs lair all things about him now were not dark but
vague while he himself was there in a grey hazy world alone like a small
black solid rock and the ring weighing down his left hand was like an orb of
hot gold he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and uniquely visible
and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him
he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of water far off in morgul vale
and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices in the dungeons of the tower and the cries of
the orcs as they came out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears the
crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him he shrank
against the cliff but they marched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands and they
passed him by he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide
he listened the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had
sighted one another and both parties were now hurrying and shouting he heard
them both clearly and he understood what they said perhaps the ring gave
understanding of tongues or simply understanding especially of the servants of
sauron its maker so that if he gave heed he understood and translated the
thought to himself certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it
approached the places of its forging but one thing it did not confer and that
was courage at present sam still thought only of hiding of lying low till all
was quiet again and he listened anxiously he could not tell how near the
voices were the words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough of war already 
orders you lubber and what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down to fight 
orders to you im in command of this pass so speak civil whats your
report 
nothing
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders the orcs
lower down had suddenly seen something they began to run so did the others
hai hola heres something lying right in the road a spy a spy  there
was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood they had seen
his master what would they do he had heard tales of the orcs to make the blood
run cold it could not be borne he sprang up he flung the quest and all his
decisions away and fear and doubt with them he knew now where his place was
and had been: at his masters side though what he could do there was not clear
back he ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
how many are there he thought thirty or forty from the tower at least
and a lot more than that from down below i guess how many can i kill before
they get me theyll see the flame of the sword as soon as i draw it and
theyll get me sooner or later i wonder if any song will ever mention it: how
samwise fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodies round his master no no
song of course not for the ringll be found and therell be no more songs i
cant help it my place is by mr frodo they must understand that - elrond and
the council and the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom their plans
have gone wrong i cant be their ring-bearer not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now he had had no time to consider
himself but now he realized that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion: his
legs would not carry him as he wished he was too slow the path seemed miles
long where had they all got to in the mist
there they were again a good way ahead still a cluster of figures round
something lying on the ground a few seemed to be darting this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail he tried to make a spurt
come on sam  he said or youll be too late again he loosened the
sword in its sheath in a minute he would draw it and then-
there was a wild clamour hooting and laughing as something was lifted from
the ground ya hoi ya harri hoi up up 
then a voice shouted: now off the quick way back to the undergate shell
not trouble us tonight by all the signs the whole band of orc-figures began to
move four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders ya hoi

they had taken frodos body they were off he could not catch them up still
he laboured on the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in those with the
burden went first and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and
jostling sam came on he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his wavering
hand but they did not see it even as he came panting up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast then he drew his sleeve
across his face wiping away the grime and sweat and tears curse the filth
 he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel rather it was as if he
had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog his weariness was growing but
his will hardened all the more he thought he could see the light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up orcs go fast
in tunnels and this tunnel they knew well for in spite of shelob they were
forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the
mountains in what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been
made where shelob had taken up her abode in ages past they did not know: but
many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side so as to escape
the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters tonight
they did not intend to go far down but were hastening to find a side-passage
that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff must of them were gleeful
delighted with what they had found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and
yammered after the fashion of their kind sam heard the noise of their harsh
voices flat and hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two voices from
among all the rest: they were louder and nearer to him the captains of the two
parties seemed to be bringing up the rear debating as they went
cant you stop your rabble making such a racket shagrat  grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half the noise said the other
but let the lads play no need to worry about shelob for a bit i reckon shes
sat on a nail it seems and we shant cry about that didnt you see: a nasty
mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers
if weve stopped it once weve stopped it a hundred times so let em laugh
and weve struck a bit of luck at last: got something that lugbúrz
wants
lugbúrz wants it eh what is it dyou think elvish it looked
to me but undersized whats the danger in a thing like that 
dont know till weve had a look
oho so they havent told you what to expect they dont tell us all they
know do they not by half but they can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that even with his strangely
sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said they may but
theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some among my lot as like as not but
theres no doubt about it theyre troubled about
something the nazgûl down below are by your account and lugbúrz
is too something nearly slipped
nearly you say  said gorbag
all right said shagrat but well talk of that later: wait till we get to
the under-way theres a place there where we can talk a bit while the lads go
on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear then there was a rumbling
noise and just as he hurried up a bump as far as he could guess the orcs had
turned and gone into the very opening which frodo and he had tried and found
blocked it was still blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way but the orcs had got through
somehow for he could hear their voices on the other side they were still
running along deeper and deeper into the mountain back towards the tower sam
felt desperate they were carrying off his masters body for some foul purpose
and he could not follow he thrust and pushed at the block and he threw himself
against it but it did not yield then not far inside or so he thought he
heard the two captains voices talking again he stood still listening for a
little hoping perhaps to learn something useful perhaps gorbag who seemed to
belong to minas morgul would come out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice the
messages go through quicker than anything could fly as a rule but i dont
enquire how its done safest not to grr those nazgûl give me the
creeps and they skin the body off you as soon as look at you and leave you
all cold in the dark on the other side but he likes em theyre his favourites
nowadays so its no use grumbling i tell you its no game serving down in the
city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagrat
id like to try somewhere where theres none of em but the wars on now
and when thats over things may be easier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag well see but anyway if it does go well
there should be a lot more room what dyou say - if we get a chance you and
mell slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads somewhere
where theres good loot nice and handy and no big bosses
ah  said shagrat like old times
yes said gorbag but dont count on it im not easy in my mind as i
said the big bosses ay his voice sank almost to a whisper ay even the
biggest can make mistakes something nearly slipped you say i say something has
slipped and weve got to look out always the poor uruks to put slips right
and small thanks but dont forget: the enemies dont love us any more than they
love him and if they get topsides on him were done too but see here: when
were you ordered out 
about an hour ago just before you saw us a message came: nazgûl
uneasy spies feared on stairs double vigilance patrol to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business said gorbag see here - our silent watchers were uneasy more
than two days ago that i know but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day
nor any message sent to lugbúrz either: owing to the great signal going
up and the high nazgûl going off to the war and all that and then they
couldnt get lugbúrz to pay attention for a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat big things going on
away west they say
i daresay growled gorbag but in the meantime enemies have got up the
stairs and what were you up to youre supposed to keep watch arent you
special orders or no what are you for
thats enough dont try and teach me my job we were awake all right we
knew there were funny things going on
very funny 
yes very funny: lights and shouting and all but shelob was on the go my
lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak whats that 
you must have seen him: little thin black fellow like a spider himself or
perhaps more like a starved frog hes been here before came out
of lugbúrz the first time years ago and we had word from high up to let
him pass hes been up the stairs once or twice since then but weve
left him alone: seems to have some understanding with her ladyship i suppose
hes no good to eat: she wouldnt worry about words from high up but a fine
guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket early
last night we saw him anyway my lads reported that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemed good enough for me until the message came i thought her
sneak had brought her a toy or that youd perhaps sent her a present a
prisoner of war or something i dont interfere when shes playing nothing gets
by shelob when shes on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyes back there i tell you im not
easy in my mind whatever came up the stairs did get by it cut her web
and got clean out of the hole thats something to think about 
ah well but she got him in the end didnt she 
got him got who this little fellow but if he was the only
one then shed have had him off to her larder long before and there hed be
now and if lugbúrz wanted him youd
have to go and get him nice for you but there was more than one
at this point sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear
against the stone
who cut the cords shed put round him shagrat same one as cut the web
didnt you see that and who stuck a pin into her ladyship same one i reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat 
shagrat made no reply
you may well put your thinking cap on if youve got one its no laughing
matter no one no one has ever stuck a pin in shelob before as you should know
well enough theres no grief in that but think-theres someone loose
hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked
since the bad old times since the great siege something has slipped
and what is it then  growled shagrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say theres a large warrior loose
elf most likely with an elf-sword anyway and an axe as well maybe: and hes
loose in your bounds too and youve never spotted him very funny indeed 
gorbag spat sam smiled grimly at this description of himself
ah well you always did take a gloomy view said shagrat you can read the
signs how you like but there may be other ways to explain them anyhow ive
got watchers at every point and im going to deal with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we have caught then ill begin to
worry about something else
its my guess you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag he
may have had nothing to do with the real mischief the big fellow with the sharp
sword doesnt seem to have thought him worth much anyhow - just left him lying:
regular elvish trick
well see come on now weve talked enough lets go and have a look at the
prisoner
what are you going to do with him dont forget i spotted him first if
theres any game me and my lads must be in it
now now growled shagrat i have my orders and its more than my bellys
worth or yours to break em any trespasser found
by the guard is to be held at the tower prisoner is to be stripped full
description of every article garment weapon letter ring or trinket is to be
sent to lugbúrz at once and to lugbúrz only and
the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact under pain of death for every member
of the guard until he sends or comes himself thats plain enough and thats
what im going to do
stripped eh  said gorbag what teeth nails hair and all 
no none of that hes for lugbúrz i tell you hes wanted
safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag hes nothing but carrion now
what lugbúrz will do with such stuff i cant guess he might as well go
in the pot
you fool snarled shagrat youve been talking very clever but theres a
lot you dont know though most other folk do youll be for the pot or for
shelob if you dont take care carrion is that all you know of her ladyship
when she binds with cords shes after meat she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck
cold blood this fellow isnt dead 
sam reeled clutching at the stone he felt as if the whole dark world was
turning upside down so great was the shock that he almost swooned but even as
he fought to keep a hold on his senses deep inside him he was aware of the
comment: you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it dont trust your
head samwise it is not the best part of you the trouble with you is that you
never really had any hope now what is to be done  fur the moment nothing but
to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen listen to the vile
orc-voices
garn said shagrat shes got more than one poison when shes hunting
she just gives em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned fish and then
she has her way with them dyou remember old ufthak we lost him for days then
we found him in a corner hanging up he was but he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him maybe but we didnt touch him-no good
interfering with her nar - this little filth hell
wake up in a few hours and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit hell be all
right or would be if lugbúrz would let him alone and of course beyond
wondering where he is and whats happened to him
and whats going to happen to him laughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate if we cant do anything else i
dont suppose hes ever been in lovely lugbúrz so he may like to know
what to expect this is going to be more funny than i thought lets go
theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat and hes got to be
kept safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i were you id catch the big one thats loose before you
send in any report to lugbúrz it wont sound too pretty to say youve
caught the kitten and let the cat escape
the voices began to move away sam heard the sound of feet receding he was
recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him i got it all wrong
 he cried i knew i would now theyve got him the devils the filth never
leave your master never never: that was my right rule and i knew it in my
heart may i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him somehow somehow 
he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt but it only gave
out a dull sound the sword however blazed so brightly now that he could see
dimly in its light to his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped
like a heavy door and was less than twice his own height above it was a dark
blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening it was probably
only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of shelob fastened on the inside
with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning with his remaining
strength sam leaped and caught the top scrambled up and dropped and then he
ran madly sword blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond
thought of weariness he could not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catching the two orcs up:
their voices were growing nearer again now they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat in angry tones put him right up
in the top chamber
what for  growled gorbag havent you any lock-ups down below 
hes going out of harms way i tell you answered shagrat see hes
precious i dont trust all my lads and none of yours nor you neither when
youre mad for fun hes going where i want him and where you wont come if
you dont keep civil up to the top i say hell be safe there
will he said sam youre forgetting the great big elvish warrior thats
loose and with that he raced round the last corner only to find that by some
trick of the tunnel or of the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged
the distance
the two orc-figures were still some way ahead he could see them now black
and squat against a red glare the passage ran straight at last up an incline
and at the end wide open were great double doors leading probably to deep
chambers far below the high horn of the tower already the orcs with their
burden had passed inside gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns and banging of gongs a
hideous clamour gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yelled and brandished sting but his little voice was drowned in the
tumult no one heeded him
the great doors slammed to boom the bars of iron fell into place inside
clang the gate was shut sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates
and fell senseless to the ground he was out in the darkness frodo was alive
but taken by the enemy
here ends the second part of the history of the war of the ring
pippin looked out from the shelter of gandalf’s cloak  he wondered if he
was awake or still sleeping  still in the swift-moving dream in which he had
been wrapped so long since the great ride began  the dark world was rushing by
and the wind sang loudly in his ears  he could see nothing but the wheeling
stars  and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of
the south marched past  sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their journey  but his memory was drowsy and uncertain 
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt  and then in
the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold  and they had come to the silent town
and the great empty house on the hill  and hardly had they reached its shelter
when the winged shadow had passed over once again  and men wilted with fear  but
gandalf had spoken soft words to him  and he had slept in a corner  tired but
uneasy  dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving
orders  and then again riding  riding in the night  this was the second  no  the
third night since he had looked in the stone  and with that hideous memory he
woke fully  and shivered  and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing
voices 
a light kindled in the sky  a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers
pippin cowered back  afraid for a moment  wondering into what dreadful country
gandalf was bearing him  he rubbed his eyes  and then he saw that it was the
moon rising above the eastern shadows  now almost at the full  so the night was
not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on  he stirred and spoke 
‘where are we  gandalf ’ he asked 
‘in the realm of gondor ’ the wizard answered  ‘the land of anórien
is still passing by ’
there was a silence again for a while  then  ‘what is that ’ cried pippin
suddenly  clutching at gandalf’s cloak  ‘look  fire  red fire  are there
dragons in this land  look  there is another ’
for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse  ‘on  shadowfax  we must hasten 
time is short  see  the beacons of gondor are alight  calling for aid  war is
kindled  see  there is the fire on amon dîn  and flame on eilenach  and
there they go speeding west  nardol  erelas  min-rimmon  calenhad  and the
halifirien on the borders of rohan ’
but shadowfax paused in his stride  slowing to a walk  and then he lifted up
his head and neighed  and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses came  and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard  and three riders
swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the west 
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away  and the night flowed
over him like a roaring wind 
pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf telling him
of the customs of gondor  and how the lord of the city had beacons built on the
tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range  and maintained
posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his
errand-riders to rohan in the north  or to belfalas in the south  ‘it is long
since the beacons of the north were lit ’ he said  ‘and in the ancient days
of gondor they were not needed  for they had the seven stones ’ pippin stirred
uneasily 
‘sleep again  and do not be afraid ’ said gandalf  ‘for you are not
going like frodo to mordor  but to minas tirith  and there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere in these days  if gondor falls  or the ring is taken 
then the shire will be no refuge ’
‘you do not comfort me ’ said pippin  but nonetheless sleep crept over
him  the last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a
glimpse of high white peaks  glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as
they caught the light of the westering moon  he wondered where frodo was  and if
he was already in mordor  or if he was dead  and he did not know that frodo from
far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of the
day 
pippin woke to the sound of voices  another day of hiding and a night of
journey had fleeted by  it was twilight  the cold dawn was at hand again  and
chill grey mists were about them  shadowfax stood steaming with sweat  but he
held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness  many tall men heavily
cloaked stood beside him  and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone 
partly ruinous it seemed  but already before the night was passed the sound of
hurried labour could be heard  beat of hammers  clink of trowels  and the creak
of wheels  torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog  gandalf
was speaking to the men that barred his way  and as he listened pippin became
aware that he himself was being discussed 
‘yea truly  we know you  mithrandir ’ said the leader of the men  ‘and
you know the pass-words of the seven gates and are free to go forward  but we do
not know your companion  what is he  a dwarf out of the mountains in the north 
we wish for no strangers in the land at this time  unless they be mighty men of
arms in whose faith and help we can trust ’
‘i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor ’ said gandalf  ‘and
as for valour  that cannot be computed by stature  he has passed through more
battles and perils than you have  ingold  though you be twice his height  and he
comes now from the storming of isengard  of which we bear tidings  and great
weariness is on him  or i would wake him  his name is peregrin  a very valiant
man ’
‘man ’ said ingold dubiously  and the others laughed 
‘man ’ cried pippin  now thoroughly roused  ‘man  indeed not  i am a
hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man  save perhaps now and again by
necessity  do not let gandalf deceive you ’
‘many a doer of great deeds might say no more ’ said ingold  ‘but what
is a hobbit ’
‘a halfling ’ answered gandalf  ‘nay  not the one that was spoken
of ’ he added seeing the wonder in the men’s faces  ‘not he  yet one of
his kindred ’
‘yes  and one who journeyed with him ’ said pippin  ‘and boromir of
your city was with us  and he saved me in the snows of the north  and at the
last he was slain defending me from many foes ’
‘peace ’ said gandalf  ‘the news of that grief should have been told
first to the father ’
‘it has been guessed already ’ said ingold  ‘for there have been
strange portents here of late  but pass on now quickly  for the lord of minas
tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son  be he
man or-‘
‘hobbit ’ said pippin  ‘little service can i offer to your lord  but
what i can do  i would do  remembering boromir the brave ’
‘fare you well ’ said ingold  and the men made way for shadow fax  and he
passed through a narrow gate in the wall  ‘may you bring good counsel to
denethor in his need  and to us all  mithrandir ’ ingold cried  ‘but you
come with tidings of grief and danger  as is your wont  they say ’
‘because i come seldom but when my help is needed ’ answered gandalf 
‘and as for counsel  to you i would say that you are over-late in repairing
the wall of the pelennor  courage will now be your best defence against the
storm that is at hand - that and such hope as i bring  for not all the tidings
that i bring are evil  but leave your trowels and sharpen your swords ’
‘the work will be finished ere evening ’ said ingold  ‘this is the last
portion of the wall to be put in defence  the least open to attack  for it looks
towards our friends of rohan  do you know aught of them  will they answer the
summons  think you ’
‘yes  they will come  but they have fought many battles at your back  this
road and no road looks towards safety any longer  be vigilant  but
for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of anórien
and no riders of rohan  and you may yet  fare you well  and sleep not ’
gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the rammas echor  so the men of
gondor called the out wall that they had built with great labour  after ithilien
fell under the shadow of their enemy  for ten leagues or more it ran from the
mountains’ feet and so back again  enclosing in its fence the fields of the
pelennor  fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes and terraces falling to
the deep levels of the anduin  at its furthest point from the great gate of the
city  north-eastward  the wall was four leagues distant  and there from a
frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river  and men had made it
high and strong  for at that point  upon a walled causeway  the road came in
from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and passed through a guarded gate
between embattled towers  at its nearest point the wall was little more than one
league from the city  and that was south-eastward  there anduin  going in a wide
knee about the hills of emyn arnen in south ithilien  bent sharply west  and the
out-wall rose upon its very brink  and beneath it lay the quays and landings of
the harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs 
the townlands were rich  with wide tilth and many orchards  and homesteads
there were with oast and garner  fold and byre  and many rills rippling through
the green from the highlands down to anduin  yet the herdsmen and husbandmen
that dwelt there were not many  and the most part of the people of gondor lived
in the seven circles of the city  or in the high vales of the mountain-borders 
in lossarnach  or further south in fair lebennin with its five swift streams 
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea  they were reckoned
men of gondor  yet their blood was mingled  and there were short and swarthy
folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the
shadow of the hills in the dark years ere the coming of the kings  but beyond 
in the great fief of belfalas  dwelt prince imrahil in his castle of dol amroth
by the sea  and he was of high blood  and his folk also  tall men and proud with
sea-grey eyes 
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky 
and pippin roused himself and looked up  to his left lay a sea of mist  rising
to a bleak shadow in the east  but to his right great mountains reared their
heads  ranging from the west to a steep and sudden end  as if in the making of
the land the river had burst through a great barrier  carving out a mighty
valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come  and there where the
white mountains of ered nimrais came to their end he saw  as gandalf had
promised  the dark mass of mount mindolluin  the deep purple shadows of its high
glens  and its tall face whitening in the rising day  and upon its out-thrust
knee was the guarded city  with its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the
earth 
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white 
blushing faintly in the dawn  and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern
shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the city  then pippin cried
aloud  for the tower of ecthelion  standing high within the topmost walls’
shone out against the sky  glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver  tall and
fair and shapely  and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals 
and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning
breeze’ and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets 
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the
rising of the sun  and its iron doors rolled back before them 
‘mithrandir  mithrandir ’ men cried  ‘now we know that the storm is
indeed nigh ’
‘it is upon you ’ said gandalf  ‘i have ridden on its wings  let me
pass  i must come to your lord denethor  while his stewardship lasts  whatever
betide  you have come to the end of the gondor that you have known  let me
pass ’
then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no
further  though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at
the horse that bore him  for the people of the city used horses very little and
they were seldom seen in their streets  save only those ridden by the
errand-riders of their lord  and they said  ‘surely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of rohan  maybe the rohirrim will come soon to strengthen
us ’ but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road 
for the fashion of minas tirith was such that it was built on seven levels 
each delved into the hill  and about each was set a wall  and in each wall was a
gate  but the gates were not set in a line  the great gate in the city wall was
at the east point of the circuit  but the next faced half south  and the third
half north  and so to and fro upwards  so that the paved way that climbed
towards the citadel turned first this way and then that across the face of the
hill  and each time that it passed the line of the great gate it went through an
arched tunnel  piercing a vast pier of rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided
in two all the circles of the city save the first  for partly in the primeval
shaping of the hill  partly by the mighty craft and labour of old  there stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the gate a towering bastion of stone 
its edge sharp as a ship-keel facing east  up it rose  even to the level of the
topmost circle  and there was crowned by a battlement  so that those in the
citadel might  like mariners in a mountainous ship  look from its peak sheer
down upon the gate seven hundred feet below  the entrance to the citadel also
looked eastward  but was delved in the heart of the rock  thence a long lamp-lit
slope ran up to the seventh gate  thus men reached at last the high court  and
the place of the fountain before the feet of the white tower  tall and shapely 
fifty fathoms from its base to the pinnacle  where the banner of the stewards
floated a thousand feet above the plain 
a strong citadel it was indeed  and not to be taken by a host of enemies  if
there were any within that could hold weapons  unless some foe could come behind
and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin  and so come upon the narrow shoulder
that joined the hill of guard to the mountain mass  but that shoulder  which
rose to the height of the fifth wall  was hedged with great ramparts right up to
the precipice that overhung its western end  and in that space stood the houses
and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords  for ever silent between the mountain
and the tower 
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city  vaster and more
splendid than anything that he had dreamed of  greater and stronger than
isengard  and far more beautiful  yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay  and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there 
in every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and
arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes  names
pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there  and yet now
they were silent  and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements  nor voice was
heard in their halls  nor any face looked out from door or empty window 
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate  and the warm sun that
shone down beyond the river  as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien  glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars  and the great arch with keystone
carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head  gandalf dismounted  for no
horse was allowed in the citadel  and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away
at the soft word of his master 
the guards of the gate were robed in black  and their helms were of strange
shape  high-crowned  with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face  and above
the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds  but the helms gleamed
with a flame of silver  for they were indeed wrought of mithril 
heirlooms from the glory of old days  upon the black surcoats were embroidered
in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many-pointed
stars  this was the livery of the heirs of elendil  and none wore it now in all
gondor  save the guards of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown 
already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them  and at once
they were admitted  silently  and without question  quickly gandalf strode
across the white-paved court  a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun 
and a sward of bright green lay about it  but in the midst  drooping over the
pool  stood a dead tree  and the falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and
broken branches back into the clear water 
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf  it looked mournful  he
thought  and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where
everything else was well tended 
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree 
the words that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind  and then he
found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower  and
behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the house of stone 
they walked down a paved passage  long and empty  and as they went gandalf
spoke softly to pippin  ‘be careful of your words  master peregrin  this is no
time for hobbit pertness  théoden is a kindly old man  denethor is
of another sort  proud and subtle  a man of far greater lineage and power 
though he is not called a king  but he will speak most to you  and question you
much  since you can tell him of his son boromir  he loved him greatly  too much
perhaps  and the more so because they were unlike  but under cover of this love
he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me 
do not tell him more than you need  and leave quiet the matter of frodo’s
errand  i will deal with that in due time  and say nothing about aragorn either 
unless you must ’
‘why not  what is wrong with strider ’ pippin whispered  ‘he meant to
come here  didn’t he  and he’ll be arriving soon himself anyway ’
‘maybe  maybe ’ said gandalf  ‘though if he comes  it is likely to be
in some way that no one expects  not even denethor  it will be better so  at
least he should come unheralded by us ’
gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal  ‘see  master pippin 
there is no time to instruct you now in the history of gondor  though it might
have been better  if you had learned something of it  when you were still
birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire  do as i bid  it is
scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord
to speak over much of the coming of one who will  if he comes  claim the
kingship  is that enough ’
‘kingship ’ said pippin amazed 
‘yes ’ said gandalf  ‘if you have walked all these days with closed
ears and mind asleep  wake up now ’ he knocked on the door 
the door opened  but no one could be seen to open it  pippin looked into a
great hall  it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either side  beyond
the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof  monoliths of black marble  they
rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of beasts and leaves  and
far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold  inset with flowing
traceries of many colours  no hangings nor storied webs  nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood  were to be seen in that long solemn hall  but between the
pillars there stood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone 
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath  and awe fell on
him  as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead  at the far end upon a
dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped like a
crowned helm  behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a
tree in flower  but the throne was empty  at the foot of the dais  upon the
lowest step which was broad and deep  there was a stone chair  black and
unadorned  and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap  in his hand was a white
rod with a golden knob  he did not look up  solemnly they paced the long floor
towards him  until they stood three paces from his footstool  then gandalf
spoke 
‘hail  lord and steward of minas tirith  denethor son of ecthelion  i am
come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour ’
then the old man looked up  pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones
and skin like ivory  and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes  and he
was reminded not so much of boromir as of aragorn  ‘dark indeed is the
hour ’ said the old man  ‘and at such times you are wont to come 
mithrandir  but though all the signs forebode that the doom of gondor is drawing
nigh  less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness  it has been told to
me that you bring with you one who saw my son die  is this he ’
‘it is ’ said gandalf  ‘one of the twain  the other is with théoden
of rohan and may come hereafter  halflings they are  as you see  yet this is not
he of whom the omens spoke ’
‘yet a halfling still ’ said denethor grimly  ‘and little love do i
bear the name  since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew
away my son on the wild errand to his death  my boromir  now we have need of
you  faramir should have gone in his stead ’
‘he would have gone ’ said gandalf  ‘be not unjust in your grief 
boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it  he was a
masterful man  and one to take what he desired  i journeyed far with him and
learned much of his mood  but you speak of his death  you have had news of that
ere we came ’
‘i have received this ’ said denethor  and laying down his rod he lifted
from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at  in each hand he held up one
half of a great horn cloven through the middle  a wild-ox horn bound with
silver 
‘that is the horn that boromir always wore ’ cried pippin 
‘verily ’ said denethor  ‘and in my turn i
bore it  and so did each eldest son of our house  far back into the vanished
years before the failing of the kings  since vorondil father of mardil hunted
the wild kine of araw in the far fields of rhûn  i heard it blowing dim
upon the northern marches thirteen days ago  and the river brought it to
me  broken  it will wind no more ’ he paused and there was a heavy silence 
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin  ‘what say you to that 
halfling ’
‘thirteen  thirteen days ’ faltered pippin  ‘yes  i think that would be
so  yes  i stood beside him  as he blew the horn  but no help came  only more
orcs ’
‘so ’ said denethor  looking keenly at pippin’s face  ‘you were
there  tell me more  why did no help come  and how did you escape  and yet he
did not  so mighty a man as he was  and only orcs to withstand him ’
pippin flushed and forgot his fear  ‘the mightiest man may be slain by one
arrow ’ he said  ‘and boromir was pierced by many  when last i saw him he
sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side  then i
swooned and was made captive  i saw him no more  and know no more  but i honour
his memory  for he was very valiant  he died to save us  my kinsman meriadoc and
myself  waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark lord  and though he
fell and failed  my gratitude is none the less ’
then pippin looked the old man in the eye  for pride stirred strangely within
him  still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice  ‘little
service  no doubt  will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit  a
halfling from the northern shire  yet such as it is  i will offer it  in payment
of my debt ’ twitching aside his grey cloak  pippin drew forth his small sword
and laid it at denethor’s feet 
a pale smile  like a gleam of cold sun on a winter’s evening  passed over
the old man’s face  but he bent his head and held out his hand  laying the
shards of the horn aside  ‘give me the weapon ’ he said 
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him  ‘whence came this ’ said
denethor  ‘many  many years lie on it  surely this is a blade wrought by our
own kindred in the north in the deep past ’
‘it came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ‘ said
pippin  ‘but only evil wights dwell there now  and i will not willingly tell
more of them ’
‘i see that strange tales are woven about you ’ said denethor  ‘and
once again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling  i accept
your service  for you are not daunted by words  and you have courteous speech 
strange though the sound of it may be to us in the south  and we shall have need
of all folk of courtesy  be they great or small  in the days to come  swear to
me now ’
‘take the hilt ’ said gandalf  ‘and speak after the lord  if you are
resolved on this ’
‘i am ’ said pippin 
the old man laid the sword along his lap  and pippin put his hand to the
hilt  and said slowly after denethor 
‘here do i swear fealty and service to gondor  and to the lord and steward
of the realm  to speak and to be silent  to do and to let be  to come and to go 
in need or plenty  in peace or war  in living or dying  from this hour
henceforth  until my lord release me  or death take me  or the world end  so say
i  peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings ’
and this do i hear  denethor son of ecthelion  lord of gondor  steward of the
high king  and i will not forget it  nor fail to reward that which is given 
fealty with love  valour with honour  oath-breaking with vengeance ’ then
pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath 
‘and now ’ said denethor  ‘my first command to you  speak and be not
silent  tell me your full tale  and see that you recall all that you can of
boromir  my son  sit now and begin ’ as he spoke he struck a small silver gong
that stood near his footstool  and at once servants came forward  pippin saw
then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door  unseen
as he and gandalf entered 
‘bring wine and food and seats for the guests ’ said denethor  ‘and see
that none trouble us for one hour ’
‘it is all that i have to spare  for there is much else to heed ’ he said
to gandalf  ‘much of more import  it may seem  and yet to me less pressing 
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day ’
‘and earlier  it is to be hoped ’ said
gandalf  ‘for i have not ridden hither from isengard  one hundred and fifty
leagues  with the speed of wind  only to bring you one small warrior  however
courteous  is it naught to you that théoden has fought a great battle and
that isengard is overthrown  and that i have broken the staff of
saruman ’
‘it is much to me  but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my own
counsel against the menace of the east ’ he turned his dark eyes on gandalf 
and now pippin saw a likeness between the two  and he felt the strain between
them  almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire  drawn from eye to eye 
that might suddenly burst into flame 
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than gandalf did  more
kingly  beautiful  and powerful  and older  yet by a sense other than sight
pippin perceived that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom  and a
majesty that was veiled  and he was older  far older  ‘how much older ’ he
wondered  and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it
before  treebeard had said something about wizards  but even then he had not
thought of gandalf as one of them  what was gandalf  in what far time and place
did he come into the world  and when would he leave it  and then his musings
broke off  and he saw that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the
eye  as if reading the other’s mind  but it was denethor who first withdrew
his gaze 
‘yea ’ he said  ‘for though the stones be lost  they say  still the
lords of gondor have keener sight than lesser men  and many messages come to
them  but sit now ’
then men came bearing a chair and a low stool  and one brought a salver with
a silver flagon and cups  and white cakes  pippin sat down  but he could not
take his eyes from the old lord  was it so  or had he only imagined it  that as
he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon pippin’s
face 
‘now tell me your tale  my liege ’ said denethor  half kindly  half
mockingly  ‘for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome
indeed ’
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the
lord of gondor  stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions  and all the while
conscious of gandalf at his side  watching and listening  and  so pippin felt 
holding in check a rising wrath and impatience  when the hour was over and
denethor again rang the gong  pippin felt worn out  ‘it cannot be more than
nine o’clock ’ he thought  ‘i could now eat three breakfasts on end ’
‘lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for him ’ said
denethor  ‘and his companion may lodge with him for the present  if he will 
but be it known that i have now sworn him to my service  and he shall be known
as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser pass-words  send word to the
captains that they shall wait on me here  as soon as may be after the third hour
has rung 
‘and you  my lord mithrandir  shall come too  as and when you will  none
shall hinder your coming to me at any time  save only in my brief hours of
sleep  let your wrath at an old man’s folly run off and then return to my
comfort ’
‘folly ’ said gandalf  ‘nay  my lord  when you are a dotard you will
die  you can use even your grief as a cloak  do you think that i do not
understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least 
while i sit by ’
‘if you understand it  then be content ’ returned denethor  ‘pride
would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need  but you deal out such
gifts according to your own designs  yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other men’s purposes  however worthy  and to him there is no
purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of gondor  and the
rule of gondor  my lord  is mine and no other man’s  unless the king should
come again ’
‘unless the king should come again ’ said gandalf  ‘well  my lord
steward  it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event  which
few now look to see  in that task you shall have all the aid that you are
pleased to ask for  but i will say this  the rule of no realm is mine  neither
of gondor nor any other  great or small  but all worthy things that are in peril
as the world now stands  those are my care  and for my part  i shall not wholly
fail of my task  though gondor should perish  if anything passes through this
night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come 
for i also am a steward  did you not know ’ and with that he turned and strode
from the hall with pippin running at his side 
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word to him as they went  their
guide brought them from the doors of the hall  and then led them across the
court of the fountain into a lane between tall buildings of stone  after several
turns they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side 
not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain  within  upon
the first floor above the street  up a wide carven stair  he showed them to a
fair room  light and airy  with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured  it
was sparely furnished  having but a small table  two chairs and a bench  but at
either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels
and basins for washing  there were three high narrow windows that looked
northward over the great curve of anduin  still shrouded in mists  towards the
emyn muil and rauros far away  pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over
the deep stone sill 
‘are you angry with me  gandalf ’ he said  as their guide went out and
closed the door  ‘i did the best i could ’
‘you did indeed ’ said gandalf  laughing suddenly  and he came and stood
beside pippin  putting his arm about the hobbit’s shoulders and gazing out of
the window  pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own 
for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry  yet in the wizard’s face
he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow  though as he looked more intently
he perceived that under all there was a great joy  a fountain of mirth enough to
set a kingdom laughing  were it to gush forth 
‘indeed you did your best ’ said the wizard  ‘and i hope that it may be
long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such
terrible old men  still the lord of gondor learned more from you than you may
have guessed  pippin  you could not hide the fact that boromir did not lead the
company from moria  and that there was one among you of high honour who was
coming to minas tirith  and that he had a famous sword  men think much about the
stories of old days in gondor  and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildur’s bane  since boromir went away 
‘he is not as other men of this time  pippin  and whatever be his descent
from father to son  by some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him  as it does in his other son  faramir  and yet did not in boromir whom he
loved best  he has long sight  he can perceive  if he bends his will thither 
much of what is passing in the minds of men  even of those that dwell far off 
it is difficult to deceive him  and dangerous to try 
‘remember that  for you are now sworn to his service  i do not know what
put it into your head  or your heart  to do that  but it was well done  i did
not hinder it  for generous deed should not be checked by cold counsel  it
touched his heart  as well  may i say it  as pleasing his humour  and at least
you are free now to move about as you will in minas tirith - when you are not on
duty  for there is another side to it  you are at his command  and he will not
forget  be wary still ’
he fell silent and sighed  ‘well  no need to brood on what tomorrow may
bring  for one thing  tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today  for
many days to come  and there is nothing more that i can do to help it  the board
is set  and the pieces are moving  one piece that i greatly desire to find is
faramir  now the heir of denethor  i do not think that he is in the city  but i
have had no time to gather news  i must go  pippin  i must go to this lords’
council and learn what i can  but the enemy has the move  and he is about to
open his full game  and pawns are likely to see as much of it as any  peregrin
son of paladin  soldier of gondor  sharpen your blade ’
gandalf went to the door  and there he turned  ‘i am in haste pippin ’ he
said  ‘do me a favour when you go out  even before you rest  if you are not
too weary  go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed  these people are
kindly to beasts  for they are a good and wise folk  but they have less skill
with horses than some ’
with that gandalf went out  and as he did so  there came the note of a clear
sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel  three strokes it rang  like silver
in the air  and ceased  the third hour from the rising of the sun 
after a minute pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about
the street  the sun was now shining warm and bright  and the towers and tall
houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward  high in the blue air mount
mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak  armed men went to and fro in
the ways of the city  as if going at the striking of the hour to changes of post
and duty 
‘nine o’clock we’d call it in the shire ’ said pippin aloud to
himself  ‘just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring
sunshine  and how i should like breakfast  do these people ever have it  or is
it over  and when do they have dinner  and where ’
presently he noticed a man  clad in black and white  coming along the narrow
street from the centre of the citadel towards him  pippin felt lonely and made
up his mind to speak as the man passed  but he had no need  the man came
straight up to him 
‘you are peregrin the halfling ’ he said  ‘i am told that you have been
sworn to the service of the lord and of the city  welcome  he held out his hand
and pippin took it 
‘i am named beregond son of baranor  i have no duty this morning  and i
have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words  and to tell you some of the
many things that no doubt you will wish to know  and for my part  i would learn
of you also  for never before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we
have heard rumour of them  little is said of them in any tale that we know 
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir  do you know him well ’
‘well ’ said pippin  ‘i have known of him all my short life  as
you might say  and lately i have travelled far with him  but there is much to
read in that book  and i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two  yet
perhaps i know him as well as any but a few  aragorn was the only one of our
company  i think  who really knew him ’
‘aragorn ’ said beregond  ‘who is he ’
‘oh ’ stammered pippin  ‘he was a man who went about with us  i think
he is in rohan now ’
‘you have been in rohan  i hear  there is much that i would ask you of that
land also  for we put much of what little hope we have in its people  but i am
forgetting my errand  which was first to answer what you would ask  what would
you know  master peregrin ’
‘er well ’ said pippin  ‘if i may venture to say so  rather a burning
question in my mind at present is  well  what about breakfast and all that  i
mean  what are the meal-times  if you understand me  and where is the
dining-room  if there is one  and the inns  i looked  but never a one could i
see as we rode up  though i had been borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as
soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men ’
beregond looked at him gravely  ‘an old campaigner  i see ’ he said 
‘they say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food
and of drink  though i am not a travelled man myself  then you have not yet
eaten today ’
‘well  yes  to speak in courtesy  yes ’ said pippin  ‘but no more than
a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord  but he
racked me for it with an hour of questions  and that is hungry work ’
beregond laughed  ‘at the table small men may do the greater deeds  we say 
but you have broken your fast as well as any man in the citadel  and with
greater honour  this is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of
war  we rise ere the sun  and take a morsel in the grey light  and go to our
duties at the opening hour  but do not despair ’ he laughed again  seeing the
dismay in pippin’s face  ‘those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to
refresh their strength in the mid-morning  then there is the nuncheon  at noon
or after as duties allow  and men gather for the daymeal  and such mirth as
there still may be  about the hour of sunset 
‘come  we will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment  and eat
and drink on the battlement  and survey the fair morning ’
‘one moment ’ said pippin blushing  ‘greed  or hunger by your courtesy 
put it out of my mind  but gandalf  mithrandir as you call him  asked me to see
to his horse - shadowfax  a great steed of rohan  and the apple of the king’s
eye  i am told  though he has given him to mithrandir for his services  i think
his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men  and if his good
will is of any value to this city  you will treat shadowfax with all honour 
with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit  if it is possible ’
‘hobbit ’ said beregond 
‘that is what we call ourselves ’ said pippin 
‘i am glad to learn it ’ said beregond  ‘for now i may say that strange
accents do not mar fair speech  and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk  but come 
you shall make me acquainted with this good horse  i love beasts  and we see
them seldom in this stony city  for my people came from the mountain-vales  and
before that from ithilien  but fear not  the visit shall be short  a mere call
of courtesy  and we will go thence to the butteries ’
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended  for in the sixth
circle  outside the walls of the citadel  there were some fair stables where a
few swift horses were kept  hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the
lord  messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of denethor or his
chief captains  but now all the horses and the riders were out and away 
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head  ‘good
morning ’ said pippin  ‘gandalf will come as soon as he may  he is busy  but
he sends greetings  and i am to see that all is well with you  and you resting 
i hope  after your long labours ’
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped  but he allowed beregond to handle his
head gently and stroke his great flanks 
‘he looks as if he were spoiling for a race  and not newly come from a
great journey ’ said beregond  ‘how strong and proud he is  where is his
harness  it should be rich and fair ’
‘none is rich and fair enough for him ’ said pippin  ‘he will have
none  if he will consent to bear you  bear you he does  and if not  well  no
bit  bridle  whip  or thong will tame him  farewell  shadowfax  have patience 
battle is coming ’
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed  so that the stable shook  and they
covered their ears  then they took their leave  seeing that the manger was well
filled 
‘and now for our manger ’ said beregond  and he led pippin back to the
citadel  and so to a door in the north side of the great tower  there they went
down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps  there were hatches in
the walls at the side  and one of these was open 
‘this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard ’ said
beregond  ‘greetings  targon ’ he called through the hatch  ‘it is early
yet  but here is a newcomer that the lord has taken into his service  he has
ridden long and far with a tight belt  and has had sore labour this morning  and
he is hungry  give us what you have ’
they got there bread  and butter  and cheese and apples  the last of the
winter store  wrinkled but sound and sweet  and a leather flagon of new-drawn
ale  and wooden platters and cups  they put all into a wicker basket and climbed
back into the sun  and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the
great out-thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill  from there they could look out on the morning over
the world 
they ate and drank  and they talked now of gondor and its ways and customs 
now of the shire and the strange countries that pippin had seen  and ever as
they talked beregond was more amazed  and looked with greater wonder at the
hobbit  swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat  or standing tiptoe upon
it to peer over the sill at the lands below 
‘i will not hide from you  master peregrin ’ said beregond  ‘that to us
you look almost as one of our children  a lad of nine summers or so  and yet you
have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could boast of 
i thought it was the whim of our lord to take him a noble page  after the manner
of the kings of old  they say  but i see that it is not so  and you must pardon
my foolishness ’
‘i do ’ said pippin  ‘though you are not far wrong  i am still little
more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people  and it will be four years yet
before i “come of age”  as we say in the shire  but do not bother about me 
come and look and tell me what i can see ’
the sun was now climbing  and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up 
the last of them were floating away  just overhead  as wisps of white cloud
borne on the stiffening breeze from the east  that was now flapping and tugging
the flags and white standards of the citadel  away down in the valley-bottom 
five leagues or so as the eye leaps  the great river could now be seen grey and
glittering  coming out of the north-west  and bending in a mighty sweep south
and west again  till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer  far beyond which
lay the sea fifty leagues away 
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out before him  dotted into the
distance with farmsteads and little walls  barns and byres  but nowhere could he
see any kine or other beasts  many roads and tracks crossed the green fields 
and there was much coming and going  wains moving in lines towards the great
gate  and others passing out  now and again a horseman would ride up  and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the city  but most of the traffic went out along
the chief highway  and that turned south  and then bending swifter than the
river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight  it was wide and well-paved 
and along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding-track  and beyond that a
wall  on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro  but all the street seemed to be
choked with great covered wains going south  but soon pippin saw that all was in
fact well-ordered  the wains were moving in three lines  one swifter drawn by
horses  another slower  great waggons with fair housings of many colours  drawn
by oxen  and along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by
trudging men 
‘that is the road to the vales of tumladen and lossarnach  and the
mountain-villages  and then on to lebennin ’ said beregond  ‘there go the
last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children  and the women
that must go with them  they must all be gone from the gate and the road clear
for a league before noon  that was the order  it is a sad necessity ’ he
sighed  ‘few  maybe  of those now sundered will meet again  and there were
always too few children in this city  but now there are none-save some young
lads that will not depart  and may find some task to do  my own son is one of
them ’
they fell silent for a while  pippin gazed anxiously eastward  as if at any
moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields  ‘what can i see
there ’ he asked  pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the
anduin  ‘is that another city  or what is it ’
‘it was a city ’ said beregond  ‘the chief city of gondor  of which
this was only a fortress  for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of
anduin  which our enemies took and burned long ago  yet we won it back in the
days of the youth of denethor  not to dwell in  but to hold as an outpost  and
to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms  and then came the fell riders
out of minas morgul ’
‘the black riders ’ said pippin  opening his eyes  and they were wide and
dark with an old fear re-awakened 
‘yes  they were black ’ said beregond  ‘and i see that you know
something of them  though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales ’
‘i know of them ’ said pippin softly  ‘but i will not speak of them
now  so near  so near ’ he broke off and lifted his eyes above the river  and
it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow 
perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight  their jagged edges
softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air  perhaps it was but a
cloud-wall  and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom  but even as he looked it
seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering  very slowly  slowly
rising to smother the regions of the sun 
‘so near to mordor ’ said beregond quietly  ‘yes  there it lies  we
seldom name it  but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow  sometimes it
seems fainter and more distant  sometimes nearer and darker  it is growing and
darkening now  and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too  and the fell
riders  less than a year ago they won back the crossings  and many of our best
men were slain  boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back from this
western shore  and we hold still the near half of osgiliath  for a little while 
but we await now a new onslaught there  maybe the chief onslaught of the war
that comes ’
‘when ’ said pippin  ‘have you a guess  for i saw the beacons last
night and the errand-riders  and gandalf said that it was a sign that war had
begun  he seemed in a desperate hurry  but now everything seems to have slowed
up again ’
‘only because everything is now ready ’ said beregond  ‘it is but the
deep breath before the plunge ’
‘but why were the beacons lit last night ’
‘it is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged ’ answered
beregond  ‘but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains  they
have many ways of gathering news  and the lord denethor is unlike other men  he
sees far  some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the tower at
night  and bends his thought this way and that  he can read somewhat of the
future  and that he will at times search even the mind of the enemy  wrestling
with him  and so it is that he is old  worn before his time  but however that
may be  my lord faramir is abroad  beyond the river on some perilous errand  and
he may have sent tidings 
‘but if you would know what i think set the beacons ablaze  it was the news
that came yestereve out of lebennin  there is a great fleet drawing near to the
mouths of anduin  manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south  they have long
ceased to fear the might of gondor  and they have allied them with the enemy 
and now make a heavy stroke in his cause  for this attack will draw off much of
the help that we looked to have from lebennin and belfalas  where folk are hardy
and numerous  all the more do our thoughts go north to rohan  and the more glad
are we for these tidings of victory that you bring 
‘and yet’ - he paused and stood up  and looked round  north 
east  and south - ‘the doings at isengard should warn us that we are caught
now in a great net and strategy  this is no longer a bickering at the fords 
raiding from ithilien and from anórien  ambushing and pillaging  this is
a great war long-planned  and we are but one piece in it  whatever pride
may say  things move in the far east beyond the inland sea  it is reported  and
north in mirkwood and beyond  and south in harad  and now all realms shall be
put to the test  to stand  or fall - under the shadow 
‘yet  master peregrin  we have this honour  ever we bear the brunt of the
chief hatred of the dark lord  for that hatred comes down out of the depths of
time and over the deeps of the sea  here will the hammer-stroke fall hardest 
and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste  for if we fall  who
shall stand  and  master peregrin  do you see any hope that we shall stand ’
pippin did not answer  he looked at the great walls  and the towers and brave
banners  and the sun in the high sky  and then at the gathering gloom in the
east  and he thought of the long fingers of that shadow  of the orcs in the
woods and the mountains  the treason of isengard  the birds of evil eye  and the
black riders even in the lanes of the shire - and of the winged terror 
the nazgûl  he shuddered  and hope seemed to wither  and even at that
moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured  as though a dark wing had
passed across it  almost beyond hearing he thought he caught  high and far up in
the heavens  a cry  faint  but heart-quelling  cruel and cold  he
blanched and cowered against the wall 
‘what was that ’ asked beregond  ‘you also felt something ’
‘yes ’ muttered pippin  ‘it is the sign of our fall  and the shadow of
doom  a fell rider of the air ’
‘yes  the shadow of doom ’ said beregond  ‘i fear that minas tirith
shall fall  night comes  the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away ’
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak  then
suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the banners
still streaming in the breeze  he shook himself  ‘it is passed ’ he said 
‘no  my heart will not yet despair  gandalf fell and has returned and is with
us  we may stand  if only on one leg  or at least be left still upon our
knees ’
‘rightly said ’ cried beregond  rising and striding to and fro  ‘nay 
though all things must come utterly to an end in time  gondor shall not perish
yet  not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of
carrion before them  there are still other fastnesses  and secret ways of escape
into the mountains  hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where
the grass is green ’
‘all the same  i wish it was over for good or ill ’ said pippin  ‘i am
no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle  but waiting on the edge of
one that i can’t escape is worst of all  what a long day it seems already  i
should be happier  if we were not obliged to stand and watch  making no move 
striking nowhere first  no stroke would have been struck in rohan  i think  but
for gandalf ’
‘ah  there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel ’ said
beregond  ‘but things may change when faramir returns  he is bold  more bold
than many deem  for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be
wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song  as he is  and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field  but such is faramir  less reckless
and eager than boromir  but not less resolute  yet what indeed can he do  we
cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm  our reach is shortened  and
we cannot strike till some foe comes within it  then our hand must be heavy ’
he smote the hilt of his sword 
pippin looked at him  tall and proud and noble  as all the men that he had
yet seen in that land  and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the
battle  ‘alas  my own hand feels as light as a feather ’ he thought  but he
said nothing  ‘a pawn did gandalf say  perhaps but on the wrong chessboard ’
so they talked until the sun reached its height  and suddenly the noon-bells
were rung  and there was a stir in the citadel  for all save the watchmen were
going to their meal 
‘will you come with me ’ said beregond  ‘you may join my mess for this
day  i do not know to what company you will be assigned  or the lord may hold
you at his own command  but you will be welcome  and it will be well to meet as
many men as you may  while there is yet time ’
‘i shall be glad to come ’ said pippin  ‘i am lonely  to tell you the
truth  i left my best friend behind in rohan  and i have had no one to talk to
or jest with  perhaps i could really join your company  are you the captain  if
so  you could take me on  or speak for me ’
‘nay  nay ’ beregond laughed  ‘i am no captain  neither office nor rank
nor lordship have i  being but a plain man of arms of the third company of the
citadel  yet  master peregrin  to be only a man of arms of the guard of the
tower of gondor is held worthy in the city  and such men have honour in the
land ’
‘then it is far beyond me ’ said pippin  ‘take me back to our room  and
if gandalf is not there  i will go where you like - as your guest ’
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message  so pippin went with
beregond and was made known to the men of the third company  and it seemed that
beregond got as much honour from it as his guest  for pippin was very welcome 
there had already been much talk in the citadel about mithrandir’s companion
and his long closeting with the lord  and rumour declared that a prince of the
halflings had come out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five
thousand swords  and some said that when the riders came from rohan each would
bring behind him a halfling warrior  small maybe  but doughty 
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale  he could not be
rid of his new rank  only fitting  men thought  to one befriended by boromir and
honoured by the lord denethor  and they thanked him for coming among them  and
hung on his words and stories of the outlands  and gave him as much food and ale
as he could wish  indeed his only trouble was to be ‘wary’ according to the
counsel of gandalf  and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a
hobbit among friends 
at length beregond rose  ‘farewell for this time ’ he said  ‘i have
duty now till sundown  as have all the others here  i think  but if you are
lonely  as you say  maybe you would like a merry guide about the city  my son
would go with you gladly  a good lad  i may say  if that pleases you  go down to
the lowest circle and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath celerdain  the
lampwrights’ street  you will find him there with other lads that are
remaining in the city  there may be things worth seeing down at the great gate
ere the closing ’
he went out  and soon after all the others followed  the day was still fine 
though it was growing hazy  and it was hot for march  even so far southwards 
pippin felt sleepy  but the lodging seemed cheerless  and he decided to go down
and explore the city  he took a few morsels that he had saved to shadowfax  and
they were graciously accepted  though the horse seemed to have no lack  then he
walked on down many winding ways 
people stared much as he passed  to his face men were gravely courteous 
saluting him after the manner of gondor with bowed head and hands upon the
breast  but behind him he heard many calls  as those out of doors cried to
others within to come and see the prince of the halflings  the companion of
mithrandir  many used some other tongue than the common speech  but it was not
long before he learned at least what was meant by ernil i pheriannath and
knew that his title had gone down before him into the city 
he came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to the
lowest and widest circle  and there he was directed to the lampwrights’
street  a broad way running towards the great gate  in it he found the old
guesthouse  a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running back
from the street  and between them a narrow greensward  behind which was the
many-windowed house  fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch and a
flight of steps down on to the grass  boys were playing among the pillars  the
only children that pippin had seen in minas tirith  and he stopped to look at
them  presently one of them caught sight of him  and with a shout he sprang
across the grass and came into the street  followed by several others  there he
stood in front of pippin  looking him up and down 
‘greetings ’ said the lad  ‘where do you come from  you are a stranger
in the city ’
‘i was ’ said pippin  ‘but they say i have become a man of gondor ’
‘oh come ’ said the lad  ‘then we are all men here  but how old are
you  and what is your name  i am ten years already  and shall soon be five feet 
i am taller than you  but then my father is a guard  one of the tallest  what is
your father ’
‘which question shall i answer first ’ said pippin  ‘my father farms
the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire  i am nearly twenty-nine 
so i pass you there  though i am but four feet  and not likely to grow any more 
save sideways ’
‘twenty-nine ’ said the lad and whistled  ‘why  you are quite old  as
old as my uncle iorlas  still ’ he added hopefully  ‘i wager i could stand
you on your head or lay you on your back ’
‘maybe you could  if i let you ’ said pippin with a laugh  ‘and maybe i
could do the same to you  we know some wrestling tricks in my little country 
where  let me tell you  i am considered uncommonly large and strong  and i have
never allowed anyone to stand me on my head  so if it came to a trial and
nothing else would serve  i might have to kill you  for when you are older  you
will learn that folk are not always what they seem  and though you may have
taken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey  let me warn you  i am not  i am
a halfling  hard  bold  and wicked ’ pippin pulled such a grim face that the
boy stepped back a pace  but at once he returned with clenched fists and the
light of battle in his eye 
‘no ’ pippin laughed  ‘don’t believe what strangers say of themselves
either  i am not a fighter  but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say who he is ’
the boy drew himself up proudly  ‘i am bergil son of beregond of the
guards ’ he said 
‘so i thought ’ said pippin  ‘for you look like your father  i know him
and he sent me to find you ’
‘then why did you not say so at once ’ said bergil  and suddenly a look
of dismay came over his face  ‘do not tell me that he has changed his mind 
and will send me away with the maidens  but no  the last wains have gone ’
‘his message is less bad than that  if not good ’ said pippin  ‘he says
that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head  you might show me round
the city for a while and cheer my loneliness  i can tell you some tales of far
countries in return ’
bergil clapped his hands  and laughed with relief  ‘all is well ’ he
cried  ‘come then  we were soon going to the gate to look on  we will go
now ’
‘what is happening there ’
‘the captains of the outlands are expected up the south road ere sundown 
come with us and you will see ’
bergil proved a good comrade  the best company pippin had had since he parted
from merry  and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the
streets  heedless of the many glances that men gave them  before long they found
themselves in a throng going towards the great gate  there pippin went up much
in the esteem of bergil  for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard
saluted him and let him pass through  and what was more  he allowed him to take
his companion with him 
‘that is good ’ said bergil  ‘we boys are no longer allowed to pass the
gate without an elder  now we shall see better ’
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of
the great paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran  all eyes were
turned southwards  and soon a murmur rose  ‘there is dust away there  they are
coming ’
pippin and bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd  and
waited  horns sounded at some distance  and the noise of cheering rolled towards
them like a gathering wind  then there was a loud trumpet-blast  and all about
them people were shouting 
‘forlong  forlong ’ pippin heard men calling  ‘what do they say ’ he
asked 
‘forlong has come ’ bergil answered  ‘old forlong the fat  the lord of
lossarnach  that is where my grandsire lives  hurrah  here he is  good old
forlong ’
leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse  and on it sat a
man of wide shoulders and huge girth  but old and grey-bearded  yet mail-clad
and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear  behind him marched proudly a
dusty line of men  well-armed and bearing great battle-axes  grim-faced they
were  and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen
in gondor 
‘forlong ’ men shouted  ‘true heart  true friend  forlong ’ but when
the men of lossarnach had passed they muttered  ‘so few  two hundreds  what
are they  we hoped for ten times the number  that will be the new tidings of the
black fleet  they are sparing only a tithe of their strength  still every little
is a gain ’
and so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the
gate  men of the outlands marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark hour 
but always too few  always less than hope looked
for or need asked  the men of ringló vale behind the son of their lord 
dervorin striding on foot  three hundreds  from the uplands of morthond  the
great blackroot vale  tall duinhir with his sons  duilin and derufin  and
five hundred bowmen  from the anfalas  the langstrand far away  a long line of
men of many sorts  hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages  scantily
equipped save for the household of golasgil their lord  from lamedon  a few grim
hillmen without a captain  fisher-folk of the ethir  some hundred or more spared
from the ships  hirluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath gelin with
three hundreds of gallant green-clad men  and last and proudest  imrahil  prince
of dol amroth  kinsman of the lord  with gilded banners bearing his token of the
ship and the silver swan  and a company of knights in full harness riding grey
horses  and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms  tall as lords  grey-eyed 
dark-haired  singing as they came 
and that was all  less than three thousands full told  no more would come 
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the city and died away  the
onlookers stood silent for a while  dust hung in the air  for the wind had died
and the evening was heavy  already the closing hour was drawing nigh  and the
red sun had gone behind mindolluin  shadow came down on the city 
pippin looked up  and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey  as
if a vast dust and smoke hung above them  and light came dully through it  but
in the west the dying sun had set all the fume on fire  and now mindolluin stood
black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers  ‘so ends a fair day in
wrath ’ he said forgetful of the lad at his side 
‘so it will  if i have not returned before the sundown-bells ’ said
bergil  ‘come  there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate ’
hand in hand they went back into the city  the last to pass the gate before
it was shut  and as they reached the lampwrights’ street all the bells in the
towers tolled solemnly  lights sprang in many windows  and from the houses and
wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of song 
‘farewell for this time ’ said bergil  ‘take my greetings to my
 father  and thank him for the company that he sent  come again soon  i beg 
almost i wish now that there was no war  for we might have had some merry times 
we might have journeyed to lossarnach  to my grandsire’s house  it is good to
be there in spring  the woods and fields are full of flowers  but maybe we will
go thither together yet  they will never overcome our lord  and my father is
very valiant  farewell and return ’
they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel  it seemed a long
way  and he grew hot and very hungry  and night closed down swift and dark  not
a star pricked the sky  he was late for the daymeal in the mess  and beregond
greeted him gladly  and sat him at his side to hear news of his son  after the
meal pippin stayed a while  and then took his leave  for a strange gloom was on
him  and now he desired very much to see gandalf again 
‘can you find your way ’ said beregond at the door of the small hall  on
the north side of the citadel  where they had sat  ‘it is a black night  and
all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the city 
and none are to shine out from the walls  and i can give you news of another
order  you will be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow  i fear you will
not be for the third company  still we may hope to meet again  farewell and
sleep in peace ’
the lodging was dark  save for a little lantern set on the table  gandalf was
not there  gloom settled still more heavily on pippin  he climbed on the bench
and tried to peer out of a window  but it was like looking into a pool of ink 
he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed  for a while he lay and
listened for sounds of gandalf’s return  and then he fell into an uneasy
sleep 
in the night he was wakened by a light  and he saw that gandalf had come and
was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove  there were
candles on the table and rolls of parchment  he heard the wizard sigh  and
mutter  ‘when will faramir return ’
‘hullo ’ said pippin  poking his head round the curtain  ‘i thought you
had forgotten all about me  i am glad to see you back  it has been a long
day ’
‘but the night will be too short ’ said gandalf  ‘i have come back
here  for i must have a little peace  alone  you should sleep  in a bed while
you still may  at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again  no 
when the summons comes  not at sunrise  the darkness has begun  there will be no
dawn ’
 
gandalf was gone  and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night 
when merry came back to aragorn  he had only a light bundle  for he had lost his
pack at parth galen  and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up
among the wreckage of isengard  hasufel was already saddled  legolas and gimli
with their horse stood close by 
‘so four of the company still remain ’ said aragorn  ‘we will ride on
together  but we shall not go alone  as i thought  the king is now determined to
set out at once  since the coming of the winged shadow  he desires to return to
the hills under cover of night ’
‘and then whither ’ said legolas 
‘i cannot say yet ’ aragorn answered  ‘as for the king  he will go to
the muster that he commanded at edoras  four nights from now  and there  i
think  he will hear tidings of war  and the riders of rohan will go down to
minas tirith  but for myself  and any that will go with me      ’
‘i for one ’ cried legolas  ‘and gimli with him ’ said the dwarf 
‘well  for myself ’ said aragorn  ‘it is dark before me  i must go down
also to minas tirith  but i do not yet see the road  an hour long prepared
approaches ’
‘don’t leave me behind ’ said merry  ‘i have not been of much use
yet  but i don’t want to be laid aside  like baggage to be called for when all
is over  i don’t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now 
though  of course  the king did say that i was to sit by him when he came to his
house and tell him all about the shire ’
‘yes ’ said aragorn  ‘and your road lies with him  i think  merry  but
do not look for mirth at the ending  it will be long 
i fear  ere théoden sits at ease again in meduseld  many hopes will
wither in this bitter spring ’
soon all were ready to depart  twenty-four horses  with gimli behind legolas 
and merry in front of aragorn  presently they were riding swiftly through the
night  they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen  when a rider
galloped up from the rear of their line 
‘my lord ’ he said to the king  ‘there are horsemen behind us  as we
crossed the fords i thought that i heard them  now we are sure  they are
overtaking us  riding hard ’
théoden at once called a halt  the riders turned about and seized
their spears  aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground  and drawing his
sword he stood by the king’s stirrup  éomer and his esquire rode back
to the rear  merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever  and he
wondered  if there was a fight  what he should do  supposing the king’s small
escort was trapped and overcome  but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the
wild fields of rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles 
‘no good ’ he thought  he drew his sword and tightened his belt 
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud  but suddenly it rode
out clear again  then they all heard the sound of hoofs  and at the same moment
they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords  the moonlight
glinted here and there on the points of spears  the number of the pursuers could
not be told  but they seemed no fewer than the king’s escort  at the least 
when they were some fifty paces off  éomer
cried in a loud voice  ‘halt  halt  who rides in rohan ’
the pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand  a silence followed  and
then in the moonlight  a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slowly
forward  his hand showed white as he held it up  palm outward  in token of
peace  but the king’s men gripped their weapons  at ten paces the man stopped 
he was tall  a dark standing shadow  then his clear voice rang out 
‘rohan  rohan did you say  that is a glad word  we seek that land in haste
from long afar ’
‘you have found it ’ said éomer  ‘when you crossed the fords
yonder you entered it  but it is the realm of théoden the king  none ride
here save by his leave  who are you  and what is your haste ’
‘halbarad dúnadan  ranger of the north
i am ’ cried the man  ‘we seek one aragorn son of arathorn  and we heard
that he was in rohan ’
‘and you have found him also ’ cried aragorn  giving his reins to merry 
he ran forward and embraced the newcomer  ‘halbarad ’ he said  ‘of all
joys this is the least expected ’
merry breathed a sigh of relief  he had thought that this was some last trick
of saruman’s  to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him  but it
seemed that there would be no need to die in théoden’s defence 
not yet at any rate  he sheathed his sword 
‘all is well ’ said aragorn  turning back  ‘here are some of my own kin
from the far land where i dwelt  but why they come  and how many they be 
halbarad shall tell us ’
‘i have thirty with me ’ said halbarad  ‘that is all of our kindred
that could be gathered in haste  but the brethren elladan and elrohir have
ridden with us  desiring to go to the war  we rode as swiftly as we might when
your summons came ’
‘but i did not summon you ’ said aragorn  ‘save only in wish  my
thoughts have often turned to you  and seldom more than tonight  yet i have sent
no word  but come  all such matters must wait  you find us riding in haste and
danger  ride with us now  if the king will give his leave ’
théoden was indeed glad of the news  ‘it is well ’ he said 
‘if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself  my lord aragorn  thirty such
knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads ’
then the riders set out again  and aragorn for a while rode with the dúnedain 
and when they had spoken of tidings in the north and in the south  elrohir said
to him 
‘i bring word to you from my father  the days are short  if thou art in
haste  remember the paths of the dead ’
‘always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire ’
answered aragorn  ‘but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road ’
‘that will soon be seen ’ said elrohir  ‘but let us speak no more of
these things upon the open road ’
and aragorn said to halbarad  ‘what is that that you bear  kinsman ’ for
he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff  as it were a standard  but
it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs 
‘it is a gift that i bring you from the lady of rivendell ’ answered
halbarad  ‘she wrought it in secret  and long was the making  but she also
sends word to you  the days now are short  either our hope cometh  or all
hopes end  therefore i send thee what i have made for thee  fare well  elfstone ’
and aragorn said  ‘now i know what you bear  bear it still for me a
while ’ and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars  and
then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night’s journey lasted 
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from
deeping-coomb and came back to the hornburg  there they were to lie and rest for
a brief while and take counsel 
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli  ‘the sun is high ’
said legolas  ‘all others are up and doing  come  master sluggard  and look at
this place while you may ’
‘there was a battle here three nights ago ’ said gimli  ‘and here
legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc  come and see how it
was  and there are caves  merry  caves of wonder  shall we visit them  legolas 
do you think ’
‘nay  there is no time ’ said the elf  ‘do not spoil the wonder with
haste  i have given you my word to return hither with you  if a day of peace and
freedom comes again  but it is now near to noon  and at that hour we eat  and
then set out again  i hear ’
merry got up and yawned  his few hours’ sleep had not been nearly enough 
he was tired and rather dismal  he missed pippin  and felt that he was only a
burden  while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not
fully understand  ‘where is aragorn ’ he asked 
‘in a high chamber of the burg ’ said legolas  ‘he has neither rested
nor slept  i think  he went thither some hours ago  saying that he must take
thought  and only his kinsman  halbarad  went with him  but some dark doubt or
care sits on him ’
‘they are a strange company  these newcomers ’ said gimli  ‘stout men
and lordly they are  and the riders of rohan look almost as boys beside them 
for they are grim men of face  worn like weathered rocks for the most part  even
as aragorn himself  and they are silent ’
‘but even as aragorn they are courteous  if they break their silence ’
said legolas  ‘and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir  less
sombre is their gear than the others’  and they are fair and gallant as
elven-lords  and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of elrond of
rivendell ’
‘why have they come  have you heard ’ asked merry  he had now dressed 
and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders  and the three passed out
together towards the ruined gate of the burg 
‘they answered a summons  as you heard ’ said gimli  ‘word came to
rivendell  they say  aragorn has need of his
kindred  let the dúnedain ride to him in rohan  but whence
this message came they are now in doubt  gandalf sent it  i would guess ’
‘nay  galadriel ’ said legolas  ‘did she not speak through gandalf of
the ride of the grey company from the north ’
‘yes  you have it ’ said gimli  ‘the lady of the wood  she read many
hearts and desires  now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk 
legolas ’
legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and east 
and his fair face was troubled  ‘i do not think that any would come ’ he
answered  ‘they have no need to ride to war  war already marches on their own
lands ’
for a while the three companions walked together  speaking of this and that
turn of the battle  and they went down from the broken gate  and passed the
mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road  until they stood on
helm’s dike and looked into the coomb  the death down already stood there 
black and tall and stony  and the great trampling and scoring of the grass by
the huorns could be plainly seen  the dunlendings and many men of the garrison
of the burg were at work on the dike or in the fields and about the battered
walls behind  yet all seemed strangely quiet  a weary valley resting after a
great storm  soon they turned back and went to the midday meal in the hall of
the burg 
the king was already there  and as soon as they entered he called for merry
and had a seat set for him at his side  ‘it is not as i would have it ’ said
théoden  ‘for this is little like my fair house in edoras  and your
friend is gone  who should also be here  but it may be long ere we sit  you and
i  at the high table in meduseld  there will be no time for feasting when
i return thither  but come now  eat and drink  and let us speak together while
we may  and then you shall ride with me ’
‘may i ’ said merry  surprised and delighted  ‘that would be
splendid ’ he had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words  ‘i am
afraid i am only in everybody’s way ’ he stammered  ‘but i should like to
do anything i could  you know ’
‘i doubt it not ’ said the king  ‘i have had a good hill-pony made
ready for you  he will bear you as swift as any
horse by the roads that we shall take  for i will ride from the burg by mountain
paths  not by the plain  and so come to edoras by way of dunharrow where the
lady éowyn awaits me  you shall be my esquire  if you will  is there gear
of war in this place  éomer  that my sword-thain could use ’
‘there are no great weapon-hoards here  lord ’ answered éomer 
‘maybe a light helm might be found to fit him  but we have no mail or sword
for one of his stature ’
‘i have a sword ’ said merry  climbing from
his seat  and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade  filled
suddenly with love for this old man  he knelt on one knee  and took his hand and
kissed it  ‘may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire on your lap théoden
king ’ he cried  ‘receive my service  if you will ’
‘gladly will i take it ’ said the king  and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hobbit  he blessed him  ‘rise now  meriadoc 
esquire of rohan of the household of meduseld ’ he said  ‘take your sword
and bear it unto good fortune ’
‘as a father you shall be to me ’ said merry 
‘for a little while ’ said théoden 
they talked then together as they ate  until presently éomer spoke 
‘it is near the hour that we set for our going  lord ’ he said  ‘shall i
bid men sound the horns  but where is aragorn  his place is empty and he
has not eaten ’
‘we will make ready to ride ’ said théoden  ‘but let word be
sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh ’
the king with his guard and merry at his side passed down from the gate of
the burg to where the riders were assembling on the green  many were already
mounted  it would be a great company  for the king was leaving only a small
garrison in the burg  and all who could be spared were riding to the weapontake
at edoras  a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night  but still
there would be some five hundred more to go with the king  for the most part men
from the fields and dales of westfold 
a little apart the rangers sat  silent  in an ordered company  armed with
spear and bow and sword  they were clad in cloaks of dark grey  and their hoods
were cast now over helm and head  their horses were strong and of proud bearing 
but rough-haired  and one stood there without a rider  aragorn’s own horse
that they had brought from the north  roheryn was his name  there was no gleam
of stone or gold  nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness  nor did
their riders bear any badge or token  save only that each cloak was pinned upon
the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star 
the king mounted his horse  snowmane  and merry sat beside him on his pony 
stybba was his name  presently éomer came out from the gate  and with him
was aragorn  and halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black  and two
tall men  neither young nor old so much alike were they  the sons of elrond 
that few could tell them apart  dark-haired  grey-eyed  and their faces
elven-fair  clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey  behind them
walked legolas and gimli  but merry had eyes only for aragorn  so startling was
the change that he saw in him  as if in one night many years had fallen on his
head  grim was his face  grey-hued and weary 
‘i am troubled in mind  lord ’ he said  standing by the king’s horse 
‘i have heard strange words  and i see new perils
far off  i have laboured long in thought  and now i fear that i must change my
purpose  tell me  théoden  you ride now to dunharrow  how long will it be
ere you come there ’
‘it is now a full hour past noon ’ said
éomer  ‘before the night of the third day from now we should come to
the hold  the moon will then be one night past his full  and the muster that the
king commanded will be held the day after  more speed we cannot make  if the
strength of rohan is to be gathered ’
aragorn was silent for a moment  ‘three days ’ he murmured  ‘and the
muster of rohan will only be begun  but i see that it cannot now be hastened ’
he looked up  and it seemed that he had made some decision  his face was less
troubled  then  by our leave  lord  i must take new counsel for myself and my
kindred  we must ride our own road  and no longer in secret  for me the time of
stealth has passed  i will ride east by the swiftest way  and i will take the
paths of the dead ’
‘the paths of the dead ’ said théoden 
and trembled  ‘why do you speak of them ’ éomer turned and gazed at
aragorn  and it seemed to merry that the faces of the riders that sat within
hearing turned pale at the words  ‘if there be in truth such paths ’ said théoden 
‘their gate is in dunharrow  but no living man may pass it ’
‘alas  aragorn my friend ’ said éomer  ‘i had hoped that we
should ride to war together  but if you seek the paths of the dead  then our
parting is come  and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again
under the sun ’
‘that road i will take  nonetheless ’ said aragorn  ‘but i say to you 
éomer  that in battle we may yet meet again  though all the hosts of
mordor should stand between ’
‘you will do as you will  my lord aragorn ’ said théoden  ‘it is
your doom  maybe  to tread strange paths that others dare not  this parting
grieves me  and my strength is lessened by it  but now i must take the
mountain-roads and delay no longer  farewell ’
‘farewell  lord ’ said aragorn  ‘ride unto great renown  farewell 
merry  i leave you in good hands  better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs
to fangorn  legolas and gimli will still hunt with me  i hope  but we shall not
forget you ’
‘good-bye ’ said merry  he could find no more to say  he felt very small 
and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words  more than ever he
missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin  the riders were ready  and their
horses were fidgeting  he wished they would start arid get it over 
now théoden spoke to éomer  and he lifted up his hand
and cried aloud  and with that word the riders set forth  they rode over the
dike and down the coomb  and then  turning swiftly eastwards  they took a path
that skirted the foothills for a mile or so  until bending south it passed back
among the hills and disappeared from view  aragorn rode to the dike and watched
till the king’s men were far down the coomb  then he turned to halbarad 
‘there go three that i love  and the smallest not the least ’ he said 
‘he knows not to what end he rides  yet if he knew  he still would go on ’
‘a little people  but of great worth are the shire-folk ’ said halbarad 
‘little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders 
and yet i grudge it not ’
‘and now our fates are woven together ’ said aragorn  ‘and yet  alas 
here we must part  well  i must eat a little  and then we also must hasten away 
come  legolas and gimli  i must speak with you as i eat ’
together they went back into the burg  yet for some time aragorn sat silent
at the table in the hall  and the others waited for him to speak  ‘come ’
said legolas at last  ‘speak and be comforted  and shake off the shadow  what
has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey morning ’
‘a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the
hornburg ’ answered aragorn  ‘i have looked in the stone of orthanc  my
friends ’
‘you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry ’ exclaimed gimli
with fear and astonishment in his face  ‘did you say aught to - him  even
gandalf feared that encounter ’
‘you forget to whom you speak ’ said aragorn sternly  and his eyes
glinted  ‘did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors of edoras  what
do you fear that i should say to him  nay  gimli ’ he said in a softer voice 
and the grimness left his face  and he looked like one who has laboured in
sleepless pain for many nights  ‘nay  my friends  i and the lawful master of
the stone  and i had both the right and the strength to use it  or so i judged 
the right cannot be doubted  the strength was enough - barely ’
he drew a deep breath  ‘it was a bitter struggle  and the weariness is slow
to pass  i spoke no word to him  and in the end i wrenched the stone to my own
will  that alone he will find hard to endure  and he beheld me  yes  master
gimli  he saw me  but in other guise than you see me here  if that will aid him 
then i have done ill  but i do not think so  to know that i lived and walked the
earth was a blow to his heart  i deem  for he knew it not till now  the eyes in
orthanc did not see through the armour of théoden 
but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil  now in the very
hour of his great designs the heir of isildur and the sword are revealed  for l
showed the blade re-forged to him  he is not so mighty yet that he is
above fear  nay  doubt ever gnaws him ’
‘but he wields great dominion  nonetheless ’ said gimli  ‘and now he
will strike more swiftly ’
‘the hasty stroke goes oft astray ’ said aragorn  ‘we must press our
enemy  and no longer wait upon him for the move  see my friends  when i had
mastered the stone  i learned many things  a grave peril i saw coming
unlooked-for upon gondor from the south that will draw off great strength from
the defence of minas tirith  if it is not countered swiftly  i deem that the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone ’
‘then lost it must be ’ said gimli  ‘for what help is there to send
thither  and how could it come there in time ’
‘i have no help to send  therefore i must go myself ’ said aragorn 
‘but there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the
coastlands before all is lost  that is the paths of the dead ’
‘the paths of the dead ’ said gimli  ‘it is a fell name  and little to
the liking to the men of rohan  as i saw  can the living use such a road and not
perish  and even if you pass that way  what will so few avail to counter the
strokes of mordor ’
‘the living have never used that road since the coming of the rohirrim ’
said aragorn  ‘for it is closed to them  but in this dark hour the heir of
isildur may use it  if he dare  listen  this is the word that the sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in rivendell  wisest in lore  bid aragorn
remember the words of the seer  and the paths of the dead ’
‘and what may be the words of the seer ’ said legolas 
“thus spoke malbeth the seer  in the days of arvedui  last king at
fornost ’ said aragorn 
over the land there lies a long shadow 

westward reaching wings of darkness 

the tower trembles  to the tombs of kings

doom approaches  the dead awaken 

for the hour is come for the oathbreakers 

at the stone of erech they shall stand again

and hear there a horn in the hills ringing 

whose shall the horn be  who shall call them

from the prey twilight  the forgotten people 

the heir of him to whom the oath they swore 

from the north shall he come  need shall drive him 

he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead 
‘dark ways doubtless  said gimli  but no darker than these staves are to
me ’
‘if you would understand them better  then i bid you come with me ’ said
aragorn  ‘for that way i now shall take  but i do not go gladly  only need
drives me  therefore  only of your free will would i have you come  for you will
find both toil and great fear  and maybe worse ’
‘i will go with you even on the paths of the dead  and to whatever  end
they may lead ’ said gimli 
‘i also will come ’ said legolas  ‘for i do not fear the dead ’
‘i hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight ’
said gimli  ‘for otherwise i see not why we should trouble them ’
‘that we shall know if ever we come to erech ’ said aragorn  ‘but the
oath that they broke was to fight against sauron  and they must fight therefore 
if they are to fulfil it  for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was
brought  it was said  from númenor by
isildur  and it was set upon a hill  and upon it the king of the mountains swore
allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of gondor  but when sauron
returned and grew in might again  isildur summoned the men of the mountains
to fulfil their oath  and they would not  for they had worshipped sauron in the
dark years 
‘then isildur said to their king  “thou shalt be the last king  and if
the west prove mightier than thy black master  this curse i lay upon thee and
thy folk  to rest never until your oath is fulfilled  for this war will last
through years uncounted  and you shall be summoned once again ere the end ”
and they fled before the wrath of isildur  and did not dare to go forth to war
on sauron’s part  and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains
and had no dealings with other men  but slowly dwindled in the barren hills  and
the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the hill of erech and all places
where that people lingered  but that way i must go  since there are none living
to help me ’
he stood up  ‘come ’ he cried  and drew his sword  and it flashed in the
twilit hall of the burg  ‘to the stone of erech  i seek the paths of the dead 
come with me who will ’
legolas and gimli made no answer  but they rose and followed aragorn from the
hall  on the green there waited  still and silent  the hooded rangers  legolas
and gimli mounted  aragorn sprang upon roheryn  then halbarad lifted a great
horn  and the blast of it echoed in helm’s deep  and with that they leapt
away  riding down the coomb like thunder  while all the men that were left on
dike or burg stared in amaze 
and while théoden went by slow paths in the hills  the grey company
passed swiftly over the plain  and on the next day in the afternoon they came
to edoras  and there they halted only briefly  ere they passed up the valley 
and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell 
the lady éowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming  for no
mightier men had she seen than the dúnedain and the fair sons of elrond 
but on aragorn most of all her eyes rested  and when they sat at supper with
her  they talked together  and she heard of all that had passed since théoden
rode away  concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her  and when she
heard of the battle in helm’s deep and the great slaughter of their foes  and
of the charge of théoden and his knights  then her eyes shone 
but at last she said  ‘lords  you are weary and shall now go to your beds
with such ease as can be contrived in haste  but tomorrow fairer housing shall
be found for you ’
but aragorn said  ‘nay  lady  be not troubled for us  if we may lie here
tonight and break our fast tomorrow  it will be enough  for i ride on an errand
most urgent  and with the first light of morning we must go ’
she smiled on him and said  ‘then it was kindly done  lord  to ride so many
miles out of your way to bring tidings to éowyn  and to speak with her in
her exile ’
‘indeed no man would count such a journey wasted ’ said aragorn  ‘and
yet  lady  i could not have come hither  if it were not that the road which i
must take leads me to dunharrow ’
and she answered as one that likes not what is said  “then  lord  you are
astray  for out of harrowdale no road runs east or south  and you had best
return as you came ’
‘nay  lady ’ said he  ‘i am not astray  for i walked in this land ere
you were born to grace it  there is a road out of this valley  and that road i
shall take  tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead ’
then she stared at him as one that is stricken  and her face blanched  and
for long she spoke no more  while all sat silent  ‘but  aragorn ’ she said
at last  ‘is it then your errand to seek death  for that is all that you will
find on that road  they do not suffer the living to pass ’
‘they may suffer me to pass ’ said aragorn  ‘but at the least i will
adventure it  no other road will serve ’
‘but this is madness ’ she said  ‘for here are men of renown and
prowess  whom you should not take into the shadows  but should lead to war 
where men are needed  i beg you to remain and ride with my brother  for then all
our hearts will be gladdened  and our hope be the brighter ’
‘it is not madness  lady ’ he answered  ‘for i go on a path appointed 
but those who follow me do so of their free will  and if they wish now to remain
and ride with the rohirrim  they may do so  but i shall take the paths of the
dead  alone  if needs be ’
then they said no more  and they ate in silence  but her eyes were ever upon
aragorn  and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind  at length
they arose  and took their leave of the lady  and thanked her for her care  and
went to their rest 
but as aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and
gimli  and his companions had gone in  there came the lady éowyn
after him and called to him  he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night 
for she was clad in white  but her eyes were on fire 
‘aragorn ’ she said  ‘why will you go on this deadly road ’
‘because i must ’ he said  ‘only so can i see any hope of doing
my part in the war against sauron  i do not choose paths of peril  éowyn 
were i to go where my heart dwells  far in the north i would now be wandering in
the fair valley of rivendell ’
for a while she was silent  as if pondering what this might mean  then
suddenly she laid her hand on his arm  ‘you are a stern lord and resolute ’
she said  ‘and thus do men win renown ’ she paused  ‘lord ’ she said 
‘if you must go  then let me ride in your following  for i am weary of
skulking in the hills  and wish to face peril and battle ’
‘your duty is with your people ’ he answered 
‘too often have i heard of duty ’ she cried  ‘but am i not of the house
of eorl  a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse  i have waited on faltering feet
long enough  since they falter no longer  it seems  may i not now spend my life
as i will ’
‘few may do that with honour ’ he answered  ‘but as for you  lady  did
you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord’s return  if
you had not been chosen  then some marshal or captain would have been set in the
same place  and he could not ride away from his charge  were he weary of it or
no ’
‘shall i always be chosen ’ she said bitterly  ‘shall i always be left
behind when the riders depart  to mind the house while they win renown  and find
food and beds when they return ’
‘a time may come soon ’ said he  ‘when none will return  then there
will be need of valour without renown  for none shall remember the deeds that
are done in the last defence of your homes  yet the deeds will not be less
valiant because they are unpraised ’
and she answered  ‘all your words are but to say  you are a woman  and your
part is in the house  but when the men have died in battle and honour  you have
leave to be burned in the house  for the men will need it no more  but i am of
the house of eorl and not a serving-woman  i can ride and wield blade  and i do
not fear either pain or death ’
‘what do you fear  lady ’ he asked 
‘a cage ’ she said  ‘to stay behind bars  until use and old age accept
them  and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire ’
‘and yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that i had chosen 
because it is perilous ’
‘so may one counsel another ’ she said  ‘yet i do not bid you flee from
peril  but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory  i
would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly ’
‘nor would i ’ he said  ‘therefore i say to you  lady  stay  for you
have no errand to the south ’
‘neither have those others who go with thee  they go only because they
would not be parted from thee - because they love thee ’ then she turned and
vanished into the night 
when the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risen
above the high ridges in the east  aragorn made
ready to depart  his company was all mounted  and he was about to leap into the
saddle  when the lady éowyn came to bid them farewell  she was clad as a
rider and girt with a sword  in her hand she bore a cup  and she set it to her
lips and drank a little  wishing them good speed  and then she gave the
cup to aragorn  and he drank  and he said  ‘farewell  lady of rohan  i drink
to the fortunes of your house  and of you  and of all your people  say to your
brother  beyond the shadows we may meet again ’
then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were nearby that she wept  and in one
so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous  but she said  ‘aragorn  wilt
thou go ’
‘i will ’ he said 
‘then wilt thou not let me ride with this company  as i have asked ’
‘i will not  lady ’ he said  ‘for that i could not grant without leave
of the king and of your brother  and they will not return until tomorrow  but i
count now every hour  indeed every minute  farewell ’
then she fell on her knees  saying  ‘i beg thee ’
‘nay  lady ’ he said  and taking her by the hand he raised her  then he
kissed her hand  and sprang into the saddle  and rode away  and did not look
back  and only those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain that he
bore 
but éowyn stood still as a figure carven in stone  her hands
clenched at her sides  and she watched them until they passed into the shadows
under the black dwimorberg  the haunted mountain  in which was the gate of the
dead  when they were lost to view  she turned  stumbling as one that is blind 
and went back to her lodging  but none of her folk saw this parting  for they
hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until the day was up  and the
reckless strangers were gone 
and some said  ‘they are elvish wights  let them go where they belong  into
the dark places  and never return  the times are evil enough ’
the light was still grey as they rode  for the sun had not yet climbed over
the black ridges of the haunted mountain before them  a dread fell on them  even
as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimholt 
there under the gloom of black trees that not even legolas could long endure
they found a hollow place opening at the mountain’s root  and right in their
path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom 
‘my blood runs chill ’ said gimli  but the others were silent  and his
voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet  the horses would not pass
the threatening stone  until the riders dismounted and led them about  and so
they came at last deep into the glen  and there stood a sheer wall of rock  and
in the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night  signs and
figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read  and fear flowed from it
like a grey vapour 
the company halted  and there was not a heart among them that did not quail 
unless it were the heart of legolas of the elves  for whom the ghosts of men
have no terror 
‘this is an evil door ’ said halbarad  ‘and my death lies beyond it  i
will dare to pass it nonetheless  but no horse will enter ’
‘but we must go in  and therefore the horses must go too ’ said aragorn 
‘for if ever we come through this darkness  many leagues lie beyond  and every
hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer  follow me ’
then aragorn led the way  and such was the strength of his will in that hour
that all the dúnedain and their horses followed him  and indeed the love
that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were
willing to face even the terror of the door  if their masters’ hearts
were steady as they walked beside them  but arod  the horse of rohan  refused
the way  and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see 
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went soft in
the gloom  until he suffered himself to be led  and legolas passed in  and there
stood gimli the dwarf left all alone 
his knees shook  and he was wroth with himself  ‘here is a thing unheard
of ’ he said  ‘an elf will go underground and a
dwarf dare not ’ with that he plunged in  but it seemed to him that he dragged
his feet like lead over the threshold  and at once a blindness came upon him 
even upon gimli glóin’s son who had walked unafraid in many deep places
of the world 
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow  and now he went ahead bearing one
aloft  and elladan with another went at the rear  and gimli  stumbling behind 
strove to overtake him  he could see nothing but the dim flame of the torches 
but if the company halted  there seemed an endless whisper of voices all about
him  a murmur of words in no tongue that he had ever heard before 
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage  and yet steadily
fear grew on the dwarf as he went on  most of all because he knew now that there
could be no turning back  all the paths behind were thronged by an unseen host
that followed in the dark 
so time unreckoned passed  until gimli saw a sight that he was ever
afterwards loth to recall  the road was wide  as far as he could judge  but now
the company came suddenly into a great empty space  and there were no longer any
walls upon either side  the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk 
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorn’s torch drew
near  then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be 
‘does he feel no fear ’ muttered the dwarf  ‘in any other cave gimli glóin’s
son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold  but not here  let it
lie ’
nonetheless he drew near  and saw aragorn kneeling  while elladan held aloft
both torches  before him were the bones of a mighty man  he had been clad in
mail  and still his harness lay there whole  for the cavern’s air was as dry
as dust  and his hauberk was gilded  his belt was of gold and garnets  and rich
with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor  he had
fallen near the far wall of the cave  as now could be seen  and before him stood
a stony door closed fast  his finger-bones were still clawing at the cracks  a
notched and broken sword lay by him  as if he had hewn at the rock in his last
despair 
aragorn did not touch him  but after gazing silently for a while he rose and
sighed  ‘hither shall the flowers of simbelmynë
come never unto world’s end ’ he murmured  ‘nine mounds and seven there
are now green with grass  and through all the long years he has lain at the door
that he could not unlock  whither does it lead  why would he pass  none shall
ever know 
‘for that is not my errand ’ he cried  turning back and speaking to the
whispering darkness behind  ‘keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the
accursed years  speed only we ask  let us pass  and then come  i summon you to
the stone of erech ’
there was no answer  unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than the
whispers before  and then a chill blast came in which the torches flickered and
went out  and could not be rekindled  of the time that followed  one hour or
many  gimli remembered little  the others pressed on  but he was ever hindmost 
pursued by a groping horror that seemed always just about to seize him  and a
rumour came after him like the shadow-sound of many feet  he stumbled on until
he was crawling like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endure no
more  he must either find an ending and escape or run back in madness to meet
the following fear 
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water  a sound hard and clear as a stone
falling into a dream of dark shadow  light grew  and lo  the company passed
through another gateway  high-arched and broad  and a rill ran out beside them 
and beyond  going steeply down  was a road between sheer cliffs  knife-edged
against the sky far above  so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky was
dark  and in it small stars glinted  yet as gimli after learned it was still two
hours ere sunset of the day on which they had set out from dunharrow  though for
all that he could then tell it might have been twilight in some later year  or
in some other world 
the company now mounted again  and gimli returned to legolas  they rode in
file  and evening came on and a deep blue dusk  and still fear pursued them 
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the dwarf saw before his face
the glitter in the elf’s bright eyes  behind them rode elladan  last of the
company  but not the last of those that took the downward road 
‘the dead are following ’ said legolas  ‘i see shapes of men and of
horses  and pale banners like shreds of cloud  and spears like winter-thickets
on a misty night  the dead are following ’
‘yes  the dead ride behind  they have been summoned ’ said elladan 
the company came at last out of the ravine  as suddenly as it they had issued
from a crack in a wall  and there lay the uplands of a great vale before them 
and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over many falls 
‘where in middle-earth are we ’ said gimli  and elladan answered  ‘we
have descended from the uprising of the morthond  the long chill river that
flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of dol amroth  you will not need
to ask hereafter how comes its name  blackroot men call it ’
the morthond vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern
faces of the mountains  its steep slopes were grass-grown  but all was grey in
that hour  for the sun had gone  and far below lights twinkled in the homes of
men  the vale was rich and many folk dwelt there 
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear  ‘friends 
forget your weariness  ride now  ride  we must come to the stone of erech ere
this day passes  and long still is the way ’ so without looking back they rode
the mountain-fields  until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent and
found a road that went down into the land 
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came  and doors were shut  and
folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer  ever there
rose the same cry in the gathering night  ‘the king of the dead  the king of
the dead is come upon us ’
bells were ringing far below  and all men fled before the face of aragorn 
but the grey company in their haste rode like hunters  until their horses were
stumbling with weariness  and thus  just ere midnight  and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the mountains  they came at last to the hill of erech 
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty fields
about it  for upon the top stood a black stone  round as a great globe  the
height of a man  though its half was buried in the ground  unearthly it looked 
as though it had fallen from the sky  as some
believed  but those who remembered still the lore of westernesse told that it
had been brought out of the ruin of númenor and there set by isildur at
his landing  none of the people of the valley dared to approach it  nor
would they dwell near  for they said that it was a trysting-place of the
shadow-men  and there they would gather in times of fear  thronging round the
stone and whispering 
to that stone the company came and halted in the dead of night  then elrohir
gave to aragorn a silver horn  and he blew upon it and it seemed to those that
stood near that they heard a sound of answering horns  as if it was an echo in
deep caves far away  no other sound they heard  and yet they were aware of a
great host gathered all about the hill on which they stood  and a chill wind
like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains  but aragorn dismounted 
and standing by the stone he cried in a great voice 
‘oathbreakers  why have ye come ’
and a voice was heard out of the night that answered him  as if from far
away 
‘to fulfil our oath and have peace ’
then aragorn said  ‘the hour is come at last  now i go to pelargir upon
anduin  and ye shall come after me  and when all this land is clean of the
servants of sauron  i will hold the oath fulfilled  and ye shall have peace and
depart for ever  for i am elessar  isildur’s heir of gondor ’
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had
brought  and behold  it was black  and if there was any device upon it  it was
hidden in the darkness  then there was silence  and not a whisper nor a sigh was
heard again all the long night  the company camped beside the stone  but they
slept little  because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round 
but when the dawn came  cold and pale  aragorn rose at once  and he led the
company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among
them had known  save he alone  and only his will held them to go on  no other
mortal men could have endured it  none but the dúnedain
of the north  and with them gimli the dwarf and legolas of the elves 
they passed tarlang’s neck and came into lamedon  and the shadow host
pressed behind and fear went on before them  until they came to calembel upon
ciril  and the sun went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west
behind them  the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted  for many
men had gone away to war  and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead  but the next day there came no dawn  and
the grey company passed on into the darkness of the storm of mordor and were
lost to mortal sight  but the dead followed them 
 
now all roads were running together to the east to meet the coming of war and
the onset of the shadow  and even as pippin stood at the great gate of the city
and saw the prince of dol amroth ride in with his banners  the king of rohan
came down out of the hills 
day was waning  in the last rays of the sun the riders cast long pointed
shadows that went on before them  darkness had already crept beneath the
murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides  the king rode now
slowly at the end of the day  presently the path turned round a huge bare
shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft-sighing trees  down  down
they went in a long winding file  when at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places  the sun was gone 
twilight lay upon the waterfalls 
all day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass
behind  cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad walls  and now through a stony
gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale  the riders followed it  and
suddenly harrowdale lay before them  loud with the noise of waters in the
evening  there the white snowbourn  joined by the lesser stream  went rushing 
fuming on the stones  down to edoras and the green hills and the plains  away to
the right at the head of the great dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its
vast buttresses swathed in cloud  but its jagged peak  clothed in everlasting
snow  gleamed far above the world  blue-shadowed upon the east  red-stained by
the sunset in the west 
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country  of which he had heard
many tales upon their long road  it was a skyless world  in which his eye 
through dim gulfs of shadowy air  saw only ever-mounting slopes  great walls of
stone behind great walls  and frowning precipices wreathed with mist  he sat for
a moment half dreaming  listening to the noise of water  the whisper of dark
trees  the crack of stone  and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all
sound  he loved mountains  or he had loved the thought of them marching on the
edge of stories brought from far away  but now he was borne down by the
insupportable weight of middle-earth  he longed to shut out the immensity in a
quiet room by a fire 
he was very tired  for though they had ridden slowly  they had ridden with
very little rest  hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had jogged up
and down  over passes  and through long dales  and across many streams 
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king’s side  not
noticing that many of the riders smiled to see the
two together  the hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony  and the lord of rohan
on his great white horse  then he had talked to théoden  telling him
about his home and the doings of the shire-folk  or listening in turn to tales
of the mark and its mighty men of old  but most of the time  especially
on this last day  merry had ridden by himself just behind the king  saying
nothing  and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of rohan that he
heard the men behind him using  it was a language in which there seemed to be
many words that he knew  though spoken more richly and strongly than in the
shire  yet he could not piece the words together  at times some rider would lift
up his clear voice in stirring song  and merry felt his heart leap  though he
did not know what it was about 
all the same he had been lonely  and never more so than now at the day’s
end  he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to  and what
would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli  then suddenly like a cold touch
on his heart he thought of frodo and sam  ‘i am forgetting them ’ he said to
himself reproachfully  ‘and yet they are more important than all the rest of
us  and i came to help them  but now they must be hundreds of miles away  if
they are still alive ’ he shivered 
‘harrowdale at last ’ said éomer  ‘our journey is almost at an
end ’ they halted  the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply  only a
glimpse  as through a tall window  could be seen of the great valley in the
gloaming below  a single small light could be seen twinkling by the
river 
‘this journey is over  maybe ’ said théoden  ‘but i have far yet
to go  last night the moon was full  and in the morning i shall ride to edoras
to the gathering of the mark ’
‘but if you would take my counsel ’ said
éomer in a low voice  ‘you would then return hither  until the war is
over  lost or won ’
théoden smiled  ‘nay  my son  for so i will call you  speak not the
soft words of wormtongue in my old ears ’ he drew himself up and looked back
at the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind  ‘long years in
the space of days it seems since i rode west  but never will i lean on a staff
again  if the war is lost  what good will be my hiding in the hills  and if it
is won  what grief will it be  even if i fall  spending my last strength  but we
will leave this now  tonight i will lie in the hold of dunharrow  one evening of
peace at least is left us  let us ride on ’
in the deepening dusk they came down into the valley  here the snowbourn
flowed near to the western walls of the dale  and soon the path led them to a
ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones  the ford was
guarded  as the king approached many men sprang up out of the shadow of the
rocks  and when they saw the king they cried with
glad voices  ‘théoden king  théoden king  the king of the mark
returns ’
then one blew a long call on a horn  it echoed in the valley  other horns
answered it  and lights shone out across the river 
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above  sounding
from some hollow place  as it seemed  that gathered their notes into one voice
and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone 
so the king of the mark came back victorious out of the west to dunharrow
beneath the feet of the white mountains  there he
found the remaining strength of his people already assembled  for as soon as his
coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford  bearing messages from
gandalf  dúnhere  chieftain of the folk of harrowdale  was at
their head 
‘at dawn three days ago  lord ’ he said  ‘shadowfax came like a wind
out of the west to edoras  and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to
gladden our hearts  but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathering of
the riders  and then came the winged shadow ’
‘the winged shadow ’ said théoden  ‘we saw it also  but that was
in the dead of night before gandalf left us ’
‘maybe  lord ’ said dúnhere  ‘yet the same  or another like to
it  a flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird  passed over
edoras that morning  and all men were shaken with fear  for it stooped upon
meduseld  and as it came low  almost to the gable  there came a cry that stopped
our hearts  then it was that gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the
fields  but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains  and he bade us
to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked  so it has been done 
gandalf spoke with great authority  we trust that it is as you would wish 
naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things ’
‘it is well ’ said théoden  ‘i will ride now to the hold  and
there before i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains  let them come
to me as soon as may be ’
the road now led eastward straight across the valley  which was at that point
little more than half a mile in width  flats and meads of rough grass  grey now
in the falling night  lay all about  but in front on the far side of the dale
merry saw a frowning wall  a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn 
cloven by the river in ages past 
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of men  some thronged to
the roadside  hailing the king and the riders from the west with glad cries  but
stretching away into the distance behind there were ordered rows of tents and
booths  and lines of picketed horses  and great store of arms  and piled spears
bristling like thickets of new-planted trees  now all the great assembly was
falling into shadow  and yet  though the night-chill blew cold from the heights
no lanterns glowed  no fires were lit  watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and
fro 
merry wondered how many riders there were  he could not guess their number in
the gathering gloom  but it looked to him like a great army  many thousands
strong  while he was peering from side to side the king’s party came up under
the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley  and there suddenly the path
began to climb  and merry looked up in amazement  he was on a road the like of
which he had never seen before  a great work of men’s hands in years beyond
the reach of song  upwards it wound  coiling like a snake  boring its way across
the sheer slope of rock  steep as a stair  it looped backwards and forwards as
it climbed  up it horses could walk  and wains could be slowly hauled  but no
enemy could come that way  except out of the air  if it was defended from above 
at each turn of the road there were great standing stones that had been carved
in the likeness of men  huge and clumsy-limbed  squatting cross-legged with
their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies  some in
the wearing of the years had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes
that still stared sadly at the passers-by  the riders hardly glanced at them 
the púkel-men they called them  and heeded them little  no power
or terror was left in them  but merry gazed at them with wonder and a feeling
almost of pity  as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk 
after a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some
hundreds of feet above the valley  but still far below he could dimly see a
winding line of riders crossing the ford and filing along the road towards the
camp prepared for them  only the king and his guard were going up into the hold 
at last the king’s company came to a sharp brink  and the climbing road
passed into a cutting between walls of rock  and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland  the firienfeld men called it  a green mountain-field of
grass and heath  high above the deep-delved courses of the snowbourn  laid upon
the lap of the great mountains behind  the starkhorn southwards  and northwards
the saw-toothed mass of irensaga  between which there faced the riders  the grim
black wall of the dwimorberg  the haunted mountain rising out of steep slopes of
sombre pines  dividing the upland into two there marched a double line of
unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees 
those who dared to follow that road came soon to the black dimholt under
dwimorberg  and the menace of the pillar of stone  and the yawning shadow of the
forbidden door 
such was the dark dunharrow  the work of long-forgotten men  their name was
lost and no song or legend remembered it  for what purpose they had made this
place  as a town or secret temple or a tomb of kings  none
could say  here they laboured in the dark years  before ever a ship came to the
western shores  or gondor of the dúnedain was built  and now they had
vanished  and only the old púkel-men were left  still sitting at the
turnings of the road 
merry stared at the lines of marching stones  they were worn and black  some
were leaning  some were fallen  some cracked or broken  they looked like rows of
old and hungry teeth  he wondered what they could be  and he hoped that the king
was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond  then he saw that there
were clusters of tents and booths on either side of the stony way  but these
were not set near the trees  and seemed rather to huddle away from them towards
the brink of the cliff  the greater number were on the right  where the
firienfeld was wider  and on the left there was a smaller camp  in the midst of
which stood a tall pavilion  from this side a rider now came out to meet them 
and they turned from the road 
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was a woman with long braided hair
gleaming in the twilight  yet she wore a helm and was clad to the waist like a
warrior and girded with a sword 
‘hail  lord of the mark ’ she cried  ‘my heart is glad at your
returning ’
‘and you  éowyn ’ said théoden  ‘is all well with
you ’
‘all is well ’ she answered  yet it seemed to merry that her voice belied
her  and he would have thought that she had been weeping  if that could be
believed of one so stern of face  ‘all is well  it was a weary road for the
people to take  torn suddenly from their homes  there were hard words  for it is
long since war has driven us from the green fields  but there have been no evil
deeds  all is now ordered  as you see  and your lodging is prepared for you  for
i have had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming ’
‘so aragorn has come then ’ said éomer  ‘is he still here ’
‘no  he is gone ’ said éowyn turning away and looking at the
mountains dark against the east and south 
‘whither did he go ’ asked éomer 
‘i do not know ’ she answered  ‘he came at night  and rode away
yestermorn  ere the sun had climbed over the mountain-tops  he is gone ’
‘you are grieved  daughter ’ said théoden  ‘what has happened 
tell me  did he speak of that road ’ he pointed away along the darkening
lines of stones towards the dwimorberg  ‘of the paths of the dead ’
‘yes  lord ’ said éowyn  ‘and he has passed into the shadows
from which none have returned  i could not dissuade him  he is gone ’
‘then our paths are sundered ’ said éomer  ‘he is lost  we
must ride without him  and our hope dwindles ’
slowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass  speaking no
more  until they came to the king’s pavilion  there merry found that
everything was made ready  and that he himself was not forgotten  a little tent
had been pitched for him beside the king’s lodging  and there he sat alone 
while men passed to and fro  going in to the king and taking counsel with him 
night came on  and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned
with stars  but the east was dark and blank  the marching stones faded slowly
from sight  but still beyond them  blacker than the gloom  brooded the vast
crouching shadow of the dwimorberg 
‘the paths of the dead ’ he muttered to himself  ‘the paths of the
dead  what does all this mean  they have all left me now  they have all gone to
some doom  gandalf and pippin to war in the east  and sam and frodo to mordor 
and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead  but my turn will
come soon enough  i suppose  i wonder what they are all talking about  and what
the king means to do  for i must go where he goes now ’
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very
hungry  and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the
same  but at that very moment a trumpet sounded  and a man came summoning him 
the king’s esquire  to wait at the king’s board 
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small space  curtained off with
broidered hangings  and strewn with skins  and
there at a small table sat théoden with éomer and éowyn 
and dúnhere  lord of harrowdale  merry stood beside the king’s stool
and waited on him till presently the old man  coming out of deep thought  turned
to him and smiled 
‘come  master meriadoc ’ he said  ‘you shall not stand  you shall sit
beside me  as long as i remain in my own lands  and lighten my heart with
tales ’
room was made for the hobbit at the king’s left hand  but no one called for
any tale  there was indeed little speech  and they ate and drank for the most
part in silence  until at last  plucking up courage  merry asked the question
that was tormenting him 
‘twice now  lord  i have heard of the paths of the dead ’ he said 
‘what are they  and where has strider  i mean the lord aragorn where has he
gone ’
the king sighed  but no one answered  until at last éomer spoke  ‘we
do not know  and our hearts are heavy ’ he said  ‘but as for the paths of
the dead  you have yourself walked on their first steps  nay  i speak no words
of ill omen  the road that we have climbed is the approach to the door 
yonder in the dimholt  but what lies beyond no man knows ’
‘no man knows ’ said théoden  ‘yet ancient legend  now seldom
spoken  has somewhat to report  if these old tales speak true that have come
down from father to son in the house of eorl  then the door under dwimorberg
leads to a secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end  but
none have ever ventured in to search its secrets  since baldor  son of brego 
passed the door and was never seen among men again  a rash vow he spoke  as he
drained the horn at that feast which brego made to hallow new-built meduseld 
and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir 
‘folk say that dead men out of the dark years guard the way and will suffer
no living man to come to their hidden halls  but at whiles they may themselves
be seen passing out of the door like shadows and down the stony road  then the
people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and shroud their windows and are
afraid  but the dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and
coming death ’
‘yet it is said in harrowdale ’ said éowyn in a low voice  ‘that
in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed
by  whence they came none knew  but they went up the stony road and
vanished into the hill  as if they went to keep a tryst ’
‘then why has aragorn gone that way ’ asked merry  ‘don’t you know
anything that would explain it ’
‘unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that
we have not heard ’ said éomer  ‘none now in the land of the living
can tell his purpose ’
‘greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw him first in the king’s
house ’ said éowyn  ‘grimmer  older  fey i thought him  and like one
whom the dead call ’
‘maybe he was called ’ said théoden 
‘and my heart tells me that i shall not see him again  yet he is a kingly man
of high destiny  and take comfort in this  daughter  since comfort you seem to
need in your grief for this guest  it is said that when the eorlingas
came out of the north and passed at length up the snowbourn  seeking strong
places of refuge in time of need  brego and his son baldor climbed the stair of
the hold and so came before the door  on the threshold sat an old man  aged
beyond guess of years  tall and kingly he had been  but now he was withered as
an old stone  indeed for stone they took him  for he moved not  and he said no
word  until they sought to pass him by and enter  and then a voice came out of
him  as it were out of the ground  and to their amaze it spoke in the western
tongue  the way is shut 
‘then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still  but he did
not look at them  the way is shut  his voice said again it was made by
those who are dead  and the dead keep it  until the time comes  the way is shut 
‘and when will that time be  said baldor  but no answer did he ever
get  for the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face  and no other
tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned  yet
maybe at last the time foretold has come  and aragorn may pass ’
‘but how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no  save by
daring the door ’ said éomer  ‘and that way i would not go though all
the hosts of mordor stood before me  and i were alone and had no other
refuge  alas that a fey mood should fall on a man so greathearted in this hour
of need  are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the
earth  war is at hand ’
he paused  for at that moment there was a noise
outside  a man’s voice crying the name of théoden  and the challenge of
the guard 
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain  ‘a man is
here  lord ’ he said  ‘an errand-rider of gondor  he wishes to come before
you at once ’
‘let him come ’ said théoden 
a tall man entered  and merry choked back a cry  for a moment it seemed to
him that boromir was alive again and had returned  then he saw that it was not
so  the man was a stranger  though as like to boromir as if he were one of his
kin  tall and grey-eyed and proud  he was clad as a rider with a cloak of dark
green over a coat of fine mail  on the front of his helm was wrought a small
silver star  in his hand he bore a single arrow  black-feathered and barbed with
steel  but the point was painted red 
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to théoden  ‘hail lord
of the rohirrim  friend of gondor ’ he said  ‘hirgon i am  errand-rider of
denethor  who bring you this token of war  gondor is in great need  often the
rohirrim have aided us  but now the lord denethor asks for all your
strength and all your speed  lest gondor fall at last ’
‘the red arrow ’ said théoden  holding it  as one who receives a
summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes  his hand trembled  ‘the
red arrow has not been seen in the mark in all my years  has it indeed
come to that  and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my strength and
all my speed may be ’
‘that is best known to yourself  lord ’ said hirgon  ‘but ere long it
may well come to pass that minas tirith is surrounded  and unless you have the
strength to break a siege of many powers  the lord denethor bids me say that he
judges that the strong arms of the rohirrim would be better within his walls
than without ’
‘but he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon horseback and in
the open  and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for the
gathering of our riders  is it not true  hirgon  that the lord of minas tirith
knows more than he sets in his message  for we are already at war  as you may
have seen  and you do not find us all unprepared  gandalf the grey has been
among us  and even now we are mustering for battle in the east ’
‘what the lord denethor may know or guess of all these things i cannot
say ’ answered hirgon  ‘but indeed our case is desperate  my lord does not
issue any command to you  he begs you only to remember old friendship and oaths
long spoken  and for your own good to do all that you may  it is reported to us
that many kings have ridden in from the east to the service of mordor  from the
north to the field of dagorlad there is skirmish and rumour of war  in the south
the haradrim are moving  and fear has fallen on all our coastlands  so that
little help will come to us thence  make haste  for it is before the walls of
minas tirith that the doom of our time will be decided  and if the tide be not
stemmed there  then it will flow over all the fair fields of rohan  and even in
this hold among the hills there shall be no refuge ’
‘dark tidings ’ said théoden  ‘yet not all unguessed  but
say to denethor that even if rohan itself felt no peril  still we would come to
his aid  but we have suffered much loss in our battles with saruman the traitor 
and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east  as his own
tidings make clear  so great a power as the dark lord seems now to wield might
well contain us in battle before the city and yet strike with great force across
the river away beyond the gate of kings 
‘but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence  we will come  the
weapontake was set for the morrow  when all is ordered we will set out  ten
thousand spears i might have sent riding over the plain to the dismay of your
foes  it will be less now  i fear  for i will not leave my strongholds all
unguarded  yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me  for say to
denethor that in this hour the king of the mark himself will come down to the
land of gondor  though maybe he will not ride back  but it is a long road  and
man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight  a week it may be from
tomorrow’s morn ere you hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the
north 
‘a week ’ said hirgon  ‘if it must be so  it must  but you are like to
find only ruined walls in seven days from now  unless other help unlooked-for
comes  still  you may at the least disturb the orcs and swarthy men from their
feasting in the white tower ’
‘at the least we will do that ’ said théoden  ‘but i myself am
new-come from battle and long journey  and i will now go to rest  tarry
here this night  then you shall look on the muster of rohan and ride away the
gladder for the sight  and the swifter for the rest  in the morning counsels are
best  and night changes many thoughts 
with that the king stood up  and they all rose  ‘go now each to your
rest ’ he said  ‘and sleep well  and you  master meriadoc  i need no more
tonight  but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen ’
‘i will be ready ’ said merry  ‘even if you bid me ride with you on the
paths of the dead ’
‘speak not words of omen ’ said the king  ‘for there may be more roads
than one that could bear that name  but i did not say that i would bid you ride
with me on any road  good night ’
‘i won’t be left behind  to be called for on return ’ said merry  ‘i
won’t be left  i won’t ’ and repeating this over and over again to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent 
he was wakened by a man shaking him  ‘wake up  wake up  master holbytla ’
he cried  and at length merry came out of deep dreams and sat up with a start 
it still seemed very dark  he thought 
‘what is the matter ’ he asked 
‘the king calls for you ’
‘but the sun has not risen  yet ’ said merry 
‘no  and will not rise today  master holbytla  nor ever again  one would
think under this cloud  but time does not stand still  though the sun be lost 
make haste ’
flinging on some clothes  merry looked outside  the world was darkling  the
very air seemed brown  and all things about were black and grey and shadowless 
there was a great stillness  no shape of cloud could be seen  unless it were far
away westward  where the furthest groping fingers of the great gloom still
crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them  overhead there hung a
heavy roof  sombre and featureless  and light seemed rather to be failing than
growing 
merry saw many folk standing  looking up and muttering  all their faces were
grey and sad  and some were afraid  with a sinking heart he made his way to the
king  hirgon the rider of gondor was there before him  and beside him stood now
another man  like him and dressed alike  but shorter and broader  as merry
entered he was speaking to the king 
‘it comes from mordor  lord ’ he said  ‘it began last night at sunset 
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i saw it rise and creep across the
sky  and all night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars  now the great
cloud hangs over all the land between here and the mountains of shadow  and it
is deepening  war has already begun ’
for a while the king sat silent  at last he spoke  ‘so we come to it in the
end ’ he said  ‘the great battle of our time  in which many things shall
pass away  but at least there is no longer need for hiding  we will ride the
straight way and the open road and with all our speed  the muster shall begin at
once  and wait for none that tarry  have you good store in minas tirith  for if
we must ride now in all haste  then we must ride light  with but meal and water
enough to last us into battle ’
‘we have very great store long prepared ’ answered hirgon  ride now as
light and as swift as you may ’
‘then call the heralds  éomer ’ said théoden  ‘let the
riders be marshalled ’
éomer went out  and presently the trumpets rang in the hold and were
answered by many others from below  but their voices no longer sounded clear
and brave as they had seemed to merry the night before  dull they seemed and
harsh in the heavy air  braying ominously 
the king turned to merry  ‘i am going to war  master meriadoc ’ he said 
‘in a little while i shall take the road  i release you from
my service  but not from my friendship  you shall abide here  and if you will 
you shall serve the lady éowyn  who will govern the folk in my stead ’
‘but  but  lord ’ merry stammered  ‘i offered you my sword  i do not
want to be parted from you like this  théoden
king  and as all my friends have gone to the battle’ i should be ashamed to
stay behind ’
‘but we ride on horses tall and swift ’ said théoden  ‘and great
though your heart be  you cannot ride on such beasts ’
‘then tie me on to the back of one  or let me hang on a stirrup  or
something ’ said merry  ‘it is a long way to run  but run i shall  if i
cannot ride  even if i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late ’
théoden smiled  ‘rather than that i would bear you with me on
snowmane ’ he said  ‘but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld  for that way i shall go  so far stybba can bear
you  the great race will not begin till we reach the plains ’
then éowyn rose up  ‘come now  meriadoc ’ she said  ‘i will show
you the gear that i have prepared fur you ’ they went out together  ‘this
request only did aragorn make to me ’ said éowyn  as they passed among
the tents  ‘that you should be armed for battle  i have granted it  as i
could  for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end ’
now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of the king’s guard and there
an armourer brought out to her a small helm  and a round shield  and other gear 
‘no mail have we to fit you ’ said éowyn  ‘nor any time for the
forging of such a hauberk  but here is also a stout jerkin of leather  a
belt  and a knife  a sword you have ’
merry bowed  and the lady showed him the shield  which was like the shield
that had been given to gimli  and it bore on it the device of the white horse 
‘take all these things ’ she said  ‘and bear them to good fortune 
farewell now  master meriadoc  yet maybe we shall meet again  you and i ’
so it was that amid a gathering gloom the king of the mark made ready to lead
all his riders on the eastward road  hearts were heavy and many quailed in the
shadow  but they were a stern people  loyal to their lord  and little weeping or
murmuring was heard  even in the camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras
were housed  women and children and old men  doom hung over them  but they faced
it silently 
two swift hours passed  and now the king sat upon his white horse  glimmering
in the half light  proud and tall he seemed  though the hair that flowed beneath
his high helm was like snow  and many marvelled at him and took heart to see him
unbent and unafraid 
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many
companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of riders fully armed  and many
hundreds of other men with spare horses lightly burdened  a single
trumpet sounded  the king raised his hand  and then silently the host of the
mark began to move  foremost went twelve of the king’s household-men  riders
of renown  then the king followed with éomer on his right  he had said
farewell to éowyn above in the hold  and the memory was grievous 
but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead  behind him merry rode on
stybba with the errand riders of gondor  and behind them again twelve more of
the king’s household  they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with
stern and unmoved faces  but when they had come almost to the end of the line
one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit  a young man  merry thought as he
returned the glance  less in height and girth than most  he caught the glint of
clear grey eyes  and then he shivered  for it came suddenly to him that it was
the face of one without hope who goes in search of death 
on down the grey road they went beside the snowbourn rushing on its stones 
through the hamlets of underharrow and upbourn  where many sad faces of women
looked out from dark doors  and so without horn or harp or music of men’s
voices the great ride into the east began with which the songs of rohan were
busy for many long lives of men thereafter 
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning

with thane and captain rode thengel’s son 

to edoras he came  the ancient halls

of the mark-wardens mist-enshrouded 

golden timbers were in gloom mantled 

farewell he bade to his free people 

hearth and high-seat  and the hallowed places 

where long he had feasted ere the light faded 

forth rode the king  fear behind him 

fate before him  fealty kept he 

oaths he had taken  all fulfilled them 

forth rode théoden  five nights and days

east and onward rode the eorlingas

through folde and fenmarch and the firienwood 

six thousand spears to sunlending 

mundburg the mighty under mindolluin 

sea-kings’ city in the south-kingdom

foe-beleaguered  fire-encircled 

doom drove them on  darkness took them 

horse and horseman  hoofbeats afar

sank into silence  so the songs tell us 
it was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to edoras  although it
was then but noon by the hour  there he halted only a short while and
strengthened his host by some three score of riders that came late to the
weapontake  now having eaten he made ready to set out again  and he wished his
esquire a kindly farewell  but merry begged for the last time not to be parted
from him 
‘this is no journey for such steeds as stybba  as i have told you ‘ said
théoden  ‘and in such a battle as we think to make on the fields
of gondor what would you do  master meriadoc  sword-thain though you be  and
greater of heart than of stature ’
‘as for that  who can tell ’ answered merry  ‘but why  lord  did you
receive me as sword-thain  if not to stay by your side  and i would not have it
said of me in song only that i was always left behind ’
‘i received you for your safe-keeping ’ answered théoden  ‘and
also to do as i might bid  none of my riders can bear you as burden  if the
battle were before my gates  maybe your deeds would be remembered by the
minstrels  but it is a hundred leagues and two to mundburg where denethor is
lord  i will say no more ’
merry bowed and went away unhappily  and stared at the lines of horsemen 
already the companies were preparing to start  men were tightening girths 
looking to saddles  caressing their horses  some gazed uneasily at the lowering
sky  unnoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit’s ear 
‘where will wants not  a way opens  so we say ’ he whispered 
‘and so i have found myself ’ merry looked up and saw that it was the young
rider whom he had noticed in the morning  ‘you wish to go whither the lord of
the mark goes  i see it in your face ’
‘i do ’ said merry 
‘then you shall go with me ’ said the rider  ‘i will bear you before
me  under my cloak until we are far afield  and this darkness is yet darker 
such good will should not be denied  say no more to any man  but come ’
‘thank you indeed ’ said merry  ‘thank you  sir  though i do not know
your name ’
‘do you not ’ said the rider softly  ‘then call me dernhelm ’
thus it came to pass that when the king set out  before dernhelm sat meriadoc
the hobbit  and the great grey steed windfola made little of the burden  for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men  though lithe and well-knit in frame 
on into the shadow they rode  in the willow-thickets where snowbourn flowed
into entwash  twelve leagues east of edoras  they camped that night  and then on
again through the folde  and through the fenmarch  where to their right great
oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor  but away to their left the mists lay on the marshes
fed by the mouths of entwash  and as they rode rumour came of war in the north 
lone men  riding wild  brought word of foes assailing their east-borders  of
orc-hosts marching in the wold of rohan 
‘ride on  ride on ’ cried éomer  ‘too late now to turn aside 
the fens of entwash must guard our flank  haste now we need  ride on ’
and so king théoden departed from his own
realm  and mile by mile the long road wound away  and the beacon hills marched
past  calenhad  min-rimmon  erelas  nardol  but their fires were quenched  all
the lands were grey and still  and ever the shadow deepened before them 
and hope waned in every heart 
 
pippin was roused by gandalf  candles were lit in their chamber  for only a
dim twilight came through the windows  the air was heavy as with approaching
thunder 
‘what is the time ’ said pippin yawning 
‘past the second hour ’ said gandalf  ‘time to get up and make yourself
presentable  you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new
duties ’
‘and will he provide breakfast ’
‘no  i have provided it  all that you will get till noon  food is now doled
out by order ’
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and  he thought  very inadequate pat
of butter which was set out for him  beside a cup of thin milk  ‘why did you
bring me here ’ he said 
‘you know quite well ’ said gandalf  ‘to keep you out of mischief  and
if you do not like being here  you can remember that you brought it on
yourself ’ pippin said no more 
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down the cold corridor to
the door of the tower hall  there denethor sat in a grey gloom  like an old
patient spider  pippin thought  he did not seem to have moved since the day
before  he beckoned gandalf to a seat  but pippin was left for a while standing
unheeded  presently the old man turned to him 
‘well  master peregrin  i hope that you used yesterday to your profit  and
to your liking  though i fear that the board is barer in this city than you
could wish ’
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or done was
somehow known to the lord of the city  and much was guessed of what he thought
as well  he did not answer 
‘what would you do in my service ’
‘i thought  sir  that you would tell me my duties ’
‘i will  when i learn what you are fit for ’ said denethor  ‘but that i
shall learn soonest  maybe  if i keep you beside me  the esquire of my chamber
has begged leave to go to the out-garrison  so you shall take his place for a
while  you shall wait on me  bear errands  and talk to me  if war and council
leave me any leisure  can you sing ’
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘well  yes  well enough for my own people  but we
have no songs fit for great halls and evil times  lord  we seldom sing of
anything more terrible than wind or rain  and most of my songs are about things
that make us laugh  or about food and drink  of course ’
‘and why should such songs be unfit for my halls  or for such hours as
these  we who have lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes from
a land untroubled by it  then we may feel that our vigil was not fruitless 
though it may have been thankless ’
pippin’s heart sank  he did not relish the idea of singing any song of the
shire to the lord of minas tirith  certainly not the comic ones that he knew
best  they were too  well  rustic for such an occasion  he was however spared
the ordeal for the present  he was not commanded to sing  denethor turned to
gandalf  asking questions about the rohirrim and their policies  and the
position of éomer  the king’s nephew  pippin marvelled at the amount
that the lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away  though
it must  he thought  be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad 
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while  ‘go
to the armouries of the citadel ’ he said  ‘and get you there the livery and
gear of the tower  it will be ready  it was commanded yesterday  return when you
are clad ’
it was as he said  and pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garments 
all of black and silver  he had a small hauberk  its rings forged of steel 
maybe  yet black as jet  and a high-crowned helm with small raven-wings on
either side  set with a silver star in the centre of the circlet  above the mail
was a short surcoat of black  but broidered on the breast in silver with the
token of the tree  his old clothes were folded and
put away  but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of lórien  though
not to wear it when on duty  he looked now  had he known it  verily ernil
i pheriannath  the prince of the halflings  that folk had called him  but he
felt uncomfortable  and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits 
it was dark and dim all day  from the sunless dawn until evening the heavy
shadow had deepened  and all hearts in the city were oppressed  far above a
great cloud streamed slowly westward from the black land  devouring light  borne
upon a wind of war  but below the air was still and breathless  as if all the
vale of anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm 
about the eleventh hour  released at last for a while from service  pippin
came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting more supportable  in the messes he met beregond again  who
had just come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard-towers upon the
causeway  together they strolled out to the walls  for pippin felt imprisoned
indoors  and stifled even in the lofty citadel  now they sat side by side again
in the embrasure looking eastward  where they had eaten and talked the day
before 
it was the sunset-hour  but the great pall had now stretched far into the
west  and only as it sank at last into the sea did the sun escape to send out a
brief farewell gleam before the night  even as frodo saw it at the cross-roads
touching the head of the fallen king  but to the fields of the pelennor  under
the shadow of mindolluin  there came no gleam  they were brown and drear 
already it seemed years to pippin since he had sat there before  in some
half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit  a light-hearted wanderer
touched little by the perils he had passed through  now he was one small soldier
in a city preparing for a great assault  clad in the proud but sombre manner of
the tower of guard 
in some other time and place pippin might have been pleased with his new
array  but he knew now that he was taking part in no play  he was in deadly
earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril  the hauberk was
burdensome  and the helm weighed upon his head  his cloak he had cast aside upon
the seat  he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields below and
yawned  and then he sighed 
‘you are weary of this day ’ said beregond 
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘very  tired out with idleness and waiting  i have
kicked my heels at the door of my master’s chamber for many slow hours  while
he has debated with gandalf and the prince and other great persons  and i’m
not used  master beregond  to waiting hungry on others while they eat  it is a
sore trial for a hobbit  that  no doubt you will think i should feel the honour
more deeply  but what is the good of such honour  indeed what is the good even
of food and drink under this creeping shadow  what does it mean  the very air
seems thick and brown  do you often have such glooms when the wind is in the
east ’
‘nay ’ said beregond  ‘this is no weather of the world  this is some
device of his malice  some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he sends
to darken hearts and counsel  and so it doth indeed  i wish the lord faramir
would return  he would not be dismayed  but now  who knows if he will ever come
back across the river out of the darkness ’
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘gandalf  too  is anxious  he was disappointed  i
think  not to find faramir here  and where has he got to himself  he left the
lord’s council before the noon-meal  and in no good mood either  i thought 
perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news ’
suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb  frozen as it were to
listening stones  pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears  but
beregond  who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir 
remained there  stiffened  staring out with starting eyes  pippin knew the
shuddering cry that he had heard  it was the same that he had heard long ago in
the marish of the shire  but now it was grown in power and hatred  piercing the
heart with a poisonous despair 
at last beregond spoke with an effort  ‘they have come ’ he said  ‘take
courage and look  there are fell things below ’
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall  the
pelennor lay dim beneath him  fading away to the scarce guessed line of the
great river  but now wheeling swiftly across it  like shadows of untimely night 
he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms  horrible as
carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles  cruel as death  now they swooped near 
venturing almost within bowshot of the walls  now they circled away 
‘black riders ’ muttered pippin  ‘black riders of the air  but see 
beregond ’ he cried  ‘they are looking for something  surely  see how they
wheel and swoop  always down to that point over there  and can you see something
moving on the ground  dark little things  yes  men on horses  four or five  ah 
i cannot stand it  gandalf  gandalf save us ’
another long screech rose and fell  and he threw himself back again from the
wall  panting like a hunted animal  faint and seemingly remote through that
shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending on a
long high note 
‘faramir  the lord faramir  it is his call ’ cried beregond  ‘brave
heart  but how can he win to the gate  if these foul hell-hawks have other
weapons than fear  but look  they hold on  they will make the gate  no  the
horses are running mad  look  the men are thrown  they are running on foot  no 
one is still up  but he rides back to the others  that will be the captain  he
can master both beasts and men  ah  there one of the foul things is stooping on
him  help  help  will no one go out to him  faramir ’
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom  ashamed of his
terror  while beregond of the guard thought first of the captain whom he loved 
pippin got up and peered out  at that moment he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north  like a small star down on the dusky fields  it
moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came  converging swiftly with
the flight of the four men towards the gate  it seemed to pippin that a pale
light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it  and then as
it drew near he thought that he heard  like an echo in the walls  a great voice
calling 
‘gandalf ’ he cried  ‘gandalf  he always turns up when things are
darkest  go on  go on  white rider  gandalf  gandalf ’ he shouted wildly  like
an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond encouragement 
but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer  one wheeled
towards him  but it seemed to pippin that he raised his hand  and from it a
shaft of white light stabbed upwards  the nazgûl gave a long wailing cry
and swerved away  and with that the four others wavered  and then rising
in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the lowering cloud
above  and down on the pelennor it seemed for a while less dark 
pippin watched  and he saw the horseman and the white rider meet and halt 
waiting for those on foot  men now hurried out to them from the city  and soon
they all passed from sight under the outer walls  and he knew that they were
entering the gate  guessing that they would come at once to the tower and the
steward  he hurried to the entrance of the citadel  there he was joined by many
others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls 
it was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the
outer circles  and there was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir
and mithrandir  presently pippin saw torches  and followed by a press of people
two horsemen riding slowly  one was in white but shining no longer  pale in the
twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled  the other was dark and his head was
bowed  they dismounted  and as grooms took shadowfax and the other horse  they
walked forward to the sentinel at the gate  gandalf steadily  his grey cloak
flung back  and a fire still smouldering in his eyes  the other  clad all in
green  slowly  swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man 
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch 
and when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught his breath  it was the face
of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish  but has mastered it and
now is quiet  proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard 
and pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother boromir - whom
pippin had liked from the first  admiring the great man’s lordly but kindly
manner  yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling
that he had not known before  here was one with an air of high nobility such as
aragorn at times revealed  less high perhaps  yet also less incalculable and
remote  one of the kings of men born into a later time  but touched with the
wisdom and sadness of the elder race  he knew now why beregond spoke his name
with love  he was a captain that men would follow  that he would follow  even
under the shadow of the black wings 
‘faramir ’ he cried aloud with the others  ‘faramir ’ and faramir
catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city  turned and
looked down at him and was amazed 
‘whence come you ’ he said  ‘a halfling  and in the livery of the
tower  whence… ’
but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke  ‘he came with me from
the land of the halflings ’ he said  ‘he came with me  but let us not tarry
here  there is much to say and to do  and you are weary  he shall come with us 
indeed he must  for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than i do 
he must attend on his lord again within this hour  come  pippin  follow us ’
so at length they came to the private chamber of the lord of the city  there
deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal  and wine was brought  and there
pippin  hardly noticed  stood behind the chair of denethor and felt his
weariness little  so eagerly did he listen to all that was said 
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine  he sat upon a
low chair at his father’s left hand  removed a little upon the other side sat
gandalf in a chair of carven wood  and he seemed at first to be asleep  for at
the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out
ten days before  and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the
enemy and his allies  and he told of the fight on the road when the men of harad
and their great beast were overthrown  a captain reporting to his master such
matters as had often been heard before  small things of border-war that now
seemed useless and petty  shorn of their renown 
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin  ‘but now we come to strange
matters ’ he said  ‘for this is not the first halfling that i have seen
walking out of northern legends into the southlands ’
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair  but he said
nothing  and with a look stopped the exclamation on pippin’s lips  denethor
looked at their faces and nodded his head  as though in sign that he had read
much there before it was spoken  slowly  while the others sat silent and still 
faramir told his tale  with his eyes for the most part on gandalf  though now
and again his glance strayed to pippin  as if to refresh his memory of others
that he had seen 
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo and his servant and of
the events at henneth annûn  pippin became aware that gandalf’s hands
were trembling as they clutched the carven wood  white they seemed now and very
old  and as he looked at them  suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin knew
that gandalf  gandalf himself  was troubled  even afraid  the air of the room
was close and still  at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the
travellers  and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol  his voice fell  and he
shook his head and sighed  then gandalf sprang up 
‘cirith ungol  morgul vale ’ he said  ‘the time  faramir  the time 
when did you part with them  when would they reach that accursed valley ’
‘i parted with them in the morning two days ago ’ said faramir  ‘it is
fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the morgulduin  if they went straight
south  and then they would be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower 
at swiftest they could not come there before today  and maybe they have not come
there yet  indeed i see what you fear  but the darkness is not due to their
venture  it began yestereve  and all ithilien was under shadow last night  it is
clear to me that the enemy has long planned an assault on us  and its hour had
already been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping ’
gandalf paced the floor  ‘the morning of two days ago  nigh on three days
of journey  how far is the place where you parted ’
‘some twenty-five leagues as a bird flies ’ answered faramir  ‘but i
could not come more swiftly  yestereve i lay at cair andros  the long isle in
the river northward which we hold in defence  and horses are kept on the hither
bank  as the dark drew on i knew that haste was needed  so i rode thence with
three others that could also be horsed  the rest of my company i sent south to
strengthen the garrison at the fords of osgiliath  i hope that i have not done
ill ’ he looked at his father 
‘ill ’ cried denethor  and his eyes flashed suddenly  ‘why do you ask 
the men were under your command  or do you ask for my judgement on all your
deeds  your bearing is lowly in my presence  yet it is long now since you turned
from your own way at my counsel  see  you have spoken skilfully  as ever  but i 
have i not seen your eye fixed on mithrandir  seeking whether you said well or
too much  he has long had your heart in his keeping 
‘my son  your father is old but not yet dotard  i can see and hear  as was
my wont  and little of what you have half said or left unsaid is now hidden from
me  i know the answer to many riddles  alas  alas for boromir ’
‘if what i have done displeases you  my father ’ said faramir quietly 
‘i wish i had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement
was thrust on me ’
‘would that have availed to change your judgement ’ said denethor  ‘you
would still have done just so  i deem  i know you well  ever your desire is to
appear lordly and generous as a king of old  gracious  gentle  that may well
befit one of high race  if he sits in power and peace  but in desperate hours
gentleness may be repaid with death ’
‘so be it ’ said faramir 
‘so be it ’ cried denethor  ‘but not with your death only  lord
faramir  with the death also of your father  and of all your people  whom it is
your part to protect now that boromir is gone ’
‘do you wish then ’ said faramir  ‘that our places had been
exchanged ’
‘yes  i wish that indeed ’ said denethor  ‘for boromir was loyal to me
and no wizard’s pupil  he would have remembered his father’s need  and would
not have squandered what fortune gave  he would have brought me a mighty
gift ’
for a moment faramir’s restraint gave way  ‘i would ask you  my father 
to remember why it was that i  not he  was in ithilien  on one occasion at least
your counsel has prevailed  not long ago  it was the lord of the city that gave
the errand to him ’
‘stir not the bitterness in the cup that i mixed for myself ’ said
denethor  ‘have i not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue foreboding that
worse yet lay in the dregs  as now indeed i find  would it were not so  would
that this thing had come to me ’
‘comfort yourself ’ said gandalf  ‘in no case would boromir have
brought it to you  he is dead  and died well  may he sleep in peace  yet you
deceive yourself  he would have stretched out his hand to this thing  and taking
it he would have fallen  he would have kept it for his own  and when he returned
you would not have known your son ’
the face of denethor set hard and cold  ‘you found boromir less apt to your
hand  did you not ’ he said softly  ‘but i who was his father say that he
would have brought it to me  you are wise  maybe  mithrandir  yet with all your
subtleties you have not all wisdom  counsels may be found that are neither the
webs of wizards nor the haste of fools  i have in this matter more lore and
wisdom than you deem  ‘
‘what then is your wisdom ’ said gandalf 
‘enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid  to use this thing
is perilous  at this hour  to send it in the hands of a witless halfling into
the land of the enemy himself  as you have done  and this son of mine  that is
madness ’
‘and the lord denethor what would he have done ’
‘neither  but most surely not for any argument would he have set this thing
at a hazard beyond all but a fool’s hope  risking our utter ruin  if the enemy
should recover what he lost  nay  it should have been kept  hidden  hidden dark
and deep  not used  i say  unless at the uttermost end of need  but set beyond
his grasp  save by a victory so final that what then befell would not trouble
us  being dead ’
‘you think  as is your wont  my lord  of gondor only ’ said gandalf 
‘yet there are other men and other lives  and time still to be  and for me  i
pity even his slaves ’
‘and where will other men look for help  if gondor falls ’ answered
denethor  ‘if i had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel  we
should not then shake with dread under this gloom  fearing the worst  and our
counsels would be undisturbed  if you do not trust me to endure the test  you do
not know me yet ’
‘nonetheless i do not trust you ’ said gandalf  ‘had i done so  i could
have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much
anguish  and now hearing you speak i trust you less  no more than boromir  nay 
stay your wrath  i do not trust myself in this  and i refused this thing  even
as a freely given gift  you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself  denethor  yet if you had received this thing  it would have overthrown
you  were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin  still it would burn your
mind away  as the darkness grows  and the yet worse things follow that soon
shall come upon us ’
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again as he faced gandalf  and
pippin felt once more the strain between their wills  but now almost it seemed
as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye  flickering as they fenced 
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke  but suddenly denethor relaxed and
grew cold again  he shrugged his shoulders 
‘if i had  if you had ’ he said  ‘such words and ifs are vain  it has
gone into the shadow  and only time will show what doom awaits it and us  the
time will not be long  in what is left  let all who fight the enemy in their
fashion be at one  and keep hope while they may  and after hope still the
hardihood to die free ’ he turned to faramir  ‘what think you of the
garrison at osgiliath ’
‘it is not strong ’ said faramir  ‘i have sent the company of ithilien
to strengthen it  as i have said ’
‘not enough  i deem ’ said denethor  ‘it is there that the first blow
will fall  they will have need of some stout captain there ’
‘there and elsewhere in many places ’ said faramir  and sighed  ‘alas
for my brother  whom i too loved ’ he rose  ‘may i have your leave 
father ’ and then he swayed and leaned upon his father’s chair 
‘you are weary  i see ’ said denethor  ‘you have ridden fast and far 
and under shadows of evil in the air  i am told ’
‘let us not speak of that ’ said faramir 
‘then we will not ’ said denethor  ‘go now and rest as you may 
tomorrow’s need will be sterner ’
all now took leave of the lord of the city and went to rest while they still
could  outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin beside him
bearing a small torch  made his way to their lodging  they did not speak until
they were behind closed doors  then at last pippin took gandalf’s hand 
‘tell me ’ he said  ‘is there any hope  for frodo  i mean  or at least
mostly for frodo ’
gandalf put his hand on pippin’s head  ‘there never was much hope ’ he
answered  ‘just a fool’s hope  as i have been told  and when i heard of
cirith ungol---‘ he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east  ‘cirith ungol ’ he muttered  ‘why that way 
i wonder ’ he turned  ‘just now  pippin  my heart almost failed me  hearing
that name  and yet in truth i believe that the news that faramir brings has some
hope in it  for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his war at last and
made the first move while frodo was still free  so now for many days he will
have his eye turned this way and that  away from his own land  and yet  pippin 
i feel from afar his haste and fear  he has begun sooner than he would 
something has happened to stir him ’
gandalf stood for a moment in thought  ‘maybe ’ he muttered  ‘maybe
even your foolishness helped  my lad  let me see  some five days ago now he
would discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone  still
what of that  we could not use it to much purpose  or without his knowing  ah  i
wonder  aragorn  his time draws near  and he is strong and stern underneath 
pippin  bold  determined  able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at
need  that may be it  he may have used the stone and shown himself to the enemy 
challenging him  for this very purpose  i wonder  well  we shall not know the
answer till the riders of rohan come  if they do not come too late  there are
evil days ahead  to sleep while we may ’
‘but ’ said pippin 
‘but what ’ said gandalf  ‘only one but will i allow tonight ’
‘gollum ’ said pippin  ‘how on earth could they be going about with
him  even following him  and i could see that faramir did not like the place he
was taking them to any more than you do  what is wrong ’
‘i cannot answer that now ’ said gandalf  ‘yet my heart guessed that
frodo and gollum would meet before the end  for good  or for evil  but of cirith
ungol i will not speak tonight  treachery  treachery i fear  treachery of that
miserable creature  but so it must be  let us remember that a traitor may betray
himself and do good that he does not intend  it can be so  sometimes  good
night  ‘
the next day came with a morning like a brown dusk  and the hearts of men 
lifted for a while by the return of faramir  sank low again  the winged shadows
were not seen again that day  yet ever and anon  high above the city  a faint
cry would come  and many who heard it would stand stricken with a passing dread 
while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept 
and now faramir was gone again  ‘they give him no rest ’ some murmured 
‘the lord drives his son too hard  and now he must do the duty of two  for
himself and for the one that will not return ’ and ever men looked northward 
asking  ‘where are the riders of rohan ’
in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing  but the lord of the city was
master of his council  and he was in no mood that day to bow to others  early in
the morning the council had been summoned  there all the captains judged that
because of the threat in the south their force was too weak to make any stroke
of war on their own part  unless perchance the riders of rohan yet should come 
meanwhile they must man the walls and wait 
‘yet ’ said denethor  ‘we should not lightly abandon the outer
defences  the rammas made with so great a labour  and the enemy must pay dearly
for the crossing of the river  that he cannot do  in force to assail the city 
either north of cair andros because of the marshes  or southwards towards
lebennin because of the breadth of the river  that needs many boats  it is at
osgiliath that he will put his weight  as before when boromir denied him the
passage ’
‘that was but a trial ’ said faramir  ‘today we may make the enemy pay
ten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange  for he can afford to
lose a host better than we to lose a company  and the retreat of those that we
put out far afield will be perilous  if he wins across in force ’
‘and what of cair andros ’ said the prince  ‘that  too  must be held 
if osgiliath is defended  let us not forget the danger on our left  the rohirrim
may come  and they may not  but faramir has told us of great strength drawing
ever to the black gate  more than one host may issue from it  and strike for
more than one passage ’
‘much must be risked in war ’ said denethor  ‘cair andros is manned and
no more can be sent so far  but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do his
lord’s will ’
then all were silent  but at length faramir said  ‘i do not oppose your
will  sire  since you are robbed of boromir  i will go and do what i can in his
stead - if you command it ’
‘i do so ’ said denethor 
‘then farewell ’ said faramir  ‘but if i should return  think better of
me ’
‘that depends on the manner of your return ’ said denethor 
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east  ‘do not throw
your live away rashly or in bitterness ’ he said  ‘you will be needed here 
for other things than war  your father loves you  faramir  and will remember it
ere the end  farewell ’
so now the lord faramir had gone forth again  and had taken with him such
strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared  on the walls some
gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city  and they wondered what chanced
there  for nothing could be seen  and others  as
ever  looked north and counted the leagues to théoden in rohan  ‘will
he come  will he remember our old alliance ’ they said 
‘yes  he will come ’ said gandalf  ‘even if he comes too late  but
think  at best the red arrow cannot have reached him more than two days ago  and
the miles are long from edoras ’
it was night again ere news came  a man rode in haste from the fords  saying
that a host had issued from minas morgul and was already drawing nigh to
osgiliath  and it had been joined by regiments from the south  haradrim  cruel
and tall  ‘and we have learned ‘ said the messenger  ‘that the black
captain leads them once again  and the fear of him has passed before him over
the river ’
with those ill-boding words the third day closed since pippin came to minas
tirith  few went to rest  for small hope had any now that even faramir could
hold the fords for long 
the next day  though the darkness had reached its full and grew no deeper  it
weighed heavier on men’s hearts  and a great dread was on them  ill news came
soon again  the passage of anduin was won by the enemy  faramir was retreating
to the wall of the pelennor  rallying his men to the causeway forts  but he was
ten times outnumbered 
‘if he wins back at all across the pelennor  his enemies will be on his
heels ’ said the messenger  ‘they have paid dear for the crossing but less
dearly than we hoped  the plan has been well laid  it is now seen that in secret
they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in east
osgiliath  they swarmed across like beetles  but it is the black captain that
defeats us  few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming  his own folk
quail at him  and they would slay themselves at his bidding ’
‘then i am needed there more than here ’ said gandalf  and rode off at
once  and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight  and all that night pippin
alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward 
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again  a mockery in the unlightened
dark  when far away he saw fires spring up  across in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood  the watchmen cried aloud  and all men in the city
stood to arms  now ever and anon there was a red flash  and slowly through the
heavy air dull rumbles could be heard 
‘they have taken the wall ’ men cried  ‘they are blasting breaches in
it  they are coming ’
‘where is faramir ’ cried beregond in dismay  ‘say not that he has
fallen ’
it was gandalf that brought the first tidings  with a handful of horsemen he
came in the middle morning  riding as escort to a line of wains  they were
filled with wounded men  all that could be saved from the wreck of the causeway
forts  at once he went to denethor  the lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side  and through
the dim windows  north and south and east  he bent his dark eyes  as if to
pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round  most to the north he looked 
and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might
hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away 
‘is faramir come ’ he asked 
‘no ’ said gandalf  ‘but he still lived when i left him  yet he is
resolved to stay with the rearguard  lest the retreat over the pelennor become a
rout  he may  perhaps  hold his men together long enough  but i doubt it  he is
pitted against a foe too great  for one has come that i feared ’
‘not - the dark lord ’ cried pippin  forgetting his place in his terror 
denethor laughed bitterly  ‘nay  not yet  master peregrin  he will not come
save only to triumph over me when all is won  he uses others as his weapons  so
do all great lords  if they are wise  master halfling  or why should i sit here
in my tower and think  and watch  and wait  spending even my sons  for i can
still wield a brand ’
he stood up and cast open his long black cloak  and behold  he was clad in
mail beneath  and girt with a long sword  great-hilted in a sheath of black and
silver  ‘thus have i walked  and thus now for many years have i slept ’ he
said  ‘lest with age the body should grow soft and timid ’
‘yet now under the lord of barad-dûr the most fell of all his
captains is already master of your outer walls ’ said gandalf  ‘king of
angmar long ago  sorcerer  ringwraith  lord of the nazgûl  a spear of
terror in the hand of sauron  shadow of despair ’
‘then  mithrandir  you had a foe to match you ’ said denethor  ‘for
myself  i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark
tower  is this all that you have returned to say  or can it be that you have
withdrawn because you are overmatched ’
pippin trembled  fearing that gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath  but his
fear was needless  ‘it might be so ’ gandalf answered softly  ‘but our
trial of strength is not yet come  and if words spoken of old be true  not by
the hand of man shall he fall  and hidden from the wise is the doom that awaits
him  however that may be  the captain of despair does not press forward  yet  he
rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just spoken  from the rear 
driving his slaves in madness on before 
‘nay  i came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed  for the
rammas is breached far and wide  and soon the host of morgul will enter in at
many points  and i came chiefly to say this  soon there will be battle on the
fields  a sortie must be made ready  let it be of mounted men  in them lies our
brief hope  for in one thing only is the enemy still poorly provided  he has few
horsemen ’
‘and we also have few  now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of
time ’ said denethor 
‘we are likely to see other newcomers first ’ said gandalf  ‘fugitives
from cair andros have already reached us  the isle has fallen  another army is
come from the black gate  crossing from the north-east ’
‘some have accused you  mithrandir  of delighting to bear ill news ’ said
denethor  ‘but to me this is no longer news  it was known to mw ere nightfall
yesterday  as for the sortie  i had already given thought to it  let us go
down ’
time passed  at length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of the
out-companies  small bands of weary and often wounded men came first with little
order  some were running wildly as if pursued  away to the eastward the distant
fires flickered  and now it seemed that here and there they crept across the
plain  houses and barns were burning  then from many points little rivers of red
flame came hurrying on  winding through the gloom  converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the city-gate to osgiliath 
‘the enemy ’ men murmured  ‘the dike is down  here they come pouring
through the breaches  and they carry torches  it seems  where are our own
folk ’
it drew now to evening by the hour  and the light was so dim that even
far-sighted men upon the citadel could discern little clearly out upon the
fields  save only the burnings that ever multiplied  and the lines of fire that
grew in length and speed  at last  less than a mile from the city  a more
ordered mass of men came into view  marching not running  still holding
together 
the watchers held their breath  ‘faramir must be there ’ they said  ‘he
can govern man and beast  he will make it yet ’
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant  out of the gloom
behind a small company of horsemen galloped  all that was left of the rearguard 
once again they turned at bay  facing the oncoming lines of fire  then suddenly
there was a tumult of fierce cries  horsemen of the enemy swept up  the lines of
fire became flowing torrents  file upon file of
orcs bearing flames  and wild southron men with red banners  shouting with harsh
tongues  surging up  overtaking the retreat  and with a piercing cry out of the
dim sky fell the winged shadows  the nazgûl stooping to the kill 
the retreat became a rout  already men were breaking away  flying wild and
witless here and there  flinging away their weapons  crying out in fear  falling
to the ground 
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel  and denethor at last released the
sortie  drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under the looming walls
outside they had waited for his signal  all the mounted men that were left in
the city  now they sprang forward  formed  quickened to a gallop  and charged
with a great shout  and from the walls an answering shout went up  for foremost
on the field rode the swan-knights of dol amroth with their prince and his blue
banner at their head 
‘amroth for gondor ’ they cried  ‘amroth to faramir ’
like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat  but
one rider outran them all  swift as the wind in the grass  shadowfax bore him 
shining  unveiled once more  a light starting from his upraised hand 
the nazgûl screeched and swept away  for their captain was not yet come
to challenge the white fire of his foe  the hosts of morgul intent on
their prey  taken at unawares in wild career  broke  scattering like sparks in a
gale  the out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers 
hunters became the hunted  the retreat became an onslaught  the field was strewn
with stricken orcs and men  and a reek arose of torches cast away  sputtering
out in swirling smoke  the cavalry rode on 
but denethor did not permit them to go far  though the enemy was checked  and
for the moment driven back  great forces were flowing in from the east  again
the trumpet rang  sounding the retreat  the cavalry of gondor halted  behind
their screen the out-companies re-formed  now steadily they came marching back 
they reached the gate of the city and entered  stepping proudly  and proudly the
people of the city looked on them and cried their praise  and yet they were
troubled in heart  for the companies were grievously reduced  faramir had lost a
third of his men  and where was he 
last of all he came  his men passed in  the mounted knights returned  and at
their rear the banner of dol amroth  and the prince  and in his arms before him
on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman  faramir son of denethor  found
upon the stricken field 
‘faramir  faramir ’ men cried  weeping in
the streets  but he did not answer  and they bore him away up the winding road
to the citadel and his father  even as the nazgûl had swerved aside from
the onset of the white rider  there came flying a deadly dart  and faramir  as
he held at bay a mounted champion of harad  had fallen to the earth  only
the charge of dol amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would
have hewed him as he lay 
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower  and he said  your son
has returned  lord  after great deeds  and he told all that he had seen  but
denethor rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent  then he bade
them make a bed in the chamber and lay faramir upon it and depart  but he
himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit of the tower  and
many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleamed and
flickered from the narrow windows for a while  and then flashed and went out 
and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and sat beside him without
speaking  but the face of the lord was grey  more deathlike than his son’s 
so now at last the city was besieged  enclosed in a ring of foes  the rammas
was broken  and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy  the last word to come
from outside the walls was brought by men flying
down the northward road ere the gate was shut  they were the remnant of the
guard that was kept at that point where the way from anórien and rohan
ran into the townlands  ingold led them  the same who had admitted gandalf
and pippin less than five days before  while the sun still rose and there was
hope in the morning 
‘there is no news of the rohirrim ’ he said  ‘rohan will not come now 
or if they come  it will not avail us  the new host that we had tidings of has
come first  from over the river by way of andros  it is said  they are strong 
battalions of orcs of the eye  and countless companies of men of a new sort that
we have not met before  not tall  but broad and grim  bearded like dwarves 
wielding great axes  out of some savage land in the
wide east they come  we deem  they hold the northward road  and many have passed
on into anórien  the rohirrim cannot come ’
the gate was shut  all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of the
enemy that roamed outside  burning field and tree  and hewing any man that they
found abroad  living or dead  the numbers that had already passed over the river
could not be guessed in the darkness  but when morning  or its dim shadow  stole
over the plain  it was seen that even fear by night had scarcely over-counted
them  the plain was dark with their marching companies  and as far as eyes could
strain in the mirk there sprouted  like a foul fungus-growth  all about the
beleaguered city great camps of tents  black or sombre red 
busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging  digging lines of deep trenches in a
huge ring  just out of bowshot from the walls  and as the trenches were made
each was filled with fire  though how it was kindled or fed  by art or devilry 
none could see  all day the labour went forward  while the men of minas tirith
looked on  unable to hinder it  and as each length of trench was completed  they
could see great wains approaching  and soon yet more companies of the enemy were
swiftly setting up  each behind the cover of a trench  great engines for the
casting of missiles  there were none upon the city walls large enough to reach
so far or to stay the work 
at first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices  for the main wall
of the city was of great height and marvellous
thickness  built ere the power and craft of númenor waned in exile  and
its outward face was like to the tower of orthanc  hard and dark and smooth 
unconquerable by steel or fire  unbreakable except by some convulsion that would
rend the very earth on which it stood 
‘nay ’ they said  ‘not if the nameless one himself should come  not
even he could enter here while we yet live ’ but some answered  ‘while we
yet live  how long  he has a weapon that has brought low many strong places
since the world began  hunger  the roads are cut  rohan will not come ’
but the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall  it was no
brigand or orc-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the lord of mordor’s
greatest foe  a power and mind of malice guided it  as soon as the great
catapults were set  with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch  they
began to throw missiles marvellously high  so that they passed right above the
battlement and fell thudding within the first circle of the city  and many of
them by some secret art burst into flame as they came toppling down 
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall  and all who could be
spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places  then among
the greater casts there fell another hail  less ruinous but more horrible  all
about the streets and lanes behind the gate it tumbled down  small round shot
that did not burn  but when men ran to learn what it might be  they cried aloud
or wept  for the enemy was flinging into the city all the heads of those who had
fallen fighting at osgiliath  or on the rammas  or in the fields  they were grim
to look on  for though some were crushed and shapeless  and some had been
cruelly hewn  yet many had features that could be told  and it seemed that they
had died in pain  and all were branded with the foul token of the lidless eye 
but marred and dishonoured as they were  it often chanced that thus a man would
see again the face of someone that he had known  who had walked proudly once in
arms  or tilled the fields  or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vales in
the hills 
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before the
gate  curses they heeded not  nor understood the tongues of western men  crying
with harsh voices like beasts and carrion-birds  but soon there were few left in
minas tirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor  for yet
another weapon  swifter than hunger  the lord of the dark tower had  dread and
despair 
the nazgûl came again  and as their dark lord now grew and put
forth his strength  so their voices  which uttered only his will and his malice 
were filled with evil and horror  ever they circled above the city  like
vultures that expect their fill of doomed men’s flesh  out of sight and shot
they flew  and yet were ever present  and their deadly voices rent the air  more
unbearable they became  not less  at each new cry  at length even the
stout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace passed
over them  or they would stand  letting their weapons fall from nerveless hands
while into their minds a blackness came  and they thought no more of war  but
only of hiding and of crawling  and of death 
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed in the chamber of the
white tower  wandering in a desperate fever  dying someone said  and soon
‘dying’ all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets  and by him
his father sat  and said nothing  but watched  and gave no longer any heed to
the defence 
no hours so dark had pippin known  not even in the clutches of the uruk-hai 
it was his duty to wait upon the lord  and wait he did  forgotten it seemed 
standing by the door of the unlit chamber  mastering his own fears as best he
could  and as he watched  it seemed to him that denethor grew old before his
eyes  as if something had snapped in his proud will  and his stern mind was
overthrown  grief maybe had wrought it  and remorse  he saw tears on that once
tearless face  more unbearable than wrath 
‘do not weep  lord ’ he stammered  ‘perhaps he will get well  have you
asked gandalf ’
‘comfort me not with wizards ’ said denethor  ‘the fool’s hope has
failed  the enemy has found it  and now his power waxes  he sees our very
thoughts  and all we do is ruinous 
‘i sent my son forth  unthanked  unblessed  out into needless peril  and
here he lies with poison in his veins  nay  nay  whatever may now betide in war 
my line too is ending  even the house of the stewards has failed  mean folk
shall rule the last remnant of the kings of men  lurking in the hills until all
are hounded out ’
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city  ‘nay  i will not come
down ’ he said  ‘i must stay beside my son  he might still speak before the
end  but that is near  follow whom you will  even the grey fool  though his hope
has failed  here i stay ’
so it was that gandalf took command of the last defence of the city of
gondor  wherever he came men’s hearts would lift again  and the winged shadows
pass from memory  tirelessly he strode from citadel
to gate  from north to south about the wall  and with him went the prince of dol
amroth in his shining mail  for he and his knights still held themselves like
lords in whom the race of númenor ran true  men that saw them whispered
saying  ‘belike the old tales speak well  there is elvish blood in the
veins of that folk  for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long
ago ’ and then one would sing amid the gloom some staves of the lay of
nimrodel  or other songs of the vale of anduin out of vanished years 
and yet - when they had gone  the shadows closed on men again  and their
hearts went cold  and the valour of gondor withered into ash  and so slowly they
passed out of a dim day of fears into the darkness of a desperate night  fires
now raged unchecked in the first circle of the city  and the garrison upon the
outer wall was already in many places cut off from retreat  but the faithful who
remained there at their posts were few  most had fled beyond the second gate 
far behind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged  and all day more
force and gear of war had poured across  now at last in the middle night the
assault was loosed  the vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by many
devious paths that had been left between them  on they came  reckless of their
loss as they approached  still bunched and herded  within the range of bowmen on
the wall  but indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage 
though the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of such skill as
gondor once had boasted  then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beaten down  the hidden captain put forth his strength  slowly the great
siege-towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark 
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower  and pippin let them
enter  for they were urgent  denethor turned his head slowly from faramir’s
face  and looked at them silently 
‘the first circle of the city is burning  lord ’ they said  ‘what are
your commands  you are still the lord and steward  not all will follow
mithrandir  men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned ’
‘why  why do the fools fly ’ said denethor  ‘better to burn sooner than
late  for burn we must  go back to your bonfire  and i  i will go now to my
pyre  to my pyre  no tomb for denethor and faramir  no tomb  no long slow sleep
of death embalmed  we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed
hither from the west  the west has failed  go back and burn ’
the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled 
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of faramir that he had
held  ‘he is burning  already burning ’ he said sadly  ‘the house of his
spirit crumbles ’ then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him 
‘farewell ’ he said  ‘farewell  peregrin son of paladin  your service
has been short  and now it is drawing to an end  i release you from the little
that remains  go now  and die in what way seems best to you  and with whom you
will  even that friend whose folly brought you to this death  send for my
servants and then go  farewell ’
‘i will not say farewell  my lord ’ said pippin kneeling  and then
suddenly hobbit-like once more  he stood up and looked the old man in the eyes 
‘i will take your leave  sir ’ he said  ‘for i want to see gandalf very
much indeed  but he is no fool  and i will not think of dying until he despairs
of life  but from my word and your service i do not wish to be released while
you live  and if they come at last to the citadel  i hope to be here and stand
beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me ’
‘do as you will  master halfling ’ said denethor  ‘but my life is
broken  send for my servants ’ he turned back to faramir 
pippin left him and called for the servants  and they came  six men of the
household  strong and fair  yet they trembled at the summons  but in a quiet
voice denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramir’s bed and take it up 
and they did so  and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber  slowly
they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be  and denethor  now
bending on a staff  followed them  and last came pippin 
out from the white tower they walked  as if to a funeral  out into the
darkness  where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull red 
softly they paced the great courtyard  and at a word from denethor halted beside
the withered tree 
all was silent  save for the rumour of war in the city down below  and they
heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool  then
they went on through the citadel gate  where the sentinel stared at them in
wonder and dismay as they passed by  turning westward they came at length to a
door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle  fen hollen it was called  for it
was kept ever shut save at times of funeral  and only the lord of the city might
use that way  or those who bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of
the dead  beyond it went a winding road that descended in many curves down to
the narrow land under the shadow of mindolluin’s precipice where stood the
mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards 
a porter sat in a little house beside the way  and with fear in his eyes he
came forth bearing a lantern in his hand  at the lord’s command he unlocked
the door  and silently it swung back  and they passed through  taking the
lantern from his hand  it was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many-pillared balusters looming in the swaying lantern-beam  their slow feet
echoed as they walked down  down  until at last they came to the silent street 
rath dínen  between pale domes and empty halls and images of men long
dead  and they entered into the house of the stewards and set down their burden 
there pippin  staring uneasily about him  saw that he was in a wide vaulted
chamber  draped as it were with the great shadows that the little lantern threw
upon its shrouded walls  and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables  carved
of marble  and upon each table lay a sleeping form  hands folded  head pillowed
upon stone  but one table near at hand stood broad and bare  upon it at a sign
from denethor they laid faramir and his father side by side  and covered them
with one covering  and stood then with bowed heads as mourners beside a bed of
death  then denethor spoke in a low voice 
‘here we will wait ’ he said  ‘but send not for the embalmers  bring us
wood quick to burn  and lay it all about us  and beneath  and pour oil upon it 
and when i bid you thrust in a torch  do this and speak no more to me 
farewell ’
‘by your leave  lord ’ said pippin and turned and fled in terror from the
deathly house  ‘poor faramir ’ he thought  ‘i must find gandalf  poor
faramir  quite likely he needs medicine more than tears  oh  where can i find
gandalf  in the thick of things  i suppose  and he will have no time to spare
for dying men or madmen ’
at the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard there 
‘your master is not himself ’ he said  ‘go slow  bring no fire to this
place while faramir lives  do nothing until gandalf comes ’
‘who is the master of minas tirith ’ the man answered  ‘the lord
denethor or the grey wanderer ’
‘the grey wanderer or no one  it would seem ’ said pippin  and he sped
back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him  past the
astonished porter  out through the door  and on  till he came near the gate of
the citadel  the sentinel hailed him as he went by  and he recognized the voice
of beregond 
‘whither do you run  master peregrin ’ he cried 
‘to find mithrandir ’ pippin answered 
‘the lord’s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me ’ said
beregond  ‘but tell me quickly  if you may  what goes forward  whither has my
lord gone  i have just come on duty  but i heard that he passed towards the
closed door  and men were bearing faramir before him ’
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘to the silent street ’
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears  ‘they said that he was dying ’
he sighed  ‘and now he is dead ’
‘no ’ said pippin  ‘not yet  and even now his death might be prevented 
i think  but the lord of the city  beregond  has fallen before his city is
taken  he is fey and dangerous ’ quickly he told of denethor’s strange words
and deeds  ‘i must find gandalf at once ’
‘then you must go down to the battle ’
‘i know  the lord has given me leave  but  beregond  if you can  do
something to stop any dreadful thing happening ’
‘the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave
their post for any cause  save at his own command ’
‘well  you must choose between orders and the life of faramir ’ said
pippin  ‘and as for orders  i think you have a madman to deal with  not a
lord  i must run  i will return if i can ’
he ran on  down  down towards the outer city  men flying back from the
burning passed him  and some seeing his livery turned and shouted  but he paid
no heed  at last he was through the second gate  beyond which great fires leaped
up between the walls  yet it seemed strangely silent  no noise or shouts of
battle or din of arms could be heard  then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and
a great shock  and a deep echoing boom  forcing himself on against a gust of
fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees  pippin turned a corner
opening on the wide place behind the city gate  he stopped dead  he had found
gandalf  but he shrank back  cowering into a shadow 
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on  the drums rolled 
to the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy pressed to the
walls  there came great beasts  like moving houses in the red and fitful light 
the mûmakil of the harad
dragging through the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines  yet their
captain cared not greatly what they did or how many might be slain  their
purpose was only to test the strength of the defence and to keep the men of
gondor busy in many places  it was against the gate that he would throw his
heaviest weight  very strong it might be  wrought of steel and iron  and guarded
with towers and bastions of indomitable stone  yet it was the key  the weakest
point in all that high and impenetrable wall 
the drums rolled louder  fires leaped up  great engines crawled across the
field  and in the midst was a huge ram  great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in
length  swinging on mighty chains  long had it been forging in the dark smithies
of mordor  and its hideous head  founded of black steel  was shaped in the
likeness of a ravening wolf  on it spells of ruin lay  grond they named it  in
memory of the hammer of the underworld of old  great beasts drew it  orcs
surrounded it  and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it 
but about the gate resistance still was stout  and there the knights of dol
amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay  shot and dart fell thick 
siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches  all before the walls on
either side of the gate the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of the
slain  yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up 
grond crawled on  upon its housing no fire would catch  and though now and
again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping ruin
among the orcs innumerable that guarded it  their bodies were cast aside from
its path and others took their place 
grond crawled on  the drums rolled wildly  over the hills of slain a hideous
shape appeared  a horseman  tall  hooded  cloaked in black  slowly  trampling
the fallen  he rode forth  heeding no longer any dart  he halted and held up a
long pale sword  and as he did so a great fear fell on all  defender and foe
alike  and the hands of men drooped to their sides  and no bow sang  for a
moment all was still 
the drums rolled and rattled  with a vast rush grond was hurled forward by
huge hands  it reached the gate  it swung  a deep boom rumbled through the city
like thunder running in the clouds  but the doors of iron and posts of steel
withstood the stroke 
then the black captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful
voice  speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both
heart and stone 
thrice he cried  thrice the great ram boomed  and suddenly upon the last
stroke the gate of gondor broke  as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst
asunder  there was a flash of searing lightning  and the doors tumbled in riven
fragments to the ground 
in rode the lord of the nazgûl  a great black shape against the fires
beyond he loomed up  grown to a vast menace of despair  in rode the lord of the
nazgûl  under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed  and
all fled before his face 
all save one  there waiting  silent and still in the space before the gate 
sat gandalf upon shadowfax  shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the
earth endured the terror  unmoving  steadfast as a graven image in
rath dínen 
‘you cannot enter here ’ said gandalf  and the huge shadow halted  ‘go
back to the abyss prepared for you  go back  fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master  go ’
the black rider flung back his hood  and behold  he had a kingly crown  and
yet upon no head visible was it set  the red fires shone between it and the
mantled shoulders vast and dark  from a mouth unseen there came a deadly
laughter 
‘old fool ’ he said  ‘old fool  this is my hour  do you not know death
when you see it  die now and curse in vain ’ and with that he lifted high his
sword and flames ran down the blade 
gandalf did not move  and in that very moment  away behind in some courtyard
of the city  a cock crowed  shrill and clear he crowed  recking nothing of
wizardry or war  welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the
shadows of death was coming with the dawn 
and as if in answer there came from far away another note  horns  horns 
horns  in dark mindolluin’s sides they dimly echoed  great horns of the north
wildly blowing  rohan had come at last 
 
it was dark and merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled in a
blanket  yet though the night was airless and windless  all about him hidden
trees were sighing softly  he lifted his head  then he heard it again  a sound
like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain-steps  the throb would cease
suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point  now nearer  now further
off  he wondered if the watchmen had heard it 
he could not see them  but he knew that all round him were the companies of
the rohirrim  he could smell the horses in the dark  and could hear their
shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground  the host was
bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about
eilenach beacon  a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the drúadan
forest that lay beside the great road in east anórien 
tired as he was merry could not sleep  he had ridden now for four days on
end  and the ever-deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart  he began to
wonder why he had been so eager to come  when he had been given every excuse 
even his lord’s command  to stay behind  he wondered  too  if the old king
knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry  perhaps not  there seemed to be
some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelm  the marshal who commanded the éored
in which they were riding  he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not to
hear if he spoke  he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was
carrying  dernhelm was no comfort  he never spoke to anyone  merry felt small 
unwanted  and lonely  now the time was anxious  and the host was in peril  they
were less than a day’s ride from the out-walls of minas tirith that encircled
the townlands  scouts had been sent ahead  some had not returned  others
hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them  a host
of the enemy was encamped upon it  three miles west of amon dîn  and some
strength of men was already thrusting along the road and was no more than three
leagues away  orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside  the
king and éomer held council in the watches of the night 
merry wanted somebody to talk to  and he thought of pippin  but
that only increased his restlessness  poor pippin  shut up in the great city of
stone  lonely and afraid  merry wished he was a tall rider like éomer and
could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue  he sat up 
listening to the drums that were beating again  now nearer at hand 
presently he heard voices speaking low  and he saw dim half-shrouded lanterns
passing through the trees  men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark 
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him  cursing the tree-roots  he
recognized the voice of the marshal  elfhelm 
‘i am not a tree-root  sir ’ he said  ‘nor a bag  but a bruised hobbit 
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot ’
‘anything that can keep so in this devil’s mirk ’ answered elfhelm 
‘but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness  orders may
come for a sudden move ’
‘is the enemy coming then ’ asked merry anxiously  ‘are those their
drums  i began to think i was imagining them  as no one else seemed to take any
notice of them ’
‘nay  nay ’ said elfhelm  ‘the enemy is on the road not in the hills 
you hear the woses  the wild men of the woods  thus they talk together from
afar  they still haunt drúadan forest  it is said  remnants of an older
time they be  living few and secretly  wild and wary as the beasts  they
go not to war with gondor or the mark  but now they are troubled by the darkness
and the coming of the orcs  they fear lest the dark years be returning  as seems
likely enough  let us be thankful that they are not
hunting us  for they use poisoned arrows  it is said  and they are woodcrafty
beyond compare  but they have offered their services to théoden  even now
one of their headmen is being taken to the king  yonder go the lights  so much i
have heard but no more  and now i must busy myself with my lord’s
commands  pack yourself up  master bag ’ he vanished into the shadows 
merry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts  but quite apart
from that a great weight of dread was on him  waiting was unbearable  he longed
to know what was going to happen  he got up and soon was walking warily in
pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees 
presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up for the
king under a great tree  a large lantern  covered
above  was hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below  there sat
théoden and éomer  and before them on the ground sat a strange
squat shape of a man  gnarled as an old stone  and the hairs of his scanty beard
straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss  he was short-legged and fat-armed 
thick and stumpy  and clad only with grass about his waist  merry felt that he
had seen him before somewhere  and suddenly he remembered the púkel-men
of dunharrow  here was one of those old images brought to life  or maybe
a creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used by
the forgotten craftsmen long ago 
there was a silence as merry crept nearer  and then the wild man began to
speak  in answer to some question  it seemed  his voice was deep and guttural 
yet to merry’s surprise he spoke the common speech  though in a halting
fashion  and uncouth words were mingled with it 
‘no  father of horse-men ’ he said  ‘we fight not  hunt only  kill gorgûn
in woods  hate orc-folk  you hate gorgûn
too  we help as we can  wild men have long ears and long eyes  know all paths 
wild men live here before stone-houses  before tall men come up out of water ’
‘but our need is for aid in battle ’ said éomer  ‘how will
you and your folk help us ’
‘bring news ’ said the wild man  ‘we look out from hills  we climb big
mountain and look down  stone-city is shut  fire burns there outside  now inside
too  you wish to come there  then you must be quick  but gorgûn
and men out of far-away ’ he waved a short gnarled arm eastward  ‘sit on
horse-road  very many  more than horse-men ’
‘how do you know that ’ said éomer 
the old man’s flat face and dark eyes showed nothing  but his voice was
sullen with displeasure  ‘wild men are wild 
free  but not children ’ he answered  ‘i am great headman  ghân-buri-ghân 
i count many things  stars in sky  leaves on trees  men in the dark  you have a
score of scores counted ten times and five  they have more  big fight  and who
will win  and many more walk round walls of stone-houses ’
‘alas  he speaks all too shrewdly ’ said théoden  ‘and our
scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road  we cannot
sweep them away in sudden onset ’
‘and yet we need great haste ’ said éomer  ‘mundburg is
on fire ’
‘let ghân-buri-ghân finish ’ said the wild man  ‘more than
one road he knows  he will lead you by road where no pits are  no gorgûn
walk  only wild men and beasts  many paths were made when stonehouse-folk were
stronger  they carved hills as hunters carve
beast-flesh  wild men think they ate stone for food  they went through drúadan
to rimmon with great wains  they go no longer  road is forgotten  but not by
wild men  over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass and tree  there
behind rimmon and down to dîn  and back at the end to horse-men’s road 
wild men will show you that road  then you will kill gorgûn
and drive away bad dark with bright iron  and wild men can go back to sleep in
the wild woods ’
éomer and the king spoke together in their own tongue  at length théoden
turned to the wild man  ‘we will receive your offer ’ he said  ‘for though
we leave a host of foes behind  what matter  if the stone-city falls  then we
shall have no returning  if it is saved  then the orc-host itself will be cut
off  if you are faithful  ghân-buri-ghân  then we will give you rich
reward  and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever ’
‘dead men are not friends to living men  and give them no gifts ’ said
the wild man  ‘but if you live after the
darkness  then leave wild men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like
beasts any more  ghân-buri-ghân will not lead you into trap  he will
go himself with father of horse-men  and if he leads you wrong  you will kill
him ’
‘so be it ’ said théoden 
‘how long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road ’
asked éomer  ‘we must go at foot-pace  if you guide us  and i doubt not
the way is narrow ’
‘wild men go quick on feet ’ said ghân  ‘way is wide for four
horses in stonewain valley yonder ’ he waved his hand southwards  ‘but
narrow at beginning and at end  wild man could walk from here to dîn
between sunrise and noon ’
‘then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders ’ said éomer 
‘but we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all  things unforeseen
may hinder us  and if our host is all strung out  it will be long ere it can be
set in order when we issue from the hills  what is the hour now ’
‘who knows ’ said théoden  ‘all is night now ’
‘it is all dark  but it is not all night ’
said ghân  ‘when sun comes we feel her  even when she is hidden  already
she climbs over east-mountains  it is the opening of day in the sky-fields ’
‘then we must set out as soon as may be ’ said éomer  ‘even so
we cannot hope to come to gondor’s aid today ’
merry waited to hear no more  but slipped away to get ready for the summons
to the march  this was the last stage before the battle  it did not seem likely
to him that many of them would survive it  but he thought of pippin and the
flames in minas tirith and thrust down his own dread 
all went well that day  and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting
to waylay them  the wild men had put out a screen of wary hunters  so that no
orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the
hills  the light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered
city  and the riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses 
each company was guided by a wild woodman  but old ghân walked beside the
king  the start had been slower than was hoped  for it had taken time for
the riders  walking and leading their horses  to find paths over the thickly
wooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valley  it
was late in the afternoon when the leaders came to
wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of amon dîn  and
masking a great gap in the line of hills that from nardol to dîn ran east
and west  through the gap the forgotten wain-road long ago had run down  back
into the main horse-way from the city through anórien  but now for many
lives of men trees had had their way with it  and it had vanished  broken and
buried under the leaves of uncounted years  but the thickets offered to the
riders their last hope of cover before they went into open battle  for
beyond them lay the road and the plains of anduin  while east and southwards the
slopes were bare and rocky  as the writhen hills gathered themselves together
and climbed up  bastion upon bastion  into the great mass and shoulders of
mindolluin 
the leading company was halted  and as those behind filed up out of the
trough of the stonewain valley they spread out and passed to camping-places
under the grey trees  the king summoned the captains to council  éomer
sent out scouts to spy upon the road  but old ghân shook his head 
‘no good to send horse-men ’ he said  ‘wild men have already seen all
that can be seen in the bad air  they will come soon and speak to me here ’
the captains came  and then out of the trees crept warily other púkel-shapes
so like old ghân that merry could hardly tell them apart  they spoke to ghân
in a strange throaty language 
presently ghân turned to the king  ‘wild men say many things ‘ he
said  ‘first  be wary  still many men in camp beyond dîn  an hour’s
walk yonder ’ he waved his arm west towards the black beacon  ‘but
none to see between here and stone-folk’s new walls  many busy there  walls
stand up no longer  gorgûn
knock them down with earth-thunder and with clubs of black iron  they are unwary
and do not look about them  they think their
friends watch all roads ’ at that old ghân made a curious gurgling
noise  and it seemed that he was laughing 
‘good tidings ’ cried éomer  ‘even in this gloom hope gleams
again  our enemy’s devices oft serve us in his despite  the accursed
darkness itself has been a cloak to us  and now  lusting to destroy gondor and
throw it down stone from stone  his orcs have taken away my greatest fear  the
out-wall could have been held long against us  now we can sweep through - if
once we win so far ’
‘once again i thank you  ghân-buri-ghân of the woods ’ said
théoden  ‘good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance ’
‘kill gorgûn 
kill orc-folk  no other words please wild men ‘ answered ghân  ‘drive
away bad air and darkness with bright iron ’
‘to do these things we have ridden far ’ said the king  ‘and we shall
attempt them  but what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show ’
ghân-buri-ghân squatted down and touched the earth with his horny
brow in token of farewell  then he got up as if to depart  but suddenly
he stood looking up like some startled woodland animal snuffling a strange air 
a light came in his eyes 
‘wind is changing ’ he cried  and with that  in a twinkling as it seemed 
he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms  never to be seen by any rider
of rohan again  not long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbed again 
yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the wild men were unfaithful 
strange and unlovely though they might appear 
‘we need no further guidance ’ said elfhelm  ‘for there are riders in
the host who have ridden down to mundburg in days of peace  i for one  when we
come to the road it will veer south  and there will lie before us still seven
leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands  along most of that way there is
much grass on either side of the road  on that stretch the errand-riders of
gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed  we may ride it swiftly and without
great rumour ’
‘then since we must look for fell deeds and the need
of all our strength ’ said éomer  ‘i counsel that we rest now  and
set out hence by night  and so time our going that we come upon the fields when
tomorrow is as light as it will be  or when our lord gives the signal ’
to this the king assented  and the captains departed  but soon elfhelm
returned  ‘the scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey wood 
lord ’ he said  ‘save two men only  two dead men and two dead horses ’
‘well ’ said éomer  ‘what of it ’
‘this  lord  they were errand-riders of gondor  hirgon was one maybe  at
least his hand still clasped the red arrow  but his head was hewn off  and this
also  it would seem by the signs that they were fleeing westward when
they fell  as i read it  they found the enemy already on the out-wall  or
assailing it  when they returned - and that would be two nights ago  if they
used fresh horses from the posts  as is their wont  they could not reach the
city and turned back ’
‘alas ’ said théoden  ‘then denethor has heard no news of our
riding and will despair of our coming ’
‘need brooks no delay  yet late is better than never ’
said éomer  ‘and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer
than ever before since men spoke with mouth ’
it was night  on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving
silently  now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward 
far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the black sky and
the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it  they were drawing near
the rammas of the pelennor  but the day was not yet come 
the king rode in the midst of the leading company  his household-men about
him  elfhelm’s éored came
next  and now merry noticed that dernhelm had left his place and in the darkness
was moving steadily forward  until at last he was riding just in rear of the
king’s guard  there came a check  merry heard voices in front speaking softly 
out-riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall  they came
to the king 
‘there are great fires  lord ’ said one  ‘the city is all set about
with flame  and the field is full of foes  but all seem drawn off to the
assault  as well as we could guess  there are few left upon the out-wall  and
they are heedless  busy in destruction ’
‘do you remember the wild man’s words 
lord ’ said another  ‘i live upon the open wold in days of peace  wídfara
is my name  and to me also the air brings messages  already the wind is turning 
there comes a breath out of the south  there is a sea-tang in it  faint though
it be  the morning will bring new things  above the reek it will be dawn
when you pass the wall ’
‘if you speak truly  wídfara  then may you live beyond this day in
years of blessedness ’ said théoden  he turned to the men of his
household who were near  and he spoke now in a clear voice so that many
also of the riders of the first éored
heard him 
‘now is the hour come  riders of the mark  sons of eorl  foes and fire are
before you  and your homes far behind  yet  though you fight upon an alien
field  the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever  oaths ye have
taken  now fulfil them all  to lord and land and league of friendship ’
men clashed spear upon shield 
‘éomer  my son  you lead the first éored ’ said théoden 
‘and it shall go behind the king’s banner in the centre  elfhelm 
lead your company to the right when we pass the wall  and grimbold shall lead
his towards the left  let the other companies behind follow these three that
lead  as they have chance  strike wherever the enemy gathers  other plans we
cannot make  for we know not yet how things stand upon the field  forth now  and
fear no darkness ’
the leading company rode off as swiftly as they could  for it was still deep
dark  whatever change wídfara might forebode  merry was riding behind
dernhelm  clutching with the left hand while with the other he tried to
loosen his sword in its sheath  he felt now bitterly the truth of the old
king’s words  in such a battle what would you do meriadoc  just
this ’ he thought  ‘encumber a rider  and hope at best to stay in my seat
and not be pounded to death by galloping hoofs ’
it was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood  they soon
reached them  too soon for merry  wild cries broke out  and there was some clash
of arms  but it was brief  the orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed 
and they were quickly slain or driven off  before the ruin of the north-gate in
the rammas the king halted again  the first éored
drew up behind him and about him on either side  dernhelm kept close to the
king  though elfhelm’s company was away on the right  grimbold’s men turned
aside and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward 
merry peered from behind dernhelm’s back  far away  maybe ten miles or
more  there was a great burning  but between it and the riders lines of fire
blazed in a vast crescent  at the nearest point less than a league distant  he
could make out little more on the dark plain  and as yet he neither saw any hope
of morning  nor felt any wind  changed or unchanged 
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the field of gondor 
pouring in slowly but steadily  like the rising tide through breaches in a dike
that men have thought secure  but the mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city  and as yet no tidings came to him warning that
his designs held any flaw 
after a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward  to come between
the fires of the siege and the outer fields  still they were unchallenged  and
still théoden gave no signal  at last he halted once again  the
city was now nearer  a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of
death  the horses were uneasy  but the king sat upon snowmane  motionless 
gazing upon the agony of minas tirith  as if stricken suddenly by anguish  or
by dread  he seemed to shrink down  cowed by age  merry himself felt as if a
great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him  his heart beat slowly  time
seemed poised in uncertainty  they were too late  too late was worse than never 
perhaps théoden would quail  bow his old head  turn  slink away to
hide in the hills 
then suddenly merry felt it at last  beyond doubt  a change  wind was in his
face  light was glimmering  far  far away  in the south the clouds could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapes  rolling up  drifting  morning lay beyond them 
but at that same moment there was a flash  as if lightning had sprung from
the earth beneath the city  for a searing second it stood dazzling far off in
black and white  its topmost tower like a glittering needle  and then as the
darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom 
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect  tall and
proud he seemed again  and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice  more
clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before 
arise  arise  riders of théoden 

fell deeds awake  fire and slaughter 

spear shall be shaken  shield be splintered 

a sword-day  a red day  ere the sun rises 

ride now  ride now  ride to gondor 
with that he seized a great horn from guthláf
his banner-bearer  and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder  and
straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music  and the blowing
of the horns of rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a
thunder in the mountains 
ride now  ride now  ride to gondor 
suddenly the king cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away  behind him his
banner blew in the wind  white horse upon a field of green  but he outpaced it 
after him thundered the knights of his house  but
he was ever before them  éomer rode there  the white horsetail on his
helm floating in his speed  and the front of the first éored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore  but théoden could not be
overtaken  fey he seemed  or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new tire in
his veins  and he was borne up on snowmane like a god of old  even as oromë
the great in the battle of the valar when the world was young  his golden shield
was uncovered  and lo  it shone like an image of the sun  and the grass
flamed into green about the white feet of his steed  for morning came  morning
and a wind from the sea  and the darkness was removed  and the hosts of mordor
wailed  and terror took them  and they fled  and died  and the hoofs of wrath
rode over them  and then all the host of rohan burst into song  and they sang as
they slew  for the joy of battle was on them  and the sound of their singing
that was fair and terrible came even to the city 
 
but it was no orc-chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor  the
darkness was breaking too soon  before the date that his master had set for it 
fortune had betrayed him for the moment  and the world had turned against him 
victory was slipping from his grasp even as he
stretched out his hand to seize it  but his arm was long  he was still in
command  wielding great powers  king  ringwraith  lord of the nazgûl  he
had many weapons  he left the gate and vanished 
théoden king of the mark had reached the road from the gate to
the river  and he turned towards the city that was now less than a mile distant 
he slackened his speed a little  seeking new foes  and his knights came about
him  and dernhelm was with them  ahead nearer the walls elfhelm’s men were
among the siege-engines  hewing  slaying  driving their foes into the fire-pits 
well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was overrun  and there camps
were blazing  orcs were flying towards the river like herds before the hunters 
and the rohirrim went hither and thither at their will  but they had not yet
overthrown the siege  nor won the gate  many foes stood before it  and on the
further half of the plain were other hosts still unfought  southward beyond the
road lay the main force of the haradrim  and there their horsemen were gathered
about the standard of their chieftain  and he looked out  and in the growing
light he saw the banner of the king  and that it was far ahead of the battle
with few men about it  then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted aloud 
and displaying his standard  black serpent upon scarlet  he came against the
white horse and the green with great press of men  and the drawing of the
scimitars of the southrons was like a glitter of stars 
then théoden was aware of him  and would not wait for his
onset  but crying to snowmane he charged headlong to greet him  great was the
clash of their meeting  but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter 
and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter 
fewer were they but they clove through the southrons like a fire-bolt in a
forest  right through the press drove théoden thengel’s son  and his
spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain  out swept his sword  and he
spurred to the standard  hewed staff and bearer  and the black serpent
foundered  then all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far
away 
but lo  suddenly in the midst of the glory of the king his golden shield was
dimmed  the new morning was blotted from the sky  dark fell about him  horses
reared and screamed  men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground 
‘to me  to me ’ cried théoden  ‘up eorlingas  fear no
darkness ’ but snowmane wild with terror stood up on high  fighting with the
air  and then with a great scream he crashed upon his side  a black dart
had pierced him  the king fell beneath him 
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud  and behold  it was a winged
creature  if bird  then greater than all other birds  and it was naked  and
neither quill nor feather did it bear  and its vast pinions were as webs of hide
between horned fingers  and it stank  a creature of an older world maybe it was 
whose kind  fingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the moon  outstayed
their day  and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood  apt to evil  and
the dark lord took it  and nursed it with fell meats  until it grew beyond the
measure of all other things that fly  and he gave it to his servant to be his
steed  down  down it came  and then  folding its fingered webs  it gave a
croaking cry  and settled upon the body of snowmane  digging in its claws 
stooping its long naked neck 
upon it sat a shape  black-mantled  huge and threatening  a crown of steel he
bore  but between rim and robe naught was there to
see  save only a deadly gleam of eyes  the lord of the nazgûl  to the air
he had returned  summoning his steed ere the darkness failed  and now he was
come again  bringing ruin  turning hope to despair  and victory to death  a
great black mace he wielded 
but théoden was not utterly forsaken  the knights of his house lay
slain about him  or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far
away  yet one stood there still  dernhelm the young  faithful beyond fear  and
he wept  for he had loved his lord as a father  right through the charge
merry had been borne unharmed behind him  until the shadow came  and then
windfola had thrown them in his terror  and now ran wild upon the plain  merry
crawled on all fours like a dazed beast  and such a horror was on him that he
was blind and sick 
‘king’s man  king’s man ’ his heart cried within him  ‘you must
stay by him  as a father you shall be to me  you said ’ but his will made no
answer  and his body shook  he dared not open his eyes or look up 
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard dernhelm
speaking  yet now the voice seemed strange  recalling some other voice that he
had known 
‘begone  foul dwimmerlaik  lord of carrion  leave the dead in peace ’
a cold voice answered  ‘come not between the
nazgûl and his prey  or he will not slay thee in thy turn  he will bear
thee away to the houses of lamentation  beyond all darkness  where thy flesh
shall be devoured  and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye ’
a sword rang as it was drawn  ‘do what you will  but i will hinder it  if i
may ’
‘hinder me  thou fool  no living man may hinder me ’
then merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest  it seemed that
dernhelm laughed  and the clear voice was like the ring
of steel  ‘but no living man am i  you look upon a woman  éowyn i am 
éomund’s daughter  you stand between me and my lord and kin  begone  if
you be not deathless  for living or dark undead  i will smite you  if you touch
him ’
the winged creature screamed at her  but the ringwraith made no answer  and
was silent  as if in sudden doubt  very amazement for a moment conquered
merry’s fear  he opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them  there
some paces from him sat the great beast  and all seemed
dark about it  and above it loomed the nazgûl lord like a shadow of
despair  a little to the left facing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm 
but the helm of her secrecy  had fallen from her  and her bright hair  released
from its bonds  gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders  her eyes grey
as the sea were hard and fell  and yet tears were on her cheek  a sword was in
her hand  and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy’s eyes 
éowyn it was  and dernhelm also  for into merry’s mind
flashed the memory of the face that he saw at the riding from dunharrow  the
face of one that goes seeking death  having no hope  pity filled his heart and
great wonder  and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke  he
clenched his hand  she should not die  so fair  so desperate at least she should
not die alone  unaided 
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him  but still he hardly dared
to move  dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him  slowly  slowly he
began to crawl aside  but the black captain  in doubt and malice intent upon the
woman before him  heeded him no more than a worm in the mud 
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings  and the wind of them was
foul  again it leaped into the air  and then swiftly fell
down upon éowyn  shrieking  striking with beak and claw 
still she did not blench  maiden of the rohirrim  child of kings  slender but
as a steel-blade  fair but terrible  a swift stroke she dealt  skilled and
deadly  the outstretched neck she clove asunder  and the hewn head fell like a
stone  backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin  vast wings
outspread  crumpled on the earth  and with its fall the shadow passed away  a
light fell about her  and her hair shone in the sunrise 
out of the wreck rose the black rider  tall and threatening  towering above
her  with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let fall his
mace  her shield was shivered in many pieces  and her arm was broken  she
stumbled to her knees  he bent over her like a cloud  and his eyes glittered  he
raised his mace to kill 
but suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain  and his
stroke went wide  driving into the ground  merry’s sword had stabbed him from
behind  shearing through the black mantle  and passing up beneath the hauberk
had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee 
‘éowyn  éowyn ’ cried merry  then tottering  struggling up 
with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle  as the
great shoulders bowed before her  the sword broke sparkling into many shards 
the crown rolled away with a clang  éowyn fell forward upon her fallen
foe  but lo  the mantle and hauberk were empty  shapeless they lay now on the
ground  torn and tumbled  and a cry went up into the shuddering air  and
faded to a shrill wailing  passing with the wind  a voice bodiless and thin that
died  and was swallowed up  and was never heard again in that age of this world 
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain  blinking like
an owl in the daylight  for tears blinded him  and
through a mist he looked on éowyn’s fair head  as she lay and did not
move  and he looked on the face of the king  fallen in the midst of his glory 
for snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again  yet he was the
bane of his master 
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it  and lo  théoden
opened his eyes  and they were clear  and he spoke in a quiet voice though
laboured 
‘farewell  master holbytla ’ he said  ‘my body is broken  i go to my
fathers  and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed  i felled
the black serpent  a grim morn  and a glad day  and a golden sunset ’
merry could not speak  but wept anew  ‘forgive me  lord ’ he said at
last  ‘if i broke your command  and yet have done no more in your service than
to weep at our parting ’
the old king smiled  ‘grieve not  it is forgiven  great heart will not be
denied  live now in blessedness  and when you sit in peace with your pipe  think
of me  for never now shall i sit with you in
meduseld  as i promised  or listen to your herb-lore ’ he closed his eyes  and
merry bowed beside him  presently he spoke again  ‘where is éomer  for
my eyes darken  and i would see him ere i go  he must be king after me  and i
would send word to éowyn  she  she would not have me leave her 
and now i shall not see her again  dearer than daughter ’
‘lord  lord ’ began merry brokenly  ‘she is-‘  but at that moment
there was a great clamour  and all about them horns and trumpets were blowing 
merry looked round  he had forgotten the war  and all the world beside  and many
hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall  though in truth it was only a
little while  but now he saw that they were in danger of being caught in the
very midst of the great battle that would soon be joined 
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the river  and from
under the walls came the legions of morgul  and from the southward fields came
footmen of harad with horsemen before them  and behind them rose the huge backs
of the mûmakil
with war-towers upon them  but northward the white crest of éomer led the
great front of the rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshalled  and out
of the city came all the strength of men that was in it  and the silver swan of
dol amroth was borne in the van  driving the enemy from the gate 
for a moment the thought flitted through merry’s mind  ‘where is gandalf 
is he not here  could he not have saved the king and éowyn ’ but
thereupon éomer rode up in haste  and with him came the knights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses  they looked in
wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there  and their steeds would
not go near  but éomer leaped from the saddle  and grief and dismay fell
upon him as he came to the king’s side and stood there in silence 
then one of the knights took the king’s banner from the hand of guthláf
the banner-bearer who lay dead  and he lifted it up  slowly théoden
opened his eyes  seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to
éomer 
‘hail  king of the mark ’ he said  ‘ride now to victory  bid éowyn
farewell ’ and so he died  and knew not that éowyn lay near him  and
those who stood by wept  crying  ‘théoden king  théoden king ’
but éomer said to them 
mourn not overmuch  mighty was the fallen 

meet was his ending  when his mound is raised 

women then shall weep  war now calls us 
yet he himself wept as he spoke  ‘let his knights remain here ’ he said 
‘and bear his body in honour from the field  lest the battle ride
over it  yea  and all these other of the king’s men that lie here ’ and he
looked at the slain  recalling their names  then suddenly he beheld his sister
éowyn as she lay  and he knew her  he stood a moment as a man who is
pierced in the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart  and then his
face went deathly white  and a cold fury rose in him  so that all speech failed
him for a while  a fey mood took him 
‘éowyn  éowyn ’ he cried at last  ‘éowyn  how come
you here  what madness or devilry is this  death  death  death  death
take us all ’
then without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the
city  he spurred headlong back to the front of the great host  and blew a horn 
and cried aloud for the onset  over the field rang his clear voice calling 
‘death  ride  ride to ruin and the world’s ending ’
and with that the host began to move  but the rohirrim sang no more  death
they cried with one voice loud and terrible  and gathering speed like a great
tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed  roaring away
southwards 
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears and no
one spoke to him  indeed none seemed to heed him  he brushed away the tears  and
stooped to pick up the green shield that éowyn had given him  and
he slung it at his back  then he looked for his sword that he had let fall  for
even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed  and now he could only use his
left hand  and behold  there lay his weapon  but the blade was smoking like a
dry branch that has been thrust in a fire  and as he watched it  it writhed and
withered and was consumed 
so passed the sword of the barrow-downs  work of westernesse  but glad would
he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the north-kingdom
when the dúnedain were young  and chief among their foes was the dread
realm of angmar and its sorcerer king  no other blade  not though mightier hands
had wielded it  would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter  cleaving the undead
flesh  breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will 
men now raised the king  and laying cloaks upon spear-truncheons they made
shift to bear him away towards the city  and others lifted éowyn gently
up and bore her after him  but the men of the king’s household they could not
yet bring from the field  for seven of the king’s knights had fallen there 
and déorwine their chief was among them  so they laid them apart from
their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them  and afterwards when all
was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of the
beast  but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which was
carved in the tongues of gondor and the mark 
faithful servant yet master’s bane

lightfoot’s foal  swift snowmane 
green and long grew the grass on snowmane’s howe  but ever black and bare
was the ground where the beast was burned 
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers  and he gave no more
heed to the battle  he was weary and full of pain  and his limbs trembled
as with a chill  a great rain came out of the sea  and it seemed that all things
wept for théoden and éowyn  quenching the fires in the city with
grey tears  it was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of
gondor approaching  imrahil  prince of dol amroth  rode up and drew rein
before them 
‘what burden do you bear  men of rohan ’ he cried 
‘théoden king ’ they answered  ‘he is dead  but éomer
king now rides in the battle  he with the white crest in the wind ’
then the prince went from his horse  and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his great onset  and he wept  and rising
he looked then on éowyn and was amazed  ‘surely  here is a woman ’ he
said  ‘have even the women of the rohirrim come to war in our need ’
‘nay  one only ’ they answered  ‘the lady
éowyn is she  sister of éomer  and we knew naught of her riding
until this hour  and greatly we rue it ’
then the prince seeing her beauty  though her face was pale and cold  touched
her hand as he bent to look more closely on her  ‘men of rohan ’ he cried 
‘are there no leeches among you  she is hurt to the death maybe  but i deem
that she yet lives ’ and he held the bright-burnished vambrace that was upon
his arm before her cold tips  and behold  a little mist was laid on it hardly to
be seen 
‘haste now is needed ’ he said  and he sent one riding back swiftly to
the city to bring aid  but he bowing low to the fallen  bade them farewell  and
mounting rode away into battle 
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of the pelennor  and the din
of arms rose upon high  with the crying of men and the neighing of horses  horns
were blown and trumpets were braying  and the mûmakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to war  under the south walls of the city the
footmen of gondor now drove against the legions of
morgul that were still gathered there in strength  but the horsemen rode
eastward to the succour of éomer  húrin the tall warden of the
keys  and the lord of lossarnach  and hirluin of the green hills  and prince
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him 
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim  for fortune had turned against
éomer  and his fury had betrayed him  the great wrath of his onset had
utterly overthrown the front of his enemies  and great wedges of his riders
had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons  discomfiting their horsemen
and riding their footmen to ruin  but wherever the mûmakil
came there the horses would not go  but blenched and swerved away  and the great
monsters were unfought  and stood like towers of defence  and the haradrim
rallied about them  and if the rohirrim at their onset were thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alone  soon their case became worse  for new strength came now
streaming to the field out of osgiliath  there they had been mustered for the
sack of the city and the rape of gondor  waiting on the call of their captain 
he now was destroyed  but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul had flung them into
the fray  easterlings with axes  and variags of khand  southrons in scarlet  and
out of far harad black men like half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues 
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim  others held westward to hold off the
forces of gondor and prevent their joining with rohan 
it was even as the day thus began to turn against gondor and their hope
wavered that a new cry went up in the city  it being then midmorning  and a
great wind blowing  and the rain flying north  and the sun shining  in that
clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear  and their last
hope left them 
for anduin  from the bend at the harlond  so flowed that from the city men
could look down it lengthwise for some leagues  and the far-sighted could see
any ships that approached  and looking thither they cried in dismay  for black
against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on the wind 
dromunds  and ships of great draught with many oars  and with black sails
bellying in the breeze 
‘the corsairs of umbar ’ men shouted  ‘the corsairs of umbar  look  the
corsairs of umbar are coming  so belfalas is taken  and the ethir  and lebennin
is gone  the corsairs are upon us  it is the last stroke of doom ’
and some without order  for none could he found to command them in the city 
ran to the bells and tolled the alarm  and some blew the trumpets sounding the
retreat  ‘back to the walls ’ they cried  ‘back to the walls  come back to
the city before all are overwhelmed ’ but the wind that sped the ships blew
all their clamour away 
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm 
all too well they could see for themselves the black sails  for éomer was
now scarcely a mile from the harlond  and a great press of his first foes was
between him and the haven there  while new foes came swirling behind  cutting
him off from the prince  now he looked to the river  and hope died in his
heart  and the wind that he had blessed he now called accursed  but the hosts of
mordor were enheartened  and filled with a new lust and fury they came yelling
to the onset 
stern now was éomer’s mood  and his mind clear again  he let
blow the horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither  for he
thought to make a great shield-wall at the last  and stand  and fight there on
foot till all fell  and do deeds of song on the fields of pelennor  though no
man should be left in the west to remember the last king of the mark  so he rode
to a green hillock and there set his banner  and the white horse ran rippling in
the wind 
out of doubt  out of dark to the day’s rising

i came singing in the sun  sword unsheathing 

to hope’s end i rode and to heart’s breaking 

now for wrath  now for ruin and a red nightfall 
these staves he spoke  yet he laughed as he said them  for once more lust of
battle was on him  and he was still unscathed  and he was young  and he was
king  the lord of a fell people  and lo  even as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on the black ships  and he lifted up his sword to defy them 
and then wonder took him  and a great joy  and he cast his sword up in the
sunlight and sang as he caught it  and all eyes followed his gaze  and behold 
upon the foremost ship a great standard broke  and the wind displayed it as she
turned towards the harlond  there flowered a white tree  and that was for
gondor  but seven stars were about it  and a high crown above it  the signs of
elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count  and the stars flamed in
the sunlight  for they were wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond  and the
crown was bright in the morning  for it was wrought of mithril and gold 
thus came aragorn son of arathorn  elessar  isildur’s heir  out of the
paths of the dead  borne upon a wind from the sea to the kingdom of gondor  and
the mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords 
and the joy and wonder of the city was a music of trumpets and a ringing of
bells  but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewilderment  and a great
wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled with their
foes  and a black dread fell on them  knowing that the tides of fate had turned
against them and their doom was at hand 
east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy before them  troll-men
and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight  south strode éomer and men
fled before his face  and they were caught between the hammer and the
anvil  for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the harlond and swept
north like a storm  there came legolas  and gimli wielding his axe  and halbarad
with the standard  and elladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow  and the dour-handed dúnedain  rangers of the north  leading a
great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and the fiefs of the south  but
before all went aragorn with the flame of the west  andúril like a new
fire kindled  narsil re-forged as deadly as of old  and upon his brow was
the star of elendil 
and so at length éomer and aragorn met in the midst of the battle  and
they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad 
‘thus we meet again  though all the hosts of mordor lay between us ’ said
aragorn  ‘did i not say so at the hornburg ’
‘so you spoke ’ said éomer  ‘but hope oft deceives  and i knew
not then that you were a man foresighted  yet twice blessed is help unlooked
for  and never was a meeting of friends more joyful ’ and they clasped hand in
hand  ‘nor indeed more timely ’ said éomer  ‘you come none too
soon  my friend  much loss and sorrow has befallen us ’
‘then let us avenge it  ere we speak of it ’ said aragorn  and they rode
back to battle together 
hard fighting and long labour they had still  for the southrons were bold men
and grim  and fierce in despair  and the easterlings were strong and
war-hardened and asked for no quarter  and so in this place and that  by burned
homestead or barn  upon hillock or mound  under wall or on field  still they
gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away 
then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled all the sky with a
great burning  so that the hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood  fire
glowed in the river  and the grass of the pelennor lay red in the nightfall  and
in that hour the great battle of the field of gondor was over  and not one
living foe was left within the circuit of the rammas  all were slain save those
who fled to die  or to drown in the red foam of the river  few ever came
eastward to morgul or mordor  and to the land of the haradrim came only a tale
from far off  a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor 
aragorn and éomer and imrahil rode back towards the gate of the city 
and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow  these three were unscathed  for
such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms  and few indeed had
dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath  but many
others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field  the axes hewed forlong as he
fought alone and unhorsed  and both duilin of morthond and his brother were
trampled to death when they assailed the mûmakil 
leading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters  neither hirluin
the fair would return to pinnath gelin  nor grimbold to grimslade  nor halbarad
to the northlands  dour-handed ranger  no few had fallen  renowned or nameless 
captain or soldier  for it was a great battle and the full count of it no tale
has told  so long afterward a maker in rohan said in his song of the mounds of
mundburg 
we heard of the horns in the hills ringing 

the swords shining in the south-kingdom 

steeds went striding to the stoningland

as wind in the morning  war was kindled 

there théoden fell  thengling mighty 

to his golden halls and green pastures

in the northern fields never returning 

high lord of the host  harding and guthláf

dúnhere and déorwine  doughty grimbold 

herefara and herubrand  horn and fastred 

fought and fell there in a far country 

in the mounds of mundburg under mould they lie

with their league-fellows  lords of gondor 

neither hirluin the fair to the hills by the sea 

nor forlong the old to the flowering vales

ever  to arnach  to his own country

returned in triumph  nor the tall bowmen 

derufin and duilin  to their dark waters 

meres of morthond under mountain-shadows 

death in the morning and at day’s ending

lords took and lowly  long now they sleep

under grass in gondor by the great river 

grey now as tears  gleaming silver 

red then it rolled  roaring water 

foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset 

as beacons mountains burned at evening 

red fell the dew in rammas echor 
 
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless  but
pippin rose to his feet  as if a great weight had been lifted from him  and he
stood listening to the horns  and it seemed to him that they would break his
heart with joy  and never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the
distance without tears starting in his eyes  but now suddenly his errand
returned to his memory  and he ran forward  at that moment gandalf stirred and
spoke to shadowfax  and was about to ride through the gate 
‘gandalf  gandalf  ‘ cried pippin  and shadowfax halted 
‘what are you doing here ’ said gandalf  ‘is it not a law in the city
that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the citadel  unless their
lord gives them leave ’
‘he has ’ said pippin  ‘he sent me away  but i am frightened  something
terrible may happen up there  the lord is out of his mind  i think  i am afraid
he will kill himself  and kill faramir too  can’t you do something ’
gandalf looked through the gaping gate  and already on the fields he heard
the gathering sound of battle  he clenched his hand  ‘i must go ‘ he said 
‘the black rider is abroad  and he will yet bring ruin on us  i have no
time ’
‘but faramir ’ cried pippin  ‘he is not dead  and they will burn him
alive  if someone does not stop them ’
‘burn him alive ’ said gandalf  ‘what is this tale  be quick ’
‘denethor has gone to the tombs ’ said pippin  ‘and he has taken
faramir  and he says we are all to burn  and he will not wait  and they are to
make a pyre and burn him on it  and faramir as well  and he has sent men to
fetch wood and oil  and i have told beregond  but i’m afraid he won’t dare
to leave his post  he is on guard  and what can he do anyway ’ so pippin
poured out his tale  reaching up and touching gandalf’s knee with trembling
hands  ‘can’t you save faramir ’
‘maybe i can ’ said gandalf  ‘but if i do  then others will die  i
fear  well  i must come  since no other help can reach him  but evil and sorrow
will come of this  even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to
strike us  for his will it is that is at work ’
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly  and catching up pippin and
setting him before him  he turned shadowfax with a word  up the climbing streets
of minas tirith they clattered  while the noise of war rose behind them 
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread  seizing their weapons 
crying one to another  ‘rohan has come ’ captains were shouting  companies
were mustering  many already were marching down to the gate 
they met the prince imrahil  and he called to them  ‘whither now 
mithrandir  the rohirrim are fighting on the fields of gondor  we must gather
all the strength that we can find ’
‘you will need every man and more ’ said gandalf  ‘make all haste  i
will come when i can  but i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not
wait  take command in the lord’s absence ’
they passed on  and as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they felt
the wind blowing in their faces  and they caught the glimmer of morning far
away  a light growing in the southern sky  but it brought little hope to them 
not knowing what evil lay before them  fearing to come too late 
‘darkness is passing ’ said gandalf  ‘but it still lies heavy on this
city ’
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard  ‘then beregond has gone ’
said pippin more hopefully  they turned away and hastened along the road to the
closed door  it stood wide open  and the porter lay before it  he was slain and
his key had been taken 
‘work of the enemy ’ said gandalf  ‘such deeds he loves  friend at war
with friend  loyalty divided in confusion of hearts ’ now he dismounted and
bade shadowfax return to his stable  ‘for  my friend ’ he said  ‘you and i
should have ridden to the fields long ago  but other matters delay me  yet come
swiftly if i call ’
they passed the door and walked on down the steep winding road  light was
growing  and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went slowly by
like grey ghosts 
suddenly the silence was broken  and they heard below them cries and the
ringing of swords  such sounds as had not been
heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city  at last they came
to rath dínen and hastened towards the house of the stewards  looming in
the twilight under its great dome 
‘stay  stay ’ cried gandalf  springing forward to the stone stair before
the door  ‘stay this madness ’
for there were the servants of denethor with swords and torches in their
hands  but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond  clad in the
black and silver of the guard  and he held the door against them  two of them
had already fallen to his sword  staining the hallows with their blood  and the
others cursed him  calling him outlaw and traitor to his master 
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward  they heard from within the house of
the dead the voice of denethor crying  ‘haste  haste  do as i have bidden 
slay me this renegade  or must i do so myself ’ thereupon the door which
beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open  and there behind him
stood the lord of the city  tall and fell  a light like flame was in his eyes 
and he held a drawn sword 
but gandalf sprang up the steps  and the men fell back from him and covered
their eyes  for his coming was like the incoming of a white light into a dark
place  and he came with great anger  he lifted up his hand  and in the very
stroke  the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp and fell behind him in
the shadows of the house  and denethor stepped backward before gandalf as one
amazed 
‘what is this  my lord ’ said the wizard 
‘the houses of the dead are no places for the living  and why do men fight
here in the hallows when there is war enough before the gate  or has our enemy
come even to rath dínen ’
‘since when has the lord of gondor been answerable to thee ’ said
denethor  ‘or may i not command my own servants ’
‘you may ’ said gandalf  ‘but others may contest your will  when it is
turned to madness and evil  where is your son  faramir ’
‘he lies within ’ said denethor  ‘burning  already burning  they have
set a fire in his flesh  but soon all shall be burned  the west has failed  it
shall all go up in a great fire  and all shall be ended  ash  ash and smoke
blown away on the wind ’
then gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already
done some evil deed  and he thrust forward  with beregond and pippin behind him 
while denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within  but there they
found faramir  still dreaming in his fever  lying upon the table  wood was piled
under it  and high all about it  and all was drenched with oil  even the
garments of faramir and the coverlets  but as yet no fire had been set to the
fuel  then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him  even as the light
of his power was hidden under his grey mantle  he leaped up on to the faggots 
and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again  and bore him towards the
door  but as he did so faramir moaned and called on his father in his dream 
denethor started as one waking from a trance  and the flame died in his eyes 
and he wept  and he said  ‘do not take my son from me  he calls for me ’
‘he calls ’ said gandalf  ‘but you cannot come to him yet  for he must
seek healing on the threshold of death  and maybe find it not  whereas your part
is to go out to the battle of your city  where maybe death awaits you  this you
know in your heart ’
‘he will not wake again ’ said denethor  ‘battle is vain  why should we
wish to live longer  why should we not go to death side by side ’
‘authority is not given to you  steward of gondor  to order the hour of
your death ’ answered gandalf  ‘and only the heathen kings  under the
domination of the dark power  did thus  slaying themselves in pride and despair 
murdering their kin to ease their own death ’ then passing through the door he
took faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on which he had been
brought  and which had now been set in the porch  denethor followed him  and
stood trembling  looking with longing on the face of his son  and for a moment 
while all were silent and still  watching the lord in his throes  he wavered 
‘come ’ said gandalf  ‘we are needed  there is much that you can yet
do ’
then suddenly denethor laughed  he stood up tall and proud again  and
stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his
head had lain  then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering  and lo  he
had between his hands a palantír 
and as he held it up  it seemed to those that looked on that the globe began to
glow with an inner flame  so that the lean face of the lord was lit as with a
red fire  and it seemed cut out of hard stone  sharp with black shadows  noble 
proud  and terrible  his eyes glittered 
‘pride and despair ’ he cried  ‘didst thou think that the eyes of the
white tower were blind  nay  i have seen more than thou knowest  grey fool  for
thy hope is but ignorance  go then and labour in healing  go forth and fight 
vanity  for a little space you may triumph on the field  for a day  but against
the power that now arises there is no victory  to this city only the first
finger of its hand has yet been stretched  all the east is moving  and even now
the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up anduin a fleet with black sails 
the west has failed  it is time for all to depart who would not be slaves ’
‘such counsels will make the enemy’s victory certain indeed ’ said
gandalf 
‘hope on then ’ laughed denethor  ‘do i not know thee  mithrandir  thy
hope is to rule in my stead  to stand behind every throne  north  south  or
west  i have read thy mind and its policies  do i not know that you commanded
this halfling here to keep silence  that you brought him hither to be a spy
within my very chamber  and yet in our speech together i have learned the names
and purpose of all thy companions  so  with the left hand thou wouldst use me
for a little while as a shield against mordor  and with the right bring up this
ranger of the north to supplant me 
‘but i say to thee  gandalf mithrandir  i will not be thy tool  i am
steward of the house of anárion  i will not step down to be the
dotard chamberlain of an upstart  even were his claim proved to me  still he
comes but of the line of isildur  i will not bow to such a one  last of a ragged
house long bereft of lordship and dignity ’
‘what then would you have ’ said gandalf  ‘if your will could have its
way ’
‘i would have things as they were in all the days of my life ’ answered
denethor  ‘and in the days of my longfathers before me  to be the lord of this
city in peace  and leave my chair to a son after me  who would be his own master
and no wizard’s pupil  but if doom denies this to me  then i will have naught 
neither life diminished  nor love halved  nor honour abated ’
‘to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully surrenders his
charge is diminished in love or in honour ’ said gandalf  ‘and at the least
you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt ’
at those words denethor’s eyes flamed again  and taking the stone under his
arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier  but beregond sprang forward and
set himself before faramir 
‘so ’ cried denethor  ‘thou hadst already stolen half my son’s love 
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also  so that they rob me wholly of
my son at the last  but in this at least thou shalt not defy my will  to rule my
own end ’
‘come hither ’ he cried to his servants  ‘come  if you are not all
recreant ’ then two of them ran up the steps to him  swiftly he snatched a
torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house  before gandalf could
hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel  and at once it crackled and roared
into flame 
then denethor leaped upon the table  and standing there wreathed in fire and
smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it
on his knee  casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on the
table  clasping the palantír
with both hands upon his breast  and it was said that ever after  if any man
looked in that stone  unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other
purpose  he saw only two aged hands withering in flame 
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door  for a
while he stood in thought  silent upon the threshold  while those outside heard
the greedy roaring of the fire within  and then denethor gave a great cry  and
afterwards spoke no more  nor was ever again seen by mortal men 
‘so passes denethor  son of ecthelion ’ said gandalf  then he turned to
beregond and the lord’s servants that stood there aghast  ‘and so pass also
the days of gondor that you have known  for good or evil they are ended  ill
deeds have been done here  but let now all enmity that lies between you be put
away  for it was contrived by the enemy and works his will  you have been caught
in a net of warring duties that you did not weave  but think  you servants of
the lord  blind in your obedience  that but for the treason of beregond faramir 
captain of the white tower  would now also be burned 
‘bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen  and we
will bear faramir  steward of gondor  to a place where he can sleep in peace  or
die if that be his doom ’
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the houses
of healing  while behind them walked pippin with downcast
head  but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of
the dead  and even as gandalf came to the end of rath dínen there was a
great noise  looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue
forth  and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of
fire  but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins  then
in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf 
at length they came back to the steward’s door  and beregond looked with
grief at the porter  ‘this deed i shall ever rue ’ he said  ‘but a madness
of haste was on me  and he would not listen  but drew sword against me ’ then
taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed the door and
locked it  ‘this should now be given to the lord faramir ’ he said 
‘the prince of dol amroth is in command in the absence of the lord ’ said
gandalf  ‘but since he is not here  i must take this on myself  i bid you keep
the key and guard it  until the city is set in order again ’
now at last they passed into the high circles of the city  and in the light
of morning they went their way towards the houses of healing  and these were
fair houses set apart  for the care of those who were grievously sick  but now
they were prepared for the tending of men hurt in battle or dying  they stood
not far from the citadel-gate  in the sixth circle  nigh to its southward wall 
and about them was a garden and a greensward with trees  the only such place in
the city  there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to remain in minas
tirith  since they were skilled in healing or in the service of the healers 
but even as gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier to the main
door of the houses  they heard a great cry that went up from the field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed  and died away on
the wind  so terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still  and yet
when it had passed  suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the east  and it seemed to them
that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds 
but gandalf’s face was grave and sad  and bidding beregond and pippin to
take faramir into the houses of healing  he went up
on to the walls nearby  and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out  and he beheld with the sight that was given to him all
that had befallen  and when éomer rode out from the forefront of his
battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field  he sighed  and he
cast his cloak about him again  and went from the walls  and beregond and pippin
found him standing in thought before the door of the houses when they came out 
they looked at him  and for a while he was silent  at last he spoke  ‘my
friends ’ he said  ‘and all you people of this city and of the western
lands  things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass  shall we weep or be
glad  beyond hope the captain of our foes has been destroyed  and you have heard
the echo of his last despair  but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss 
and that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor  so long has the
reach of our enemy become  alas  but now i perceive how his will was able to
enter into the very heart of the city 
‘though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves 
long ago i guessed that here in the white tower  one at least of the seven
seeing stones was preserved  in the days of his wisdom denethor did not presume
to use it  nor to challenge sauron  knowing the limits of his own strength  but
his wisdom failed  and i fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in
the stone and was deceived  far too often  i guess  since boromir departed  he
was too great to be subdued to the will of the dark power  he saw nonetheless
only those things which that power permitted him to see  the knowledge which he
obtained was  doubtless  often of service to him  yet the vision of the great
might of mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it
overthrew his mind ’
‘now i understand what seemed so strange to me ’ said pippin shuddering
at his memories as he spoke  ‘the lord went away from the room where faramir
lay  and it was only when he returned that i first thought he was changed  old
and broken ’
‘it was in the very hour that faramir was brought to the tower that many of
us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber ’ said beregond  ‘but we have
seen that light before  and it has long been rumoured in the city  that the lord
would at times wrestle in thought with his enemy ’
‘alas  then i have guessed rightly ’ said gandalf  ‘thus the will of
sauron entered into minas tirith  and thus i have been delayed here  and here i
shall still be forced to remain  for i shall soon have other charges  not
faramir only 
‘now i must go down to meet those who come  i have seen a sight upon the
field that is very grievous to my heart  and greater sorrow may yet come to
pass  come with me  pippin  but you  beregond  should return to the citadel and
tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen  it will be his duty  i
fear  to withdraw you from the guard  but say to him that  if i may give him
counsel  you should be sent to the houses of healing  to be the guard and
servant of your captain  and to be at his side when he awakes - if that shall
ever be again  for by you he was saved from the fire  go now  i shall return
soon ’
with that he turned away and went with pippin down towards the lower city 
and even as they hastened on their way the wind brought a grey rain  and all the
fires sank  and there arose a great smoke before them 
 
a mist was in merry’s eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near the
ruined gate of minas tirith  he gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that
lay about all  fire and smoke and stench was in the air  for many engines had
been burned or cast into the fire-pits  and many of the slain also  while here
and there lay many carcases of the great southron monsters  half-burned  or
broken by stone-cast  or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of
morthond  the flying rain had ceased for a time  and the sun gleamed up above 
but all the lower city was still wrapped in a smouldering reek 
already men were labouring to clear a way
through the jetsam of battle  and now out from the gate came some bearing
litters  gently they laid éowyn upon soft pillows  but the king’s body
they covered with a great cloth of gold  and they bore torches about him  and
their flames  pale in the sunlight  were fluttered by the wind 
so théoden and éowyn came to the city of gondor  and all who
saw them bared their heads and bowed  and they passed through the ash and fume
of the burned circle  and went on and up along the streets of stone  to
merry the ascent seemed agelong  a meaningless journey in a hateful dream  going
on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize 
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out  and
he was walking in a darkness  and he thought  ‘this is a tunnel leading to a
tomb  there we shall stay forever ’ but suddenly into his dream there fell a
living voice 
‘well  merry  thank goodness i have found you ’
he looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little  there was pippin 
they were face to face in a narrow lane  and but for themselves it was empty  he
rubbed his eyes 
‘where is the king ’ he said  ‘and éowyn ’ then he stumbled
and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again 
‘they have gone up into the citadel ’ said pippin  ‘i think you must
have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning  when we found that
you were not with them  gandalf sent me to look for you  poor old merry  how
glad i am to see you again  but you are worn out  and i won’t bother you with
any talk  but tell me  are you hurt  or wounded ’
‘no ’ said merry  ‘well  no  i don’t think so  but i can’t use my
right arm  pippin  not since i stabbed him  and my sword burned all away like a
piece of wood ’
pippin’s face was anxious  ‘well  you had better come with me as quick as
you can ’ he said  ‘i wish i could carry you  you aren’t fit to walk any
further  they shouldn’t have let you walk at all  but you must forgive them 
so many dreadful things have happened in the city  merry  that one poor hobbit
coming in from the battle is easily overlooked ’
‘it’s not always a misfortune being overlooked ’ said merry  ‘i was
overlooked just now by - no  no  i can’t speak of it  help me  pippin  it’s
all going dark again  and my arm is so cold ’
‘lean on me  merry lad ’ said pippin  ‘come now  foot by foot  it’s
not far ’
‘are you going to bury me ’ said merry 
‘no  indeed ’ said pippin  trying to sound cheerful  though his heart was
wrung with fear and pity  ‘no  we are going to the houses of healing ’
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall
of the fourth circle  and they regained the main street climbing up to the
citadel  step by step they went  while merry swayed and murmured as one in
sleep 
‘i’ll never get him there ’ thought pippin  ‘is there no one to help
me  i can’t leave him here ’ just then to his surprise a boy came running up
behind  and as he passed he recognized bergil beregond’s son 
‘hullo  bergil ’ he called  ‘where are you going  glad to see you
again  and still alive ’
‘i am running errands for the healers ’ said bergil  ‘i cannot stay ’
‘don’t ’ said pippin  ‘but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit  a perian mind you  come from the battle-field  i don’t think he
can walk so far  if mithrandir is there  he will be glad of the message ’
bergil ran on 
‘i’d better wait here ’ thought pippin  so he let merry sink gently
down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight  and then he sat down beside him 
laying merry’s head in his lap  he felt his body and limbs gently  and took
his friend’s hands in his own  the right hand felt icy to the touch 
it was not long before gandalf himself came in search of them  he stooped
over merry and caressed his brow  then he lifted him carefully  ‘he should
have been borne in honour into this city ’ he said  ‘he has well repaid my
trust  for if elrond had not yielded to me  neither of you would have set out 
and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have been ’ he sighed 
‘and yet here is another charge on my hands  while all the time the battle
hangs in the balance ’
so at last faramir and éowyn and meriadoc were laid in beds in the
houses of healing  and there they were tended well  for though all lore was in
these latter days fallen from its fullness of old  the leechcraft of
gondor was still wise  and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt  and all
such sickness as east of the sea mortal men were subject to  save old age only 
for that they had found no cure  and indeed the span of their lives had now
waned to little more than that of other men  and those among them who passed the
tale of five score years with vigour were grown few  save in some houses of
purer blood  but now their art and knowledge were baffled  for there were many
sick of a malady that would not be healed  and they
called it the black shadow  for it came from the nazgûl  and those who
were stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream  and then passed to
silence and a deadly cold  and so died  and it seemed to the tenders of the sick
that on the halfling and on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily  still at
whiles as the morning wore away they would speak  murmuring in their dreams  and
the watchers listened to all that they said  hoping perhaps to learn something
that would help them to understand their hurts  but soon they began to fall down
into the darkness  and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their
faces  but faramir burned with a fever that would not abate 
gandalf went from one to the other full of care  and he was told all that the
watchers could hear  and so the day passed  while the great battle outside went
on with shifting hopes and strange tidings  and still gandalf waited and watched
and did not go forth  till at last the red sunset filled all the sky  and the
light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick  then it seemed to
those who stood by that in the glow the faces flushed softly as with health
returning  but it was only a mockery of hope 
then an old wife  ioreth  the eldest of the women who served in that house 
looking on the fair face of faramir  wept  for all the people loved him  and she
said  ‘alas  if he should die  would that there were kings in gondor  as there
were once upon a time  they say  for it is said in old lore  the hands of the
king are the hands of a healer  and so the rightful king could ever be
known ’
and gandalf  who stood by  said  ‘men may long remember your words  ioreth 
for there is hope in them  maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor  or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the city ’
‘i have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and
shouting ’ she answered  ‘all i hope is that those murdering devils do not
come to this house and trouble the sick ’
then gandalf went out in haste  and already the fire in the sky was burning
out  and the smouldering hills were fading  while ash-grey evening crept over
the fields 
now as the sun went down aragorn and éomer and imrahil drew near the
city with their captains and knights  and when they came before the gate
aragorn said 
‘behold the sun setting in a great fire  it is a sign of the end and fall
of many things  and a change in the tides of the world  but this city and realm
has rested in the charge of the stewards for many long years  and i fear that if
i enter it unbidden  then doubt and debate may arise  which should not be while
this war is fought  i will not enter in  nor make any claim  until it be seen
whether we or mordor shall prevail  men shall pitch my tents upon the field  and
here i will await the welcome of the lord of the city ’
but éomer said  ‘already you have raised the banner of the kings and
displayed the tokens of elendil’s house  will you suffer these to be
challenged ’
‘no ’ said aragorn  ‘but i deem the time unripe  and i have no mind for
strife except with our enemy and his servants ’
and the prince imrahil said  your words  lord  are wise  if one who is a
kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in this matter  he is strong-willed
and proud  but old  and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken
down  yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door ’
‘not a beggar ’ said aragorn  ‘say a captain of the rangers  who are
unused to cities and houses of stone ’ and he commanded that his banner should
be furled  and he did off the star of the north kingdom and gave it to the
keeping of the sons of elrond 
then the prince imrahil and éomer of rohan left him and passed through
the city and the tumult of the people  and mounted to the citadel  and they came
to the hall of the tower  seeking the steward  but they found his chair empty 
and before the dais lay théoden king of the mark upon a bed of state  and
twelve torches stood about it  and twelve guards  knights both of rohan and
gondor  and the hangings of the bed were of green and white  but upon the
king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast  and upon that his
unsheathed sword  and at his feet his shield  the light of the torches shimmered
in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain  but his face was fair and
young  save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of youth  and it seemed that
he slept 
when they had stood silent for a time beside the king  imrahil said  ‘where
is the steward  and where also is mithrandir ’
and one of the guards answered  ‘the steward of gondor is in the houses of
healing ’
but éomer said  ‘where is the lady éowyn  my sister  for
surely she should be lying beside the king  and in no less honour  where have
they bestowed her ’
and imrahil said  ‘but the lady éowyn
was yet living when they bore her hither  did you not know ’
then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to éomer’s heart  and with
it the bite of care and fear renewed  that he said no more  but turned and went
swiftly from the hall  and the prince followed him  and when they came
forth evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky  and there came gandalf
on foot and with him one cloaked in grey  and they met before the doors of the
houses of healing  and they greeted gandalf and said 
‘we seek the steward  and men say that he is in this house  has any hurt
befallen him  and the lady éowyn  where is she ’
and gandalf answered  ‘she lies within and is not dead  but is near death 
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart  as you have heard  and he is
now the steward  for denethor has departed  and his house is in ashes ’ and
they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told 
but imrahil said  ‘so victory is shorn of gladness  and it is bitter
bought  if both gondor and rohan are in one day
bereft of their lords  éomer rules the rohirrim  who shall rule the city
meanwhile  shall we not send now for the lord aragorn ’
and the cloaked man spoke and said  ‘he is come ’ and they saw as he
stepped into the light of the lantern by the door
that it was aragorn  wrapped in the grey cloak of lórien above his mail 
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel  ‘i have come
because gandalf begs me to do so ’ he said  ‘but for the present i am but
the captain of the dúnedain of arnor  and the lord of dol amroth shall
rule the city until faramir awakes  but it is my counsel that gandalf should
rule us all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy ’ and
they agreed upon that 
then gandalf said  ‘let us not stay at the door  for the time is urgent 
let us enter  for it is only in the coming of aragorn that any hope remains for
the sick that lie in the house  thus spake ioreth  wise-woman of gondor  the
hands of the king are the hands of a healer  and so shall the rightful king be
known ’
then aragorn entered first and the others followed  and there at the door
were two guards in the livery of the citadel  one tall  but the other scarce the
height of a boy  and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise and joy 
‘strider  how splendid  do you know  i guessed it was you in the black
ships  but they were all shouting corsairs and wouldn’t listen to me 
how did you do it ’
aragorn laughed  and took the hobbit by the hand  ‘well met indeed ’ he
said  ‘but there is not time yet for travellers’ tales ’
but imrahil said to éomer  ‘is it thus that we speak to our kings 
yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name ’
and aragorn hearing him  turned and said  ‘verily  for in the high tongue
of old i am elessar  the elfstone  and envinyatar  the
renewer’  and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there  ‘but
strider shall be the name of my house  if that be ever established  in the high
tongue it will not sound so ill  and telcontar i will be and all the
heirs of my body ’
and with that they passed into the house  and as they went towards the rooms
where the sick were tended gandalf told of the deeds of éowyn and
meriadoc  ‘for ’ he said  ‘long have i stood by them and at first they
spoke much in their dreaming  before they sank into the deadly darkness 
also it is given to me to see many things far off ’
aragorn went first to faramir  and then to the lady éowyn  and last to
merry  when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed 
‘here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me ’ he said 
‘would that elrond were here  for he is the eldest of all our race  and has
the greater power ’
and éomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said  ‘first you
must rest  surely  and at the least eat a little ’
but aragorn answered  ‘nay  for these three  and most soon for faramir 
time is running out  all speed is needed ’
then he called to ioreth and he said  ‘you have store in this house of the
herbs of healing ’
‘yes  lord ’ she answered  ‘but not enough  i reckon  for all that will
need them  but i am sure i do not know where we shall find more  for all things
are amiss in these dreadful days  what with fires and burnings  and the lads
that run errands so few  and all the roads blocked  why  it is days out of count
since ever a carrier came in from lossarnach to the market  but we do our best
in this house with what we have  as i am sure your lordship will know ’
‘i will judge that when i see ’ said aragorn  ‘one thing also is short
time for speech  have you athelas ’
‘i do not know  i am sure  lord ’ she answered  ‘at least not by that
name  i will go and ask of the herb-master  he knows all the old names ’
‘it is also called kingsfoil ’ said aragorn  ‘and maybe you know
it by that name  for so the country-folk call it in these latter days ’ ‘oh
that ’ said ioreth  ‘well  if your lordship had named it at first i could
have told you  no  we have none of it  i am sure  why  i have never heard that
it had any great virtue  and indeed i have often said to my sisters when we came
upon it growing in the woods  “kingsfoil” i said  “ ‘tis a strange name 
and i wonder why ‘tis called so  for if i were a king  i would have plants
more bright in my garden”  still it smells sweet when bruised  does it not  if
sweet is the right word  wholesome  maybe  is nearer ’
‘wholesome verily ’ said aragorn  ‘and now  dame  if you love the lord
faramir  run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil  if there is a leaf in
the city ’
‘and if not ’ said gandalf  ‘i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth
behind me  and she shall take me to the woods  but not to her sisters  and
shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste ’
when ioreth was gone  aragorn bade the other women to make water hot  then he
took faramir s hand in his  and laid the other hand upon the sick man’s brow 
it was drenched with sweat  but faramir did not move or make any sign  and
seemed hardly to breathe 
‘he is nearly spent ’ said aragorn turning to gandalf  ‘but this comes
not from the wound  see  that is healing  had he
been smitten by some dart of the nazgûl  as you thought  he would have
died that night  this hurt was given by some southron arrow  i would guess  who
drew it forth  was it kept ’
‘i drew it forth ’ said imrahil  ‘and staunched the wound  but i did
not keep the arrow  for we had much to do  it was  as i remember  just such a
dart as the southrons use  yet i believed that it came from the shadows above 
for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood  since the wound was
not deep or vital  how then do you read the matter ’
‘weariness  grief for his father’s mood  a wound  and over all the black
breath ’ said aragorn  ‘he is a man of staunch will  for already he had come
close under the shadow before ever he rode to battle on the out-walls  slowly
the dark must have crept on him  even as he fought and strove to hold his
outpost  would that i could have been here sooner ’
thereupon the herb-master entered  ‘your lordship asked for kingsfoil  as
the rustics name it  he said  or athelas in the noble tongue  or to those
who know somewhat of the valinorean     ’
‘i do so ’ said aragorn  ‘and i care not whether you say now asëa
aranion or kingsfoil  so long as you have some ’
‘your pardon lord ’ said the man  ‘i see you are a lore-master  not
merely a captain of war  but alas  sir  we do not keep this thing in the houses
of healing  where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended  for it has no virtue
that we know of  save perhaps to sweeten a fouled air  or to drive away some
passing heaviness  unless  of course  you give heed to rhymes of old days which
women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding 
when the black breath blows

and death’s shadow grows

and all lights pass 

come athelas  come athelas 

life to the dying

in the king’s hand lying 
it is but a doggrel  i fear  garbled in the memory of old wives  its meaning
i leave to your judgement  if indeed it has any  but old folk still use an
infusion of the herb for headaches ’
‘then in the name of the king  go and find some old man of less lore and
more wisdom who keeps some in his house ’ cried gandalf 
now aragorn knelt beside faramir  and held a hand upon his brow  and those
that watched felt that some great struggle was going on  for aragorn’s face
grew grey with weariness  and ever and anon he called the name of faramir  but
each time more faintly to their hearing  as if aragorn himself was removed from
them  and walked afar in some dark vale  calling for one that was lost 
and at last bergil came running in  and he bore six leaves in a cloth  ‘it
is kingsfoil  sir ’ he said  ‘but not fresh  i fear  it must have been
culled two weeks ago at the least  i hope it will serve  sir ’ then looking at
faramir he burst into tears 
but aragorn smiled  ‘it will serve ’ he said  ‘the worst is now over 
stay and be comforted ’ then taking two leaves  he laid them on his hands and
breathed on them  and then he crushed them  and straightway a living freshness
filled the room  as if the air itself awoke and tingled  sparkling with joy  and
then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that were brought to
him  and at once all hearts were lightened  for the fragrance that came to each
was like a memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land of which the
fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory  but aragorn stood up as
one refreshed  and his eyes smiled as he held a bowl before faramir’s dreaming
face 
‘well now  who would have believed it ’ said ioreth to a woman that stood
beside her  ‘the weed is better than i thought  it reminds me of the roses of
imloth melui when i was a lass  and no king could ask for better ’
suddenly faramir stirred  and he opened his eyes  and he looked on aragorn
who bent over him  and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes 
and he spoke softly  ‘my lord  you called me  i come  what does the king
command ’
‘walk no more in the shadows  but awake ’ said aragorn  ‘you are weary 
rest a while  and take food  and be ready when i return ’
‘i will  lord ’ said faramir  ‘for who would lie idle when the king has
returned ’
‘farewell then for a while ’ said aragorn  ‘i must go to others who
need me ’ and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil  but beregond and
his son remained behind  unable to contain their joy  as he followed gandalf and
shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim 
‘king  did you hear that  what did i say  the hands of a healer  i said ’
and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was indeed come
among them  and after war he brought healing  and the news ran through the city 
but aragorn came to éowyn  and he said  ‘here there is a grievous
hurt and a heavy blow  the arm that was broken has been tended with due skill 
and it will mend in time  if she has the strength to live  it is the
shield-arm that is maimed  but the chief evil comes through the sword-arm  in
that there now seems no life  although it is unbroken 
‘alas  for she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind or
body  and those who will take a weapon to such an enemy must be sterner than
steel  if the very shock shall not destroy them  it was an evil doom that set
her in his path  for she is a fair maiden  fairest lady of a house of queens 
and yet i know not how i should speak of her  when i first looked on her and
perceived her unhappiness  it seemed to me that i saw a white flower standing
straight and proud  shapely as a lily  and yet knew that it was hard  as if
wrought by elf-wrights out of steel  or was it  maybe  a frost that had turned
its sap to ice  and so it stood  bitter-sweet  still fair to see  but stricken 
soon to fall and die  her malady begins far back before this day  does it not 
éomer ’
‘i marvel that you should ask me  lord ’ he answered  ‘for i hold you
blameless in this matter  as in all else  yet i
knew not that éowyn  my sister  was touched by any frost  until she first
looked on you  care and dread she had  and shared with me  in the days of
wormtongue and the king’s bewitchment  and she tended the king in growing fear 
but that did not bring her to this pass ’
‘my friend ’ said gandalf  ‘you had horses  and deeds of arms  and the
free fields  but she  born in the body of a maid  had a spirit and courage at
least the match of yours  yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man  whom she
loved as a father  and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured dotage  and her
part seemed to her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on 
‘think you that wormtongue had poison only for théoden’s ears  dotard 
what is the house of eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek 
and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs  have you not heard those
words before  saruman spoke them  the teacher of wormtongue  though i do not
doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped their meaning in terms more cunning  my
lord  if your sister’s love for you  and her will still bent to her duty  had
not restrained her lips  you might have heard even such things as these escape
them  but who knows what she spoke to the darkness  alone  in the bitter watches
of the night  when all her life seemed shrinking  and the walls of her bower
closing in about her  a hutch to trammel some wild thing in ’
then éomer was silent  and looked on his sister  as if pondering anew
all the days of their past life together  but aragorn said  ‘i saw also what
you saw  éomer  few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have
more bitterness and shame for a man’s heart than to behold the love of a lady
so fair and brave that cannot be returned sorrow and pity have followed me ever
since i left her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of the dead  and
no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her  and
yet  éomer  i say to you that she loves you more truly than me  for you
she loves and knows  but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought  a hope of
glory and great deeds  and lands far from the fields of rohan 
‘i have  maybe  the power to heal her body  and to recall her from the dark
valley  but to what she will awake  hope  or forgetfulness  or despair  i do not
know  and if to despair  then she will die  unless other healing comes which i
cannot bring  alas  for her deeds have set her among the queens of great
renown ’
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face  and it was indeed white as a
lily  cold as frost  and hard as graven stone  but he bent and kissed her on the
brow  and called her softly  saying 
‘éowyn éomund’s daughter  awake  for your enemy has passed
away ’
she did not stir  but now she began again to breathe deeply  so that her
breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet  once more aragorn
bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water  and he
laved her brow with it  and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the
coverlet 
then  whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse  or
whether it was but his words of the lady éowyn that wrought on them  as
the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those who
stood by that a keen wind blew through the window  and it bore no scent 
but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young  as if it had not before been
breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath
a dome of stars  or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam 
‘awake  éowyn  lady of rohan ’ said aragorn again  and he took her
right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning  ‘awake  the shadow is
gone and all darkness is washed clean ’ then he laid her hand in éomer’s
and stepped away  ‘call her ’ he said  and he passed silently from
the chamber 
‘éowyn  éowyn ’ cried éomer amid his tears  but she
opened her eyes and said  ‘éomer  what joy is this  for they said that
you were slain  nay  but that was only the dark voices in my dream  how
long have i been dreaming ’
‘not long  my sister ’ said éomer  ‘but think no more on it ’
‘ i am strangely weary ’ she said  ‘i must rest a little  but tell me 
what of the lord of the mark  alas  do not tell me that that was a dream for i
know that it was not  he is dead as he foresaw ’
‘he is dead ’ said éomer  ‘but he bade me say farewell to
éowyn dearer than daughter  he lies now in great honour in the citadel of
gondor ’
‘that is grievous ’ she said  ‘and yet it is good beyond all that i
dared hope in the dark days  when it seemed that
the house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherd’s cot  and what of
the king’s esquire  the halfling  éomer  you shall make him a knight of
the riddermark  for he is valiant ’
‘he lies nearby in this house  and i will go
to him ’ said gandalf  ‘éomer shall stay here for a while  but do not
speak yet of war or woe  until you are made whole again  great gladness it is to
see you wake again to health and hope  so valiant a lady ’
‘to health ’ said éowyn  ‘it may be so  at least while
there is an empty saddle of some fallen rider that i can fill  and there are
deeds to do  but to hope  i do not know ’
gandalf and pippin came to merry’s room  and there they found aragorn
standing by the bed  ‘poor old merry ’ cried pippin  and he ran to the
bedside  for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse  and a greyness was
in his face  as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him  and suddenly a fear
seized pippin that merry would die 
‘do not be afraid ’ said aragorn  ‘i came
in time  and i have called him back  he is weary now  and grieved  and he has
taken a hurt like the lady éowyn  daring to smite that deadly thing  but
these evils can be amended  so strong and gay a spirit is in him  his grief he
will not forget  but it will not darken his heart  it will teach him
wisdom ’
then aragorn laid his hand on merry’s head  and passing his hand gently
through the brown curls  he touched the eyelids  and called him by name  and
when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room  like the scent of
orchards  and of heather in the sunshine full of bees  suddenly merry awoke  and
he said 
‘i am hungry  what is the time ’
‘past supper-time now ’ said pippin  ‘though i daresay i could bring
you something  if they will let me ’
‘they will indeed ’ said gandalf  ‘and anything else that this rider of
rohan may desire  if it can be found in minas tirith  where his name is in
honour ’
‘good ’ said merry  ‘then i would like supper first  and after that a
pipe ’ at that his face clouded  ‘no  not a pipe  i don’t think i’ll
smoke again ’
‘why not ’ said pippin 
‘well ’ answered merry slowly  ‘he is dead  it has brought it all back
to me  he said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore with
me  almost the last thing he ever said  i shan’t ever be able to smoke again
without thinking of him  and that day  pippin  when he rode up to isengard and
was so polite ’
‘smoke then  and think of him ’ said aragorn  ‘for he was a gentle
heart and a great king and kept his oaths  and he rose out of the shadows to a
last fair morning  though your service to him was brief  it should be a memory
glad and honourable to the end of your days ’
merry smiled  ‘well then ’ he said  ‘if strider will provide what is
needed  i will smoke and think  i had some of saruman’s best in my pack  but
what became of it in the battle  i am sure i don’t know ’
‘master meriadoc ’ said aragorn  ‘if you think that i have passed
through the mountains and the realm of gondor with fire and sword to bring herbs
to a careless soldier who throws away his gear  you are mistaken  if your pack
has not been found  then you must send for the herb-master of this house  and he
will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire had any virtues  but
that it is called westmansweed by the vulgar  and galenas by the
noble  and other names in other tongues more learned  and after adding a few
half-forgotten rhymes that he does not understand  he will regretfully inform
you that there is none in the house  and he will leave you to reflect on the
history of tongues  and so now must i  for i have not slept in such a bed as
this  since i rode from dunharrow  nor eaten since the dark before dawn ’
merry seized his hand and kissed it  ‘i am frightfully sorry ’ he said 
‘go at once  ever since that night at bree we have been a nuisance to you  but
it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than
they mean  we fear to say too much  it robs us of the right words when a jest is
out of place ’
‘i know that well  or i would not deal with you in the same way ‘ said
aragorn  ‘may the shire live for ever unwithered ’ and kissing merry he went
out  and gandalf went with him 
pippin remained behind  ‘was there ever any one like him ’ he said 
‘except gandalf  of course  i think they must be related  my dear ass  your
pack is lying by your bed  and you had it on your back when i met you  he saw it
all the time  of course  and anyway i have some stuff of my own  come on now 
longbottom leaf it is  fill up while i run and see about some food  and then
let’s be easy for a bit  dear me  we tooks and brandybucks  we can’t live
long on the heights ’
‘no ’ said merry  ‘i can’t  not yet  at any rate  but at least 
pippin  we can now see them  and honour them  it is best to love first what you
are fitted to love  i suppose  you must start somewhere and have some roots  and
the soil of the shire is deep  still there are things deeper and higher  and not
a gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace but for them  whether he
knows about them or not  i am glad that i know about them  a little  but i
don’t know why i am talking like this  where is that leaf  and get my pipe out
of my pack  if it isn’t broken ’
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the houses of healing 
and they counselled him that faramir and éowyn should remain there and
still be tended with care for many days 
‘the lady éowyn ’ said aragorn  ‘will wish soon to rise and
depart  but she should not be permitted to do so  if you can in any way restrain
her  until at least ten days be passed ’
‘as for faramir ’ said gandalf  ‘he must soon learn that his father is
dead  but the full tale of the madness of denethor should not be told to him 
until he is quite healed and has duties to do  see that beregond and the perian
who were present do not speak to him of these things yet ’
and the other perian meriadoc who is under my care  what of him ’
said the warden 
‘it is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow  for a short while ’
said aragorn  ‘let him do so  if he wishes  he may walk a little in the care
of his friends ’
‘they are a remarkable race ’ said the warden  nodding his head  ‘very
tough in the fibre  i deem ’
at the doors of the houses many were already gathered to see aragorn  and
they followed after him  and when at last he had supped  men came and prayed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in peril
through hurt or wound  or who lay under the black shadow  and aragorn arose and
went out  and he sent for the sons of elrond  and together they laboured far
into the night  and word went through the city  ‘the king is come again
indeed ’ and they named him elfstone  because of the green stone that he wore 
and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen for him by his own people 
and when he could labour no more  he cast his cloak about him  and slipped
out of the city  and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a little  and
in the morning the banner of dol amroth  a white ship like a swan upon blue
water  floated from the tower  and men looked up and wondered if the coming of
the king had been but a dream 
 
the morning came after the day of battle  and it was fair with light clouds
and the wind turning westward  legolas and gimli were early abroad  and they
begged leave to go up into the city  for they were eager to see merry and
pippin 
‘it is good to learn that they are still alive ’ said gimli  ‘for they
cost us great pains in our march over rohan  and i would not have such pains all
wasted ’
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith  and folk that saw them
pass marvelled to see such companions  for legolas was fair of face beyond the
measure of men  and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the
morning  but gimli stalked beside him  stroking his beard and staring about him 
‘there is some good stone-work here ’ he said as he looked at the walls 
‘but also some that is less good  and the streets could be better contrived 
when aragorn comes into his own  i shall offer him the service of stonewrights
of the mountain  and we will make this a town to be proud of ’
‘they need more gardens ’ said legolas  ‘the houses are dead  and there
is too little here that grows and is glad  if aragorn comes into his own  the
people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die ’
at length they came to the prince imrahil  and legolas looked at him and
bowed low  for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his veins 
‘hail  lord ’ he said  ‘it is long since the people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lórien  and yet still one may see that not all sailed from
amroth’s haven west over water ’
‘so it is said in the lore of my land ’ said the prince  ‘yet never has
one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count  and i marvel to see
one here now in the midst of sorrow and war  what do you seek ’
‘i am one of the nine companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris 
said legolas and with this dwarf  my friend  i came with the lord aragorn  but
now we wish to see our friends  meriadoc and peregrin  who are in your keeping 
we are told ’
‘you will find them in the houses of healing  and i will lead you
thither ’ said imrahil 
‘it will be enough if you send one to guide
us  lord ’ said legolas  ‘for aragorn sends this message to you  he does not
wish to enter the city again at this time  yet there is need for the captains to
hold council at once  and he prays that you and éomer of rohan will come
down to his tents  as soon as may be  mithrandir is already there ’
‘we will come ’ said imrahil  and they parted with courteous words 
‘that is a fair lord and a great captain of men ’ said legolas  ‘if
gondor has such men still in these days of fading  great must have been its
glory in the days of its rising ’
‘and doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought in the
first building ’ said gimli  ‘it is ever so with the things that men begin 
there is a frost in spring  or a blight in summer  and they fail of their
promise ’
‘yet seldom do they fail of their seed ’ said legolas  ‘and that will
lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for  the
deeds of men will outlast us  gimli ’
‘and yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens  i guess ’ said
the dwarf 
‘to that the elves know not the answer ’ said legolas 
with that the servant of the prince came and led them to the houses of
healing  and there they found their friends in the garden  and their meeting was
a merry one  for a while they walked and talked  rejoicing for a brief space in
peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of the city  then
when merry became weary  they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of
the houses of healing behind them  and away southward before them was the anduin
glittering in the sun  as it flowed away  out of the sight even of legolas  into
the wide flats and green haze of lebennin and south ithilien 
and now legolas fell silent  while the others talked  and he looked out
against the sun  and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the river 
‘look ’ he cried  ‘gulls  they are flying far inland  a wonder they are
to me and a trouble to my heart  never in all my life had i met them  until we
came to pelargir  and there i heard them crying in the air as we rode to the
battle of the ships  then i stood still  forgetting war in middle-earth  for
their wailing voices spoke to me of the sea  the sea  alas  i have not yet
beheld it  but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing  which
it is perilous to stir  alas  for the gulls  no peace shall i have again under
beech or under elm ’
‘say not so ’ said gimli  ‘there are countless things still to see in
middle-earth  and great works to do  but if all the fair folk take to the
havens  it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay ’
‘dull and dreary indeed ’ said merry  ‘you must not go to the havens 
legolas  there will always be some folk  big or little  and even a few wise
dwarves like gimli  who need you  at least i hope so  though i feel somehow that
the worst of this war is still to come  how i wish it was all over  and well
over ’
‘don’t be so gloomy ’ cried pippin  ‘the sun is shining  and here we
are together for a day or two at least  i want to hear more about you all  come 
gimli  you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a
dozen times already this morning  but you haven’t told me anything about
it ’
‘the sun may shine here ’ said gimli  ‘but there are memories of that
road that i do not wish to recall out of the darkness  had i known what was
before me  i think that not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of
the dead ’
‘the paths of the dead ’ said pippin  ‘i heard aragorn say that and i
wondered what he could mean  won’t you tell us some more ’
‘not willingly ’ said gimli  ‘for upon that road i was put to shame 
gimli glóin’s son  who had deemed himself more tough than men  and
hardier under earth than any elf  but neither did i prove  and i was held
to the road only by the will of aragorn ’
‘and by the love of him also ’ said legolas  ‘for all those who come to
know him come to love him after his own fashion  even the cold maiden of the
rohirrim  it was at early morn of the day ere you came
there  merry  that we left dunharrow  and such a fear was on all the folk that
none would look on our going  save the lady éowyn  who lies now hurt in
the house below  there was grief at that parting  and i was grieved to behold
it ’
‘alas  i had heart only for myself ’ said gimli  ‘nay  i will not speak
of that journey ’
he fell silent  but pippin and merry were so eager for news that at last
legolas said  ‘i will tell you enough for your peace  for i felt not the
horror  and i feared not the shadows of men  powerless and frail as i deemed
them ’
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains  and the dark
tryst at erech  and the great ride thence  ninety leagues and three  to pelargir
on anduin  ‘four days and nights  and on into a fifth  we rode from the black
stone ’ he said  ‘and lo  in the darkness of mordor my hope rose  for in
that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible to look
upon  some i saw riding  some striding  yet all moving with the same great
speed  silent they were  but there was a gleam in their eyes  in the uplands of
lamedon they overtook our horses  and swept round us  and would have passed us
by  if aragorn had not forbidden them 
‘at his command they fell back  “even the shades of men are obedient to
his will ” i thought  “they may serve his needs yet  “
‘one day of light we rode  and then came the day without dawn  and still we
rode on  and ciril and ringló we crossed  and on the third day we came to
linhir above the mouth of gilrain  and there men of lamedon contested the
fords with fell folk of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river  but
defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we came  crying out
that the king of the dead was upon them  only angbor  lord of lamedon  had the
heart to abide us  and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come behind  if they
dared  when the grey host had passed 
‘ “at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you ” he said 
‘thus we crossed over gilrain  driving the allies of mordor in rout before
us  and then we rested a while  but soon aragorn arose  saying  “lo  already
minas tirith is assailed  i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid ” so
we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all the speed that our
horses could endure over the plains of lebennin ’
legolas paused and sighed  and turning his eyes southward softly he sang 
silver flow the streams from celos to erui

in the green fields of lebennin 

tall grows the grass there  in the wind from the sea

the white lilies sway 

and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin

in the green fields of lebennin 

in the wind from the sea 
‘green are those fields in the songs of my people  but they were dark then 
grey wastes in the blackness before us  and over the wide land  trampling
unheeded the grass and the flowers  we hunted our foes through a day and a
night  until we came at the bitter end to the great river at last 
‘then i thought in my heart that we drew near to the sea  for wide was the
water in the darkness  and sea-birds innumerable cried on its  shores  alas for
the wailing of the gulls  did not the lady tell me to beware of them  and now i
cannot forget them ’
‘for my part i heeded them not ’ said gimli  ‘for we came then at last
upon battle in earnest  there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar  fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count  many of those that we pursued had
reached the havens before us  and brought their fear with them  and some of the
ships had put off  seeking to escape down the river or to reach the far shore 
and many of the smaller craft were ablaze  but the haradrim  being now driven to
the brink  turned at bay  and they were fierce in despair  and they laughed when
they looked on us  for they were a great army still 
‘but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice  “now come  by the black
stone i call you  “ and suddenly the shadow host that had hung back at the
last came up like a grey tide  sweeping all away before it  faint cries i heard 
and dim horns blowing  and a murmur as of countless far voices  it was like the
echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago  pale swords were
drawn  but i know not whether their blades would still bite  for the dead needed
no longer any weapon but fear  none would withstand them 
‘to every ship they came that was drawn up  and then they passed over the
water to those that were anchored  and all the mariners were filled with a
madness of terror and leaped overboard  save the slaves chained to the oars 
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes  driving
them like leaves  until we came to the shore  and then to each of the great
ships that remained aragorn sent one of the dúnedain  and they comforted
the captives that were aboard  and bade them put aside fear and be free 
‘ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all were
drowned  or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot 
strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of mordor should be
overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness  with its own weapons was it
worsted ’
‘strange indeed ’ said legolas  ‘in that hour i looked on aragorn and
thought how great and terrible a lord he might have become in the strength of
his will  had he taken the ring to himself  not for naught does mordor
fear him  but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron  for is he
not of the children of lúthien  never shall that line fail  though the
years may lengthen beyond count ’
‘beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings ’ said gimli 
‘but mighty indeed was aragorn that day  lo  all the black fleet was in his
hands  and he chose the greatest ship to be his own  and he went up into it 
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy  and the
shadow host withdrew to the shore  there they stood silent  hardly to be seen 
save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were
burning  and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead men  crying 
‘ “hear now the words of the heir of isildur  your oath is fulfilled  go
back and trouble not the valleys ever again  depart and be at rest  “
‘and thereupon the king of the dead stood out before the host and broke his
spear and cast it down  then he bowed low and turned away  and swiftly the whole
grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by a sudden
wind  and it seemed to me that i awoke from a dream 
‘that night we rested while others laboured  for there were many captives
set free  and many slaves released who had been folk of gondor taken in raids 
and soon also there was a great gathering of men out of lebennin and the ethir 
and angbor of lamedon came up with all the horsemen that he could muster  now
that the fear of the dead was removed they came to aid us and to look on the
heir of isildur  for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark 
‘and that is near the end of our tale  for during that evening and night
many ships were made ready and manned  and in the morning the fleet set forth 
long past it now seems  yet it was but the morn of the day ere yesterday  the
sixth since we rode from dunharrow  but still aragorn was driven by fear that
time was too short 
‘ “it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the landings at the
harlond ” he said  “yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail
utterly ”
‘the oars were now wielded by free men  and manfully they laboured  yet
slowly we passed up the great river  for we strove against its stream  and
though that is not swift down in the south  we had no help of wind  heavy would
my heart have been  for all our victory at the havens  if legolas had not
laughed suddenly 
‘ “up with your beard  durin’s son  “ he said  “for thus is it
spoken  oft hope is born  when all is forlorn ” but what hope he saw
from afar he would not tell  when night came it did but deepen the darkness  and
our hearts were hot  for away in the north we saw a red glow under the cloud 
and aragorn said  “minas tirith is burning ”
‘but at midnight hope was indeed born anew  sea-crafty men of the ethir
gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the sea  long
ere day the masted ships hoisted sail  and our speed grew  until dawn whitened
the foam at our prows  and so it was  as you know  that we came in the third
hour of the morning with a fair wind and the sun unveiled  and we unfurled the
great standard in battle  it was a great day and a great hour  whatever may come
after ’
‘follow what may  great deeds are not lessened in worth ’ said legolas 
‘great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead  and great it shall
remain  though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to
come ’
‘and that may well befall ’ said gimli  ‘for the faces of aragorn and
gandalf are grave  much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents
there below  for my part  like merry  i wish that with our victory the war was
now over  yet whatever is still to do  i hope to have a part in it  for the
honour of the folk of the lonely mountain ’
‘and i for the folk of the great wood ’ said legolas  ‘and for the love
of the lord of the white tree ’
then the companions fell silent  but a while they sat there in the high
place  each busy with his own thoughts  while the captains debated 
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli  at once
he sent for éomer  and he went down with him from the city  and they came
to the tents of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place
where king théoden had fallen  and there they took counsel together with
gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond 
‘my lords ’ said gandalf  ‘listen to the words of the steward of gondor
before he died  you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day  but
against the power that has now arisen there is no victory  i do not bid you
despair  as he did  but to ponder the truth in these words 
‘the stones of seeing do not lie  and not even the lord of barad-dûr
can make them do so  he can  maybe  by his will choose what things shall be seen
by weaker minds  or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see 
nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great forces arrayed
against him in mordor  and more still being gathered  he saw that which truly
is 
‘hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault  the
next will be greater  this war then is without final hope  as denethor
perceived  victory cannot be achieved by arms  whether you sit here to endure
siege after siege  or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river  you have
only a choice of evils  and prudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong
places as you have  and there await the onset  for so shall the time before your
end be made a little longer ’
‘then you would have us retreat to minas tirith  or dol amroth  or to
dunharrow  and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is
flowing ’ said imrahil 
‘that would be no new counsel ’ said gandalf  ‘have you not done this
and little more in all the days of denethor  but no  i said this would be
prudent  i do not counsel prudence  i said victory could
not be achieved by arms  i still hope for victory  but not by arms  for into the
midst of all these policies comes the ring of power  the foundation of barad-dûr 
and the hope of sauron 
‘concerning this thing  my lords  you now all know enough for the
understanding of our plight  and of sauron’s  if he regains it  your valour is
vain  and his victory will be swift and complete  so complete that none can
foresee the end of it while this world lasts  if it is destroyed  then he will
fall  and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again 
for he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his
beginning  and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble  and he
will be maimed for ever  becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in
the shadows  but cannot again grow or take shape  and so a great evil of this
world will be removed 
‘other evils there are that may come  for sauron is himself but a servant
or emissary  yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world  but to
do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set  uprooting
the evil in the fields that we know  so that those who live after may have clean
earth to till  what weather they shall have is not ours to rule 
‘now sauron knows all this  and he knows that this precious thing which he
lost has been found again  but he does not yet know where it is  or so we hope 
and therefore he is now in great doubt  for if we have found this thing  there
are some among us with strength enough to wield it  that too he knows  for do i
not guess rightly  aragorn  that you have shown yourself to him in the stone of
orthanc ’
‘i did so ere i rode from the hornburg ’ answered aragorn  ‘i deemed
that the time was ripe  and that the stone had come to me for just such a
purpose  it was then ten days since the ring-bearer went east from rauros  and
the eye of sauron  i thought  should be drawn out from his own land  too seldom
has he been challenged since he returned to his tower  though if i had foreseen
how swift would be his onset in answer  maybe i should not have dared to show
myself  bare time was given me to come to your aid ’
‘but how is this ’ asked éomer  ‘all is vain  you say  if he has
the ring  why should he think it not vain to assail us  if we have it ’
‘he is not yet sure ’ said gandalf  ‘and he has not built up his power
by waiting until his enemies are secure  as we have done  also we could not
learn how to wield the full power all in a day  indeed it can be used only by
one master alone  not by many  and he will look for a time of strife  ere one of
the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others  in that time
the ring might aid him  if he were sudden 
‘he is watching  he sees much and hears much  his
nazgûl are still abroad  they passed over this field ere the sunrise 
though few of the weary and sleeping were aware of them  he studies the signs 
the sword that robbed him of his treasure re-made  the winds of fortune turning
in our favour  and the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault the fall
of his great captain 
‘his doubt will be growing  even as we speak here  his eye is now straining
towards us  blind almost to all else that is moving  so we must keep it  therein
lies all our hope  this  then  is my counsel  we have not the ring  in wisdom or
great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed  lest it destroy us  without
it we cannot by force defeat his force  but we must at all costs keep his eye
from his true peril  we cannot achieve victory by arms  but by arms we can give
the ring-bearer his only chance  frail though it be 
‘as aragorn has begun  so we must go on  we must push sauron to his last
throw  we must call out his hidden strength  so that he shall empty his land  we
must march out to meet him at once  we must make ourselves the bait  though his
jaws should close on us  he will take that bait  in hope and in greed  for he
will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of the new ringlord  and he
will say  “so  he pushes out his neck too soon and too far  let him come on 
and behold i will have him in a trap from which he cannot escape  there i will
crush him  and what he has taken in his insolence shall be mine again for
ever ”
‘we must walk open-eyed into that trap  with courage  but
small hope for ourselves  for  my lords  it may well prove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands  so that even
if barad-dûr be thrown down  we shall not live to see a new age  but this 
i deem  is our duty  and better so than to perish nonetheless - as we
surely shall  if we sit here - and know as we die that no new age shall be ’
they were silent for a while  at length aragorn spoke  ‘as i have begun  so
i will go on  we come now to the very brink  where hope and despair are akin  to
waver is to fall  let none now reject the counsels of gandalf  whose long
labours against sauron come at last to their test  but for him all would long
ago have been lost  nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man  let
others choose as they will ’
then said elrohir  ‘from the north we came with this purpose  and from
elrond our father we brought this very counsel  we will not turn back ’
‘as for myself ’ said éomer  ‘i have little knowledge of these
deep matters  but i need it not  this i know  and it is enough  that as
my friend aragorn succoured me and my people  so i will aid him when he calls  i
will go ’
‘as for me ’ said imrahil  ‘the lord aragorn i hold to be my
liege-lord  whether he claim it or no  his wish is to me a command  i will go
also  yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of gondor  and it is
mine to think first of its people  to prudence some heed must still be given 
for we must prepare against all chances  good as well as evil  now  it may be
that we shall triumph  and while there is any hope of this  gondor must be
protected  i would not have us return with victory to a city in ruins and a land
ravaged behind us  and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is an army
still unfought upon our northern flank ’
‘that is true ’ said gandalf  ‘i do not counsel you to leave the city
all unmanned  indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough for
any assault in earnest upon mordor  so long as it be great enough to challenge
battle  and it must move soon  therefore i ask the captains  what force could we
muster and lead out in two days’ time at the latest  and they must be hardy
men that go willingly  knowing their peril ’
‘all are weary  and very many have wounds light or grievous ’ said
éomer  ‘and we have suffered much loss of our horses  and that is ill
to bear  if we must ride soon  then i cannot hope to lead even two thousands 
and yet leave as many for the defence of the city ’
‘we have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ‘ said
aragorn  ‘new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs  now that the
coasts have been rid  four thousands i sent marching from pelargir through
lossarnach two days ago  and angbor the fearless rides before them  if we set
out in two days more  they will draw nigh ere we depart  moreover many were
bidden to follow me up the river in any craft they could gather  and with this
wind they will soon be at hand  indeed several ships have already come to the
harlond  i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse and foot  and
yet leave the city in better defence than it was when the assault began ’
‘the gate is destroyed ’ said imrahil  ‘and where now is the skill to
rebuild it and set it up anew ’
‘in erebor in the kingdom of dáin there is such skill ’ said
aragorn  ‘and if all our hopes do not perish  then in time i will send gimli
glóin’s son to ask for wrights of the mountain  but men are better than
gates  and no gate will endure against our enemy if men desert it ’
this then was the end of the debate of the lords  that they should set forth
on the second morning from that day with seven thousands  if these might be
found  and the great part of this force should be on foot  because of the evil
lands into which they would go  aragorn should find
some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the south  but
imrahil should find three and a half thousands  and éomer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy  and he himself
should lead five hundreds of his best riders on horse  and another company of
five hundred horse there should be  among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dúnedain and the knights of dol amroth  all told six thousand
foot and a thousand horse  but the main strength of the rohirrim that remained
horsed and able to fight  some three thousand under the command of elfhelm 
should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in anórien  and at
once swift riders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards  and
eastwards from osgiliath and the road to minas morgul 
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken thought for the
journeys they should make and the roads they should choose  imrahil suddenly
laughed aloud 
‘surely ’ he cried  ‘this is the greatest jest in all the history of
gondor  that we should ride with seven thousands  scarce as many as the vanguard
of its army in the days of its power  to assail the mountains and the
impenetrable gate of the black land  so might a child threaten a mail-clad
knight with a bow of string and green willow  if the dark lord knows so much as
you say  mithrandir  will he not rather smile than fear  and with his little
finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him ’
‘no  he will try to trap the fly and take the sting ’ said gandalf 
‘and there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad
knights apiece  no  he will not smile ’
‘neither shall we ’ said aragorn  ‘if this be jest  then it is too
bitter for laughter  nay  it is the last move in a
great jeopardy  and for one side or the other it will bring the end of the
game ’ then he drew andúril and held it up glittering in the sun 
‘you shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought ’ he said 
 
two days later the army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor  the
host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out of anórien  but harried
and scattered by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting
towards cair andros  and with that threat destroyed and new strength
arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be  scouts
reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross-roads
of the fallen king  all now was ready for the last throw 
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in
the company of aragorn and gandalf  who went in the van with the dúnedain
and the sons of elrond  but merry to his shame was not to go with them 
‘you are not fit for such a journey ’ said aragorn  ‘but do not be
ashamed  if you do no more in this war  you have already earned great honour 
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk  and do not grudge him his chance
of peril  for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him  he has yet
to match your deed  but in truth all now are in like danger  though it may be
our part to find bitter end before the gate of mordor  if we do so  then you
will come also to a last stand  either here or wherever the black tide overtakes
you  farewell ’
and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army 
bergil was with him  and he also was downcast  for his father was to march
leading a company of the men of the city  he could not rejoin the guard until
his case was judged  in that same company pippin was also to go  as a soldier of
gondor  merry could see him not far off  a small but upright figure among the
tall men of minas tirith 
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move  troop by troop  and
company by company  they wheeled and went off eastward  and long after they had
passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway  merry stood there 
the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost  and
still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart  feeling friendless and alone 
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the gloom that hung over the
distant eastern sky  and little hope at all was left in his heart that he would
ever see any of them again 
as if recalled by his mood of despair  the pain in his arm returned  and he
felt weak and old  and the sunlight seemed thin  he was roused by the touch of
bergil’s hand 
‘come  master perian ’ said the lad  ‘you are still in pain  i see  i
will help you back to the healers  but do not fear  they will come back  the men
of minas tirith will never be overcome  and now they have the lord elfstone  and
beregond of the guard too ’
ere noon the army came to osgiliath  there all the workers and craftsmen that
could be spared were busy  some were strengthening the ferries and boat-bridges
that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when they fled  some gathered
stores and booty  and others on the eastern side across the river were throwing
up hasty works of defence 
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor  and over the wide
river  and on up the long straight road that in the high days had been made to
run from the fair tower of the sun to the tall tower of the moon  which now was
minas morgul in its accursed vale  five miles beyond osgiliath they halted 
ending their first day’s march 
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the cross-roads and
the great ring of trees  and all was silent  no sign of any enemy had they seen 
no cry or call had been heard  no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the
way  yet ever as they went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land
increase  tree and stone  blade and leaf were listening  the darkness had been
dispelled  and far away westward sunset was on the vale of anduin  and the white
peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air  but
a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel dúath 
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the ring
of trees  and they blew a great fanfare  and the heralds cried aloud  ‘the
lords of gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they take
back ’ the hideous orc-head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down
and broken in pieces  and the old king’s head was raised and set in its place
once more  still crowned with white and golden flowers  and men laboured to wash
and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone 
now in their debate some had counselled that minas morgul should first be
assailed  and if they might take it  it should be utterly destroyed  ‘and 
maybe ’ said imrahil  ‘the road that leads thence to the pass above will
prove an easier way of assault upon the dark lord than his northern gate ’
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently  because of the evil that dwelt
in the valley  where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror 
and because also of the news that faramir had brought  for if the ring-bearer
had indeed attempted that way  then above all they should not draw the eye of
mordor thither  so the next day when the main host came up  they set a strong
guard upon the cross-roads to make some defence  if mordor should send a force
over the morgul pass  or should bring more men up from the south  for that guard
they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the
woods and slopes about the meeting of the ways  but gandalf and aragorn rode
with the vanguard to the entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city 
it was dark and lifeless  for the orcs and lesser creatures of mordor that
had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle  and
the nazgûl were abroad  yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and
enmity  then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields
and departed 
the day after  being the third day since they set out from minas tirith  the
army began its northward march along the road  it was some hundred miles by that
way from the cross-roads to the morannon  and what might befall them before they
came so far none knew they went openly but heedfully  with mounted
scouts before them on the road  and others on foot upon either side  especially
on the eastward flank  for there lay dark thickets  and a tumbled land of rocky
ghylls and crags  behind which the long grim slopes of the ephel dúath
clambered up  the weather of the world remained fair and the wind held in
the west  but nothing could waft away the glooms and the sad mists that clung
about the mountains of shadow  and behind them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds 
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets  and the heralds would cry 
“the lords of gondor are come  let all leave this land or yield them up ’
but imrahil said  ‘say not the lords of gondor  say the king elessar 
for that is true  even though he has not yet sat upon the throne  and it will
give the enemy more thought  if the heralds use that name ’ and thereafter
thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the king elessar  but none
answered the challenge 
nonetheless  though they marched in seeming peace  the hearts of all the
army  from the highest to the lowest  were downcast  and with every mile that
they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them  it was near the end of
the second day of their march from the cross-roads that they first met any offer
of battle  for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to take their
leading companies in an ambush  and that was in the very place where faramir had
waylaid the men of harad  and the road went in a deep cutting through an
out-thrust of the eastward hills  but the captains
of the west were well warned by their scouts  skilled men from henneth annûn
led by mablung  and so the ambush was itself trapped  for horsemen went wide
about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind  and
they were destroyed or driven east into the hills 
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains  ‘it is but a
feint ’ said aragorn  ‘and its chief purpose  i deem  was rather to draw us
on by a false guess of our enemy’s weakness than to do us much
hurt  yet ’ and from that evening onward the nazgûl came and followed
every move of the army  they still flew high and out of sight of all save
legolas  and yet their presence could be felt  as a deepening of shadow and a
dimming of the sun  and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent  uttering no cry  the dread of them could not be
shaken off 
so time and the hopeless journey wore away  upon the fourth day from the
cross-roads and the sixth from minas tirith they came at last to the end of the
living lands  and began to pass into the desolation that lay before the gates of
the pass of cirith gorgor  and they could descry the marshes and the desert that
stretched north and west to the emyn muil  so desolate were those places and so
deep the horror that lay on them that some of the host were unmanned  and they
could neither walk nor ride further north 
aragorn looked at them  and there was pity in his eyes rather than wrath  for
these were young men from rohan  from westfold far away  or husbandmen from
lossarnach  and to them mordor had been from childhood a name of evil  and yet
unreal  a legend that had no part in their simple life  and now they walked like
men in a hideous dream made true  and they understood not this war nor why fate
should lead them to such a pass 
‘go ’ said aragorn  ‘but keep what honour you may  and do not run  and
there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed  take your way
south-west till you come to cair andros  and if that is still held by enemies 
as i think  then re-take it  if you can  and hold it to the last in defence of
gondor and rohan ’
then some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on  and the
others took new hope  hearing of a manful deed within their measure that they
could turn to  and they departed  and so  since many men had already been left
at the cross-roads  it was with less than six thousands that the captains of the
west came at last to challenge the black gate and the might of mordor 
they advanced now slowly  expecting at every hour some answer to their
challenge  and they drew together  since it was but waste of men to send out
scouts or small parties from the main host  at nightfall of the fifth day of the
march from morgul vale they made their last camp  and set fires about it of such
dead wood and heath as they could find  they passed the hours of night in
wakefulness and they were aware of many things half-seen that walked and prowled
all about them  and they heard the howling of wolves  the wind had died and all
the air seemed still  they could see little  for though it was cloudless and the
waxing moon was four nights old  there were smokes and fumes that rose out of
the earth and the white crescent was shrouded in the mists of mordor 
it grew cold  as morning came the wind began to stir again  but now it came
from the north  and soon it freshened to a rising breeze  all the night-walkers
were gone  and the land seemed empty  north amid their noisome pits lay the
first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and blasted earth 
the vomit of the maggot-folk of mordor  but south and now near loomed the great
rampart of cirith gorgor  and the black gate amidmost  and the two towers of the
teeth tall and dark upon either side  for in their last march the captains had
turned away from the old road as it bent east  and avoided the peril of the
lurking hills  and so now they were approaching the morannon from the
north-west  even as frodo had done 
the two vast iron doors of the black gate under its frowning arch were fast
closed  upon the battlement nothing could be seen  all was silent but watchful 
they were come to the last end of their folly  and stood forlorn and chill in
the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their army could not
assault with hope  not even if it had brought thither engines of great power 
and the enemy had no more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate
and wall alone  yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about the morannon
were filled with hidden foes  and the shadowy defile beyond was bored and
tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things  and as they stood they saw all the
nazgûl gathered together  hovering above the towers of the teeth like
vultures  and they knew that they were watched  but still the enemy made
no sign 
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end  therefore aragorn
now set the host in such array as could best be contrived  and they were drawn
up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of
labour  before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud
and foul-smelling pools  when all was ordered  the captains rode forth towards
the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds
and trumpeters  there was gandalf as chief herald  and aragorn with the sons of
elrond  and éomer of rohan  and imrahil  and legolas and gimli and
peregrin were bidden to go also  so that all the enemies of mordor should have a
witness 
they came within cry of the morannon  and unfurled the banner  and blew upon
their trumpets  and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the
battlement of mordor 
‘come forth ’ they cried  ‘let the lord of the black land come forth 
justice shall be done upon him  for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and
wrested its lands  therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone for
his evils  and depart then for ever  come forth ’
there was a long silence  and from wall and gate no cry or sound was heard in
answer  but sauron had already laid his plans  and he had a mind first to play
these mice cruelly before he struck to kill  so it was that  even as the
captains were about to turn away  the silence was broken suddenly  there came a
long rolling of great drums like thunder in the mountains  and then a braying of
horns that shook the very stones and stunned men’s ears  and thereupon the
middle door of the black gate was thrown open with a great clang  and out of it
there came an embassy from the dark tower 
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape  mounted upon a black horse  if
horse it was  for it was huge and hideous  and its face was a frightful mask 
more like a skull than a living head  and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flame  the rider was robed
all in black  and black was his lofty helm  yet this was no ringwraith but a
living man  the lieutenant of the tower of barad-dûr he was  and his name
is remembered in no tale  for he himself had forgotten it  and he said  ‘i am
the mouth of sauron ’ but it is told that he was a renegade  who came of the
race of those that are named the black númenóreans  for they
established their dwellings in middle-earth during the years of sauron’s
domination  and they worshipped him  being enamoured of evil knowledge 
and he entered the service of the dark tower when it first rose again  and
because of his cunning he grew ever higher in the lord’s favour  and he
learned great sorcery  and knew much of the mind of sauron  and he was more
cruel than any orc 
he it was that now rode out  and with him came only a small company of
black-harnessed soldiery  and a single banner  black but bearing on it in red
the evil eye  now halting a few paces before the captains of the west he looked
them up and down and laughed 
‘is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me ’ he asked 
‘or indeed with wit to understand me  not thou at least ’ he mocked  turning
to aragorn with scorn  ‘it needs more to make a king than a piece of elvish
glass  or a rabble such as this  why  any brigand of the hills can show as good
a following ’
aragorn said naught in answer  but he took the other’s eye and held it  and
for a moment they strove thus  but soon  though aragorn did not stir nor move
hand to weapon  the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow  ‘i
am a herald and ambassador  and may not be assailed ’ he cried 
‘where such laws hold ’ said gandalf  ‘it is also the custom for
ambassadors to use less insolence  but no one has threatened you  you have
naught to fear from us  until your errand is done  but unless your master has
come to new wisdom  then with all his servants you will be in great peril ’
‘so ’ said the messenger  ‘then thou art the spokesman  old greybeard 
have we not heard of thee at whiles  and of thy wanderings  ever hatching plots
and mischief at a safe distance  but this time thou hast stuck out thy nose too
far  master gandalf  and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets his foolish
webs before the feet of sauron the great  i have tokens that i was bidden to
show to thee - to thee in especial  if thou shouldst dare to come ’ he signed
to one of his guards  and he came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black
cloths 
the messenger put these aside  and there to the wonder and dismay of all the
captains he held up first the short sword that sam had carried  and next a grey
cloak with an elven-brooch  and last the coat of mithril-mail that frodo had
worn wrapped in his tattered garments  a blackness came before their eyes  and
it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the world stood still  but their
hearts were dead and their last hope gone  pippin who stood behind prince
imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief 
‘silence ’ said gandalf sternly  thrusting him back  but the messenger
laughed aloud 
‘so you have yet another of these imps with you ’ he cried  ‘what use
you find in them i cannot guess  but to send them as spies into mordor is beyond
even your accustomed folly  still  i thank him  for it is plain that this brat
at least has seen these tokens before  and it would be vain for you to deny them
now ’
‘i do not wish to deny them ’ said gandalf  ‘indeed  i know them all
and all their history  and despite your scorn  foul mouth of sauron  you cannot
say as much  but why do you bring them here ’
‘dwarf-coat  elf-cloak  blade of the downfallen west  and spy from the
little rat-land of the shire-nay  do not start  we know it well - here are the
marks of a conspiracy  now  maybe he that bore these things was a creature that
you would not grieve to lose  and maybe otherwise  one dear to you  perhaps  if
so  take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you  for sauron does not
love spies  and what his fate shall be depends now on your choice ’
no one answered him  but he saw their faces grey with fear and the horror in
their eyes  and he laughed again  for it seemed to him that his sport went well 
‘good  good ’ he said  ‘he was dear to you  i see  or else his errand was
one that you did not wish to fail  it has  and now he shall endure the slow
torment of years  as long and slow as our arts in the great tower can contrive 
and never be released  unless maybe when he is changed and broken  so that he
may come to you  and you shall see what you have done  this shall surely
be-unless you accept my lord’s terms ’
‘name the terms ’ said gandalf steadily  but those nearby saw the anguish
in his face  and now he seemed an old and wizened man  crushed  defeated at
last  they did not doubt that he would accept 
‘these are the terms ’ said the messenger  and smiled as he eyed them one
by one  ‘the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at once
beyond the anduin  first taking oaths never again to assail sauron the great in
arms  open or secret  all lands east of anduin shall be sauron’s for ever 
solely  west of the anduin as far as the misty mountains and the gap of rohan
shall be tributary to mordor  and men there shall bear no weapons  but shall
have leave to govern their own affairs  but they shall help to rebuild isengard
which they have wantonly destroyed  and that shall be sauron’s  and there his
lieutenant shall dwell  not saruman  but one more worthy of trust ’
looking in the messenger’s eyes they read his thought  he was to be that
lieutenant  and gather all that remained of the west under his sway  he would be
their tyrant and they his slaves 
but gandalf said  ‘this is much to demand for the delivery of one servant 
that your master should receive in exchange what he must else fight many a war
to gain  or has the field of gondor destroyed his hope in war  so that he falls
to haggling  and if indeed we rated this prisoner so high  what surety have we
that sauron the base master of treachery  will keep his part  where is this
prisoner  let him be brought forth and yielded to us  and then we will consider
these demands ’
it seemed then to gandalf  intent  watching him as a man engaged in fencing
with a deadly foe  that for the taking of a breath the messenger was at a loss 
yet swiftly he laughed again 
‘do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron ’ he
cried  ‘surety you crave  sauron gives none  if you sue for his clemency you
must first do his bidding  these are his terms  take them or leave them ’
‘these we will take ’ said gandalf suddenly  he cast aside his cloak and
a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place  before his upraised
hand the foul messenger recoiled  and gandalf coming seized and took from him
the tokens  coat  cloak  and sword  ‘these we will take in memory of our
friend ’ he cried  ‘but as for your terms  we reject them utterly  get you
gone  for your embassy is over and death is near to you  we did not come here to
waste words in treating with sauron  faithless and accursed  still less with one
of his slaves  begone ’
then the messenger of mordor laughed no more  his face was twisted with
amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that  as it crouches on
its prey  is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod  rage filled him and his
mouth slavered  and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from his throat 
but he looked at the fell faces of the captains and their deadly eyes  and fear
overcame his wrath  he gave a great cry  and turned  leaped upon his steed  and
with his company galloped madly back to cirith gorgor  but as they went his
soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged  and even before they came to
the gate sauron sprang his trap 
drums rolled and fires leaped up  the great doors of the black gate swung
back wide  out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirling waters when a
sluice is lifted 
the captains mounted again and rode back  and from the host of mordor there
went up a jeering yell  dust rose smothering the air  as from nearby there
marched up an army of easterlings that had waited for the signal in the shadows
of ered lithui beyond the further tower  down from the hills on either side of
the morannon poured orcs innumerable  the men of the west were trapped  and
soon  all about the grey mounds where they stood  forces ten times and more than
ten times their match would ring them in a sea of enemies  sauron had taken the
proffered bait in jaws of steel 
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle  upon the one
hill he stood with gandalf  and there fair and desperate was raised the banner
of the tree and stars  upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of rohan
and dol amroth  white horse and silver swan  and about each hill a ring was made
facing all ways  bristling with spear and sword  but
in the front towards mordor where the first bitter assault would come there
stood the sons of elrond on the left with the dúnedain about them  and on
the right the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth tall and fair  and
picked men of the tower of guard 
the wind blew  and the trumpets sang  and arrows whined  but the sun now
climbing towards the south was veiled in the reeks of mordor  and through a
threatening haze it gleamed  remote  a sullen red  as if it were the ending of
the day  or the end maybe of all the world of
light  and out of the gathering mirk the nazgûl came with  their cold
voices crying words of death  and then all hope was quenched 
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf reject the terms
and doom frodo to the torment of the tower  but he had mastered himself  and now
he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil’s men  for
it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life  since
all was in ruin 
‘i wish merry was here ’ he heard himself saying  and quick thoughts
raced through his mind  even as he watched the enemy come charging to the
assault  ‘well  well  now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little
better  we might die together  merry and i  and since die we must  why not 
well  as he is not here  i hope he’ll find an easier end  but now i must do my
best ’
he drew his sword and looked at it  and the intertwining shapes of red and
gold  and the flowing characters of númenor glinted like fire upon the
blade  ‘this was made for just such an hour ’ he thought  ‘if only
i could smite that foul messenger with it  then almost i should draw level with
old merry  well  i’ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end  i wish
i could see cool sunlight and green grass again ’
then even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them  the
orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and poured their
arrows into the defending ranks  but through them there came striding up 
roaring like beasts  a great company of hill-trolls out of gorgoroth  taller and
broader than men they were  and they were clad only in close-fitting mesh of
horny scales  or maybe that was their hideous hide  but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands  reckless they
sprang into the pools and waded across  bellowing as they came  like a storm
they broke upon the line of the men of gondor  and beat upon helm and head  and
arm and shield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron  at pippin’s side
beregond was stunned and overborne  and he fell  and the great troll-chief that
smote him down bent over him  reaching out a clutching claw  for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down 
then pippin stabbed upwards  and the written blade of westernesse pierced
through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll  and his black blood
came gushing out  he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock 
burying those beneath him  blackness and stench and crushing pain came upon
pippin  and his mind fell away into a great darkness 
‘so it ends as i guessed it would ’ his thought said  even as it
fluttered away  and it laughed a little within him ere it fled  almost gay it
seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear  and then even as
it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices  and they seemed to be crying
in some forgotten world far above 
‘the eagles are coming  the eagles are coming ’
for one moment more pippin’s thought hovered  ‘bilbo ’ it said  ‘but
no  that came in his tale  long long ago  this is my tale  and it is ended now 
good-bye ’ and his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more 
 
 
 
sam roused himself painfully from the ground  for a moment he wondered where
he was  and then all the misery and despair returned to him  he was in the deep
dark outside the under-gate of the orcs  stronghold  its brazen doors were shut 
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them  but how long he
had lain there he did not know  then he had been on fire  desperate and furious 
now he was shivering and cold  he crept to the doors and pressed his ears
against them 
far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamouring  but soon they
stopped or passed out of hearing  and all was still  his head ached and his eyes
saw phantom lights in the darkness  but he struggled to steady himself and
think  it was clear at any rate that he had no hope of getting into the orc-hold
by that gate  he might wait there for days before it was opened  and he could
not wait  time was desperately precious  he no longer had any doubt about his
duty  he must rescue his master or perish in the attempt 
‘the perishing is more likely  and will be a lot easier anyway ’ he said
grimly to himself  as he sheathed sting and turned from the brazen doors  slowly
he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel  not daring to use the
elven-light  and as he went he tried to fit together the events since frodo and
he had left the cross-roads  he wondered what the time was  somewhere between
one day and the next  he supposed  but even of the days he had quite lost count 
he was in a land of darkness where the days of the world seemed forgotten  and
where all who entered were forgotten too 
‘i wonder if they think of us at all ’ he said  ‘and what is happening
to them all away there ’ he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him  but
he was in fact now facing southwards  as he came back to shelob’s tunnel  not
west  out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day
of march in the shire-reckoning  and even now aragorn was leading the black
fleet from pelargir  and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain
valley  while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness
growing in the eyes of denethor  yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts
of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam  they were not forgotten 
but they were far beyond aid  and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise
hamfast’s son  he was utterly alone 


he came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage  and still unable to
discover the catch or bolt that held it  he scrambled over as before and dropped
softly to the ground  then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelob’s tunnel  where the rags of her great web were still blowing and
swaying in the cold airs  for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind  but the breath of them revived him  he crept cautiously out 
all was ominously quiet  the light was no more than that of dusk at a dark
day’s end  the vast vapours that arose in mordor and went streaming westward
passed low overhead  a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath
with a sullen glow of red 
sam looked up towards the orc-tower  and suddenly from its narrow windows
lights stared out like small red eyes  he wondered if they were some signal  his
fear of the orcs  forgotten for a while in his wrath and desperation  now
returned  as far as he could see  there was only one possible course for him to
take  he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower  but
his knees felt weak  and he found that he was trembling  drawing his eyes down
from the tower and the horns of the cleft before him  he forced his unwilling
feet to obey him  and slowly  listening with all his ears  peering into the
dense shadows of the rocks beside the way  he retraced his steps  past the place
where frodo fell  and still the stench of shelob lingered  and then on and up 
until he stood again in the very cleft where he had put on the ring and seen
shagrat’s company go by 
there he halted and sat down  for the moment he could drive himself no
further  he felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took one
step veritably down into the land of mordor  that step would be irrevocable  he
could never come back  without any clear purpose he drew out the ring and put it
on again  immediately he felt the great burden of its weight  and felt afresh 
but now more strong and urgent than ever  the malice of the eye of mordor 
searching  trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own defence 
but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt 
as before  sam found that his hearing was sharpened  but that to his sight
the things of this world seemed thin and vague  the rocky walls of the path were
pale  as if seen through a mist  but still at a distance he heard the bubbling
of shelob in her misery  and harsh and clear  and very close it seemed  he heard
cries and the clash of metal  he sprang to his feet  and pressed himself against
the wall beside the road  he was glad of the ring  for here was yet another
company of orcs on the march  or so at first he thought  then suddenly he
realized that it was not so  his hearing had deceived him  the orc-cries came
from the tower  whose topmost horn was now right above him  on the left hand of
the cleft 
sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move  there was plainly some
devilry going on  perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had
mastered them  and they were tormenting frodo  or even savagely hacking him to
pieces  he listened  and as he did a gleam of hope came to him  there could not
be much doubt  there was fighting in the tower  the orcs must be at war among
themselves  shagrat and gorbag had come to blows  faint as was the hope that his
guess brought him  it was enough to rouse him  there might be just a chance  his
love for frodo rose above all other thoughts  and forgetting his peril he cried
aloud  ‘i’m coming  mr  frodo ’
he ran forward to the climbing path  and over it  at once the road turned
left and plunged steeply down  sam had crossed into mordor 


he took off the ring  moved it may be by some deep premonition of danger  though
to himself he thought only that he wished to see more clearly  `better have a
look at the worst ’ he muttered  `no good blundering about in a fog ’
hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze  before his feet the
highest ridge of the ephel dúath fell
steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough  on the further side of which
there rose another ridge  much lower  its edge notched and jagged with crags
like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them  it was
the grim morgai  the inner ring of the fences of the land  far beyond it  but
almost straight ahead  across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires 
there was a great burning glow  and from it rose in huge columns a swirling
smoke  dusty red at the roots  black above where it merged into the billowing
canopy that roofed in all the accursed land 
sam was looking at orodruin  the mountain of fire  ever and anon the furnaces
far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides  some would flow
blazing towards barad-dûr down great channels  some would wind their way
into the stony plain  until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes
vomited from the tormented earth  in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount
doom  and the light of it  cut off by the high screen of the ephel dúath
from those who climbed up the path from the west  now glared against the stark
rock faces  so that they seemed to be drenched with blood 
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast  for now  looking to his left  he
could see the tower of cirith ungol in all its strength  the horn that he had
seen from the other side was only its topmost turret  its eastern face stood up
in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far below  its back was
to a great cliff behind  from which it jutted out in pointed bastions  one above
the other  diminishing as they rose  with sheer sides of cunning masonry that
looked north-east and south-east  about the lowest tier  two hundred feet below
where sam now stood  there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court  its
gate  upon the near south-eastern side  opened on a broad road  the outer
parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice  until
it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness to join the road
that came over the morgul pass  then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad-dûr  the narrow
upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path
to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to the tower-gate 
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood  almost with a shock  that this
stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of mordor  but to keep them
in  it was indeed one of the works of gondor long ago  an eastern outpost of the
defences of ithilien  made when  after the last alliance  men of westernesse
kept watch on the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurked  but as
with narchost and carchost  the towers of the teeth  so here too the vigilance
had failed  and treachery had yielded up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths  and now for long years it had been held by evil things  since his
return to mordor  sauron had found it useful  for he had few servants but many
slaves of fear  and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from
mordor  though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly 
then it was also a last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the
vigilance of morgul and of shelob 
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under
those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate  and even if he did so  he
could not go far on the guarded road beyond  not even the black shadows  lying
deep where the red glow could not reach  would shield him long from the
night-eyed orcs  but desperate as that road might be  his task was now far
worse  not to avoid the gate and escape  but to enter it  alone 


his thought turned to the ring  but there was no comfort there  only dread and
danger  no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom  burning far away  than he
was aware of a change in his burden  as it drew near the great furnaces where 
in the deeps of time  it had been shaped and forged  the ring’s power grew 
and it became more fell  untameable save by some mighty will  as sam stood
there  even though the ring was not on him but hanging by its chain about his
neck  he felt himself enlarged  as if he were robed in a huge distorted shadow
of himself  a vast and ominous threat halted upon the walls of mordor  he felt
that he had from now on only two choices  to forbear the ring  though it would
torment him  or to claim it  and challenge the power that sat in its dark hold
beyond the valley of shadows  already the ring tempted him  gnawing at his will
and reason  wild fantasies arose in his mind  and he saw samwise the strong 
hero of the age  striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land  and
armies flocking to his call as he marched to the
overthrow of barad-dûr  and then all the clouds rolled away  and the white
sun shone  and at his command the vale of gorgoroth became a garden of flowers
and trees and brought forth fruit  he had only to put on the ring and
claim it for his own  and all this could be 
in that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold
him firm  but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain
hobbit-sense  he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to
bear such a burden  even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him 
the one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due  not a garden
swollen to a realm  his own hands to use  not the hands of others to command 
‘and anyway all these notions are only a trick ’ he said to himself 
‘he’d spot me and cow me  before i could so much as shout out  he’d spot
me  pretty quick  if i put the ring on now  in mordor  well  all i can say is 
things look as hopeless as a frost in spring  just when being invisible would be
really useful  i can’t use the ring  and if ever i get any further  it’s
going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step  so what’s to be
done ’
he was not really in any doubt  he knew that he must go down to the gate and
not linger any more  with a shrug of his shoulders  as if to shake off the
shadow and dismiss the phantoms  he began slowly to descend  with each step he
seemed to diminish  he had not gone far before he had shrunk again to a very
small and frightened hobbit  he was now passing under the very walls of the
tower  and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard with his unaided
ears  at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the court behind the
outer wall 


sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red
glow there came two orcs running  they did not turn towards him  they were
making for the main road  but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the
ground and lay still  sam had seen no arrows  but he guessed that the orcs had
been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate 
he went on  hugging the wall on his left  one look upward had shown him that
there was no hope of climbing it  the stone-work rose thirty feet  without a
crack or ledge  to overhanging courses like inverted steps  the gate was the
only way 
he crept on  and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived in the tower with
shagrat  and how many gorbag had  and what they were quarrelling about  if that
was what was happening  shagrat’s company had seemed to be about forty  and
gorbag’s more than twice as large  but of course shagrat’s patrol had only
been a part of his garrison  almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo 
and the spoil  for a second sam halted  for suddenly things seemed clear to him 
almost as if he had seen them with his eyes  the mithril coat  of course  frodo
was wearing it  and they would find it  and from what sam had heard gorbag would
covet it  but the orders of the dark tower were at present frodo’s only
protection  and if they were set aside  frodo might be killed out of hand at any
moment 
‘come on  you miserable sluggard ’ sam cried to himself  `now for it ’
he drew sting and ran towards the open gate  but just as he was about to pass
under its great arch he felt a shock  as if he had run into some web like
shelob’s  only invisible  he could see no obstacle  but something too strong
for his will to overcome barred the way  he looked about  and then within the
shadow of the gate he saw the two watchers 
they were like great figures seated upon thrones  each had three joined
bodies  and three heads facing outward  and inward  and across the gateway  the
heads had vulture-faces  and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands  they
seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone  immovable  and yet they were
aware  some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them  they knew an enemy 
visible or invisible none could pass unheeded  they would forbid his entry  or
his escape 
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again  and halted with a jerk 
staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head  then greatly daring 
because he could think of nothing else to do  answering a sudden thought that
came to him  he drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up  its white
light quickened swiftly  and the shadows under the dark arch fled  the monstrous
watchers sat there cold and still  revealed in all their hideous shape  for a
moment sam caught a glitter in the black stones of their eyes  the very malice
of which made him quail  but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into
fear 
he sprang past them  but even as he did so  thrusting the phial back into his
bosom  he was aware  as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to behind him 
that their vigilance was renewed  and from those evil heads there came a high
shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him  far up above  like an
answering signal  a harsh bell clanged a single stroke 


‘that’s done it ’ said sam  `now i’ve rung the front-door bell  well 
come on somebody ’ he cried  `tell captain shagrat that the great elf-warrior
has called  with his elf-sword too ’
there was no answer  sam strode forward  sting glittered blue in his hand 
the courtyard lay in deep shadow  but he could see that the pavement was strewn
with bodies  right at his feet were two orc-archers with knives sticking in
their backs  beyond lay many more shapes  some singly as they had been hewn down
or shot  others in pairs  still grappling one another  dead in the very throes
of stabbing  throttling  biting  the stones were slippery with dark blood 
two liveries sam noticed  one marked by the red eye  the other by a moon
disfigured with a ghastly face of death  but he did not stop to look more
closely  across the court a great door at the foot of the tower stood half open 
and a red light came through  a large orc lay dead upon the threshold  sam
sprang over the body and went in  and then he peered about at a loss 
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain-side 
it was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the walls  but its distant
end was lost in gloom  many doors and openings could be seen on this side and
that  but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor 
from what he had heard of the captains’ talk sam knew that  dead or alive 
frodo would most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above 
but he might search for a day before he found the way 
‘it’ll be near the back  i guess ’ sam muttered  `the whole tower
climbs backwards-like  and anyway i’d better follow these lights ’
he advanced down the passage  but slowly now  each step more reluctant 
terror was beginning to grip him again  there was no sound save the rap of his
feet  which seemed to grow to an echoing noise  like the slapping of great hands
upon the stones  the dead bodies  the emptiness  the dank black walls that in
the torchlight seemed to drip with blood  the fear of sudden death lurking in
doorway or shadow  and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the
gate  it was almost more than he could screw himself to face  he would have
welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time - rather than this hideous
brooding uncertainty  he forced himself to think of frodo  lying bound or in
pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place  he went on 
he had passed beyond the torchlight  almost to a great arched door at the end
of the passage  the inner side of the under gate  as he rightly guessed  when
there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek  he stopped short  then he
heard feet coming  someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway
overhead 
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand  it dragged at the chain
and clutched the ring  but sam did not put it on  for even as he clasped it to
his breast  an orc came clattering down  leaping out of a dark opening at the
right  it ran towards him  it was no more than six paces from him when  lifting
its head  it saw him  and sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in
its bloodshot eyes  it stopped short aghast  for what it saw was not a small
frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword  it saw a great silent shape 
cloaked in a grey shadow  looming against the wavering light behind  in one hand
it held a sword  the very light of which was a bitter pain  the other was
clutched at its breast  but held concealed some nameless menace of power and
doom 
for a moment the orc crouched  and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned
and fled back as it had come  never was any dog more heartened when its enemy
turned tail than sam at this unexpected flight  with a shout he gave chase 
`yes  the elf-warrior is loose ’ he cried  ‘i’m coming  just you show
me the way up  or i’ll skin you ’
but the orc was in its own haunts  nimble and well-fed  sam was a stranger 
hungry and weary  the stairs were high and steep and winding  sam’s breath
began to come in gasps  the orc had soon passed out of sight  and now only
faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on and up  every now
and again it gave a yell  and the echo ran along the walls  but slowly all sound
of it died away 
sam plodded on  he felt that he was on the right road  and his spirits had
risen a good deal  he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt  `well 
well ’ he said  `if only they all take such a dislike to me and my sting  this
may turn out better than i hoped  and anyway it looks as if shagrat  gorbag  and
company have done nearly all my job for me  except for that little frightened
rat  i do believe there’s nobody left alive in the place ’
and with that he stopped  brought up hard  as if he had hit his head against
the stone wall  the full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow 
nobody left alive  whose had been that horrible dying shriek  `frodo  frodo 
master ’ he cried half sobbing  ‘if they’ve killed you  what shall i do 
well  i’m coming at last  right to the top  to see what i must ’


up  up he went  it was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a turn  or
beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the tower  sam tried to
count the steps  but after two hundred he lost his reckoning  he was moving
quietly now  for he thought that he could hear the sound of voices talking 
still some way above  more than one rat remained alive  it seemed 
all at once  when he felt that he could pump out no more breath  nor force
his knees to bend again  the stair ended  he stood still  the voices were now
loud and near  sam peered about  he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third and highest tier of the tower  an open space  about twenty yards across 
with a low parapet  there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the
midst of the roof  with low doors facing east and west  eastward sam could see
the plain of mordor vast and dark below  and the burning mountain far away  a
fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells  and the rivers of fire blazed so
fiercely that even at this distance of many miles the light of them lit the
tower-top with a red glare  westward the view was blocked by the base of the
great turret that stood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high
above the crest of the encircling hills  light gleamed in a window-slit  its
door was not ten yards from where sam stood  it was open but dark  and from just
within its shadow the voices came 
at first sam did not listen  he took a pace out of the eastward door and
looked about  at once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest  all
the court was choked with dead orcs or their severed and scattered heads and
limbs  the place stank of death  a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent him
darting back into hiding  an orc-voice rose in anger  and he knew it again at
once  harsh  brutal  cold  it was shagrat speaking  captain of the tower 
`you won’t go again  you say  curse you  snaga  you little maggot  if you
think i’m so damaged that it’s safe to flout me  you’re mistaken come
here  and i’ll squeeze your eyes out  like i did to radbug just now  and when
some new lads come  i’ll deal with you  i’ll send you to shelob ’
`they won’t come  not before you’re dead anyway ’ answered snaga
surlily  ‘i’ve told you twice that gorbag’s swine got to the gate first 
and none of ours got out  lagduf and muzgash ran through  but they were shot  i
saw it from a window  i tell you  and they were the last ’
‘then you must go  i must stay here anyway  but i’m hurt  the black pits
take that filthy rebel gorbag ’ shagrat’s voice trailed off into a
string of foul names and curses  `i gave him better than i got  but he knifed
me  the dung  before i throttled him  you must go  or i’ll eat you  news must
get through to lugbúrz  or we’ll both be for the black pits  yes  you
too  you won’t escape by skulking here ’
`i’m not going down those stairs again ’ growled snaga  `be you captain
or no  nar  keep your hands off your knife  or i’ll put an arrow in your guts 
you won’t be a captain long when they hear about all these goings-on  i’ve
fought for the tower against those stinking morgul-rats  but a nice mess you two
precious captains have made of things  fighting over the swag ’
‘that’s enough from you ’ snarled shagrat  `i had my orders  it was
gorbag started it  trying to pinch that pretty shirt ’
`well  you put his back up  being so high and mighty  and he had more sense
than you anyway  he told you more than once that the most dangerous of these
spies was still loose  and you wouldn’t listen  and you won’t listen now 
gorbag was right  i tell you  there’s a great fighter about  one of those
bloody-handed elves  or one of the filthy tarks 1 he’s coming here  i
tell you  you heard the bell  he’s got past the watchers  and that’s tark’s
work  he’s on the stairs  and until he’s off them  i’m not going down 
not if you were a nazgûl  i wouldn’t ’
`so that’s it  is it ’ yelled shagrat  ‘you’ll do this  and you’ll
not do that  and when he does come  you’ll bolt and leave me  no  you won’t 
i’ll put red maggot-holes in your belly first ’
out of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying  behind him came shagrat 
a large orc with long arms that  as he ran crouching  reached to the ground  but
one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding  the other hugged a large black
bundle  in the red glare sam  cowering behind the stair-door  caught a glimpse
of his evil face as it passed  it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared
with blood  slaver dripped from its protruding fangs  the mouth snarled like an
animal 
as far as sam could see  shagrat hunted snaga round the roof  until ducking
and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and
disappeared  then shagrat halted  out of the eastward door sam could see him now
by the parapet  panting  his left claw clenching and unclenching feebly  he put
the bundle on the floor and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and
spat on it  going to the parapet he leaned over  looking down into the outer
court far below  twice he shouted but no answer came 
suddenly  as shagrat was stooped over the battlement  his back to the
roof-top  sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was moving 
it was crawling  it put out a claw and clutched the bundle  it staggered up  in
its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short broken haft  it was
poised for a stabbing thrust  but at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth 
a gasp of pain or hate  quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside  twisted round 
and drove his knife into his enemy’s throat 
`got you  gorbag ’ he cried  ‘not quite dead  eh  well  i’ll finish my
job now ’ he sprang on to the fallen body  and stamped and trampled it in his
fury  stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife  satisfied at
last  he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph 
then he licked his knife  and put it between his teeth  and catching up the
bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs 
sam had no time to think  he might have slipped out of the other door  but
hardly without being seen  and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this
hideous orc for long  he did what was probably the best thing he could have
done  he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout  he was no longer holding the
ring  but it was there  a hidden power  a cowing menace to the slaves of mordor 
and in his hand was sting  and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the
glitter of cruel stars in the terrible elf-countries  the dream of which was a
cold fear to all his kind  and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his
treasure  he stopped  growling  baring his fangs  then once more  orc-fashion 
he leapt aside  and as sam sprang at him  using the heavy bundle as both shield
and weapon  he thrust it hard into his enemy’s face  sam staggered  and before
he could recover  shagrat darted past and down the stairs 
sam ran after him  cursing  but he did not go far  soon the thought of frodo
returned to him  and he remembered that the other orc had gone back into the
turret  here was another dreadful choice  and he had no time to ponder it  if
shagrat got away  he would soon get help and come back  but if sam pursued him 
the other orc might do some horrible deed up there  and anyway sam might miss
shagrat or be killed by him  he turned quickly and ran back up the stairs 
`wrong again  i expect ’ he sighed  `but it’s my job to go right up to the
top first  whatever happens afterwards ’
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and
through the gate  bearing his precious burden  if sam could have seen him and
known the grief that his escape would bring  he might have quailed  but now his
mind was set on the last stage of his search  he came cautiously to the
turret-door and stepped inside  it opened into darkness  but soon his staring
eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand  it came from an opening that
led to another stairway  dark and narrow  it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outer wall  a torch was glimmering from
somewhere up above 
softly sam began to climb  he came to the guttering torch  fixed above a door
on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward  one of the red eyes
that he and frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel’s mouth  quickly sam
passed the door and hurried on to the second storey  dreading at any moment to
he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind  he came
next to a window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage
through the middle of the turret  the door was open  the passage dark save for
the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the
window-slit  but here the stair stopped and climbed no further  sam crept into
the passage  on either side there was a low door  both were closed and locked 
there was no sound at all 
`a dead end ’ muttered sam  `and after all my climb  this can’t be the
top of the tower  but what can i do now ’
he ran back to the lower storey and tried the door  it would not move  he ran
up again  and sweat began to trickle down his face  he felt that even minutes
were precious  but one by one they escaped  and he could do nothing  he cared no
longer for shagrat or snaga or any other orc that was ever spawned  he longed
only for his master  for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand 
at last  weary and feeling finally defeated  he sat on a step below the level
of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands  it was quiet  horribly
quiet  the torch  that was already burning low when he arrived  sputtered and
went out  and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide  and then softly  to
his own surprise  there at the vain end of his long journey and his grief  moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell  sam began to sing 
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower  the voice of a
forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the
clear song of an elven-lord  he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire 
and snatches of mr  bilbo’s rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting
glimpses of the country of his home  and then suddenly new strength rose in him 
and his voice rang out  while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple
tune 
in western lands beneath the sun

the flowers may rise in spring 

the trees may bud  the waters run 

the merry finches sing 

or there maybe ‘tis cloudless night

and swaying beeches bear

the elven-stars as jewels white

amid their branching hair 



though here at journey’s end i lie

in darkness buried deep 

beyond all towers strong and high 

beyond all mountains steep 

above all shadows rides the sun

and stars for ever dwell 

i will not say the day is done 

nor bid the stars farewell 
`beyond all towers strong and high ’ he began again  and then he stopped
short  he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him  but now he
could hear nothing  yes  he could hear something  but not a voice  footsteps
were approaching  now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above  the
hinges creaked  sam crouched down listening  the door closed with a dull thud 
and then a snarling orc-voice rang out 
‘ho la  you up there  you dunghill rat  stop your squeaking  or i’ll come
and deal with you  d’you hear ’
there was no answer 
‘all right ’ growled snaga  `but i’ll come and have a look at you all
the same  and see what you’re up to ’
the hinges creaked again  and sam  now peering over the corner of the
passage-threshold  saw a flicker of light in an open doorway  and the dim shape
of an orc coming out  he seemed to be carrying a ladder  suddenly the answer
dawned on sam  the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in the roof of the
passage  snaga thrust the ladder upwards  steadied it  and then clambered out of
sight  sam heard a bolt drawn back  then he heard the hideous voice speaking
again 
`you lie quiet  or you’ll pay for it  you’ve not got long to live in
peace  i guess  but if you don’t want the fun to begin right now  keep your
trap shut  see  there’s a reminder for you ’ there was a sound like the
crack of a whip 
at that rage blazed in sam’s heart to a sudden fury  he sprang up  ran  and
went up the ladder like a cat  his head came out in the middle of the floor of a
large round chamber  a red lamp hung from its roof  the westward window-slit was
high and dark  something was lying on the floor by the wall under the window 
but over it a black orc-shape was straddled  it raised a whip a second time  but
the blow never fell 
with a cry sam leapt across the floor  sting in hand  the orc wheeled round 
but before it could make a move sam slashed its whip-hand from its arm  howling
with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down at him  sam’s next
blow went wide  and thrown off his balance he fell backwards  clutching at the
orc as it stumbled over him  before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a
thud  the orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen
through the open trap-door  sam gave no more thought to it  he ran to the figure
huddled on the floor  it was frodo 


he was naked  lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags  his arm was flung
up  shielding his head  and across his side there ran an ugly whip-weal 
`frodo  mr  frodo  my dear ’ cried sam  tears almost blinding him  `it’s
sam  i’ve come ’ he half lifted his master and hugged him to his breast 
frodo opened his eyes 
`am i still dreaming ’ he muttered  `but the other dreams were horrible ’
`you’re not dreaming at all  master ’ said sam  `it’s real  it’s me 
i’ve come ’
`i can hardly believe it ’ said frodo  clutching him  `there was an orc
with a whip  and then it turns into sam  then i wasn’t dreaming after all when
i heard that singing down below  and i tried to answer  was it you ’
‘it was indeed  mr  frodo  i’d given up hope  almost  i couldn’t find
you 
well  you have now  sam  dear sam  said frodo  and he la back in sam’s
gentle arms  closing his eyes  like a child at rest when night-fears are driven
away by some loved voice or hand 
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness  but it was not
allowed  it was not enough for him to find his master  he had still to try and
save him  he kissed frodo’s forehead  `come  wake up mr  frodo ’ he said 
trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains at bag end
on a summer’s morning 
frodo sighed and sat up  `where are we  how did i get here ’ he asked 
‘there’s no time for tales till we get somewhere else  mr  frodo ’ said
sam  `but you’re in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by the
tunnel before the orcs got you  how long ago that was i don’t know  more than
a day  i guess ’
`only that ’ said frodo  `it seems weeks  you must tell me all about it  if
we get a chance  something hit me  didn’t it  and i fell into darkness and
foul dreams  and woke and found that waking was worse  orcs were all round me  i
think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat  my
head grew clear  but i was aching and weary  they stripped me of everything  and
then two great brutes came and questioned me  questioned me until i thought i
should go mad  standing over me  gloating  fingering their knives  i’ll never
forget their claws and eyes ’
`you won’t  if you talk about them  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘and if we
don’t want to see them again  the sooner we get going the better  can you
walk ’
`yes  i can walk ’ said frodo  getting up slowly  ‘i am not hurt sam 
only i feel very tired  and i’ve a pain here ’ he put his hand to the back
of his neck above his left shoulder  he stood up  and it looked to sam as if he
was clothed in flame  his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp above 
twice he paced across the floor 
`that’s better ’ he said  his spirits rising a little  `i didn’t dare
to move when i was left alone  or one of the guards came  until the yelling and
fighting began  the two big brutes  they quarrelled  i think  over me and my
things  i lay here terrified  and then all went deadly quiet  and that was
worse ’
`yes  they quarrelled  seemingly ’ said sam  ‘there must have been a
couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place  a bit of a tall order
for sam gamgee  as you might say  but they’ve done all the killing of
themselves  that’s lucky  but it’s too long to make a song about  till
we’re out of here  now what’s to be done  you can’t go walking in the
black land in naught but your skin  mr  frodo ’
`they’ve taken everything  sam ’ said frodo  `everything i had  do you
understand  everything ’ he cowered on the floor again with bowed head 
as his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster  and despair
overwhelmed him  ‘the quest has failed sam  even if we get out of here  we
can’t escape  only elves can escape  away  away out of middle-earth  far away
over the sea  if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out ’
`no  not everything  mr  frodo  and it hasn’t failed  not yet  i
took it  mr  frodo  begging your pardon  and i’ve kept it safe  it’s round
my neck now  and a terrible burden it is  too ’ sam fumbled for the ring and
its chain  `but i suppose you must take it back ’ now it had come to it  sam
felt reluctant to give up the ring and burden his master with it again 
`you’ve got it ’ gasped frodo  `you’ve got it here  sam  you’re a
marvel ’ then quickly and strangely his tone changed  `give it to me ’ he
cried  standing up  holding out a trembling hand  `give it me at once  you
can’t have it ’
‘all right  mr  frodo ’ said sam  rather startled  ‘here it is ’
slowly he drew the ring out and passed the chain over his head  `but you’re in
the land of mordor now  sir  and when you get out  you’ll see the fiery
mountain and all  you’ll find the ring very dangerous now  and very hard to
bear  if it’s too hard a job  i could share it with you  maybe ’
`no  no ’ cried frodo  snatching the ring and chain from sam’s hands  `no
you won’t  you thief ’ he panted  staring at sam with eyes wide with fear
and enmity  then suddenly  clasping the ring in one clenched fist  he stood
aghast  a mist seemed to clear from his eyes  and he passed a hand over his
aching brow  the hideous vision had seemed so real to him  half bemused as he
was still with wound and fear  sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
again  leering and pawing at his treasure  a foul little creature with greedy
eyes and slobbering mouth  but now the vision had passed  there was sam kneeling
before him  his face wrung with pain  as if he had been stabbed in the heart 
tears welled from his eyes 
‘o sam ’ cried frodo  `what have i said  what have i done  forgive me 
after all you have done  it is the horrible power of the ring  i wish it had
never  never  been found  but don’t mind me  sam  i must carry the burden to
the end  it can’t be altered  you can’t come between me and this doom ’
‘that’s all right  mr  frodo ’ said sam  rubbing his sleeve across his
eyes  `i understand  but i can still help  can’t i  i’ve got to get you out
of here  at once  see  but first you want some clothes and gear and then some
food  the clothes will be the easiest part  as we’re in mordor  we’d  best
dress up mordor-fashion  and anyway there isn’t no choice  it’ll have to be
orc-stuff for you  mr  frodo  i’m afraid  and for me too  if we go together 
we’d best match  now put this round you ’
sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about frodo’s shoulders  then
unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor  he drew sting from its sheath 
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade  `i was forgetting this  mr 
frodo ’ he said  `no  they didn’t get everything  you lent me sting  if you
remember  and the lady’s glass  i’ve got them both still  but lend them to
me a little longer  mr  frodo  i must go and see what i can find  you stay here 
walk about a bit and ease your legs  i shan’t be long  i shan’t have to go
far ’
`take care  sam ’ said frodo  `and be quick  there may be orcs still alive 
lurking in wait ’
‘i’ve got to chance it ’ said sam  he stepped to the trap-door and
slipped down the ladder  in a minute his head reappeared  he threw a long knife
on the floor 
`there’s something that might be useful ’ he said  ‘he’s dead  the
one that whipped you  broke his neck  it seems  in his hurry  now you draw up
the ladder  if you can  mr  frodo  and don’t you let it down till you hear me
call the password  elbereth i’ll call  what the elves say  no orc would
say that ’


frodo sat for a while and shivered  dreadful fears chasing one another through
his mind  then he got up  drew the grey elven-cloak about him  and to keep his
mind occupied  began to walk to and fro  prying and peering into every corner of
his prison 
it was not very long  though fear made it seem an hour at least  before he
heard sam’s voice calling softly from below  elbereth  elbereth  frodo
let down the light ladder  up came sam  puffing  heaving a great bundle on his
head  he let it fall with a thud 
`quick now  mr  frodo ’ he said  `i’ve had a bit of a search to find
anything small enough for the likes of us  we’ll have to make do  but we must
hurry  i’ve met nothing alive  and i’ve seen nothing but i’m not easy  i
think this place is being watched  i can’t explain it  but well  it feels to
me as if one of those foul flying riders was about  up in the blackness where he
can’t be seen ’
he opened the bundle  frodo looked in disgust at the contents  but there was
nothing for it  he had to put the things on  or go naked  there were long hairy
breeches of some unclean beast-fell  and a tunic of dirty leather  he drew them
on  over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail  short for a full-sized orc 
too long for frodo and heavy  about it he clasped a belt  at which there hung a
short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword  sam had brought several
orc-helmets  one of them fitted frodo well enough  a black cap with iron rim 
and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil eye was painted in red
above the beaklike nose-guard 
`the morgul-stuff  gorbag’s gear  was a better fit and better made ’ said
sam  `but it wouldn’t do  i guess  to go carrying his tokens into mordor  not
after this business here  well  there you are  mr  frodo  a perfect little orc 
if i may make so bold-at least you would be  if we could cover your face with a
mask  give you longer arms  and make you bow-legged  this will hide some of the
tell-tales ’ he put a large black cloak round frodo’s shoulders  `now
you’re ready  you can pick up a shield as we go ’
‘what about you  sam ’ said frodo  `aren’t we going to match ’
`well  mr  frodo  i’ve been thinking ’ said sam  ‘i’d best not leave
any of my stuff behind  and we can’t destroy it  and i can’t wear orc-mail
over all my clothes  can i  i’ll just have to cover up ’
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak  it went into a
surprisingly small roll  this he put into his pack that lay on the floor 
standing up  he slung it behind his back  put an orc-helm on his head  and cast
another black cloak about his shoulders  `there ’ he said  `now we match  near
enough  and now we must be off ’
‘i can’t go all the way at a run  sam ’ said frodo with a wry smile 
‘i hope you’ve made inquiries about inns along the road  or have you
forgotten about food and drink ’
`save me  but so i had ’ said sam  he whistled in dismay  ‘bless me  mr 
frodo  but you’ve gone and made me that hungry and thirsty  i don’t know
when drop or morsel last passed my lips  i’d forgotten it  trying to find you 
but let me think  last time i looked i’d got about enough of that waybread 
and of what captain faramir gave us  to keep me on my legs for a couple of weeks
at a pinch  but if there’s a drop left in my bottle  there’s no more 
that’s not going to be enough for two  nohow  don’t ores eat  and don’t
they drink  or do they just live on foul air and poison ’
`no  they eat and drink  sam  the shadow that bred them can only mock  it
cannot make  not real new things of its own  i don’t think it gave life to the
ores  it only ruined them and twisted them  and if they are to live at all  they
have to live like other living creatures  foul waters and foul meats they’ll
take  if they can get no better  but not poison  they’ve fed me  and so i’m
better off than you  there must be food and water somewhere in this place ’
`but there’s no time to look for them ’ said sam 
`well  things are a bit better than you think ’ said frodo  ‘i have had a
bit of luck while you were away  indeed they did not take everything  i’ve
found my food-bag among some rags on the floor  they’ve rummaged it  of
course  but i guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas 
worse than gollum did  it’s scattered about and some of it is trampled and
broken  but i’ve gathered it together  it’s not far short of what you’ve
got  but they’ve taken faramir’s food  and they’ve slashed up my
water-bottle ’
`well  there’s no more to be said ’ said sam  `we’ve got enough to
start on  but the water’s going to be a bad business  but come mr  frodo  off
we go  or a whole lake of it won’t do us any good ’
‘not till you’ve had a mouthful  sam ’ said frodo  `i won’t budge 
here  take this elven-cake  and drink that last drop in your bottle  the whole
thing is quite hopeless  so it’s no good worrying about tomorrow  it probably
won’t come ’


at last they started  down the ladder they climbed  and then sam took it and
laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc  the stair was
dark  but on the roof-top the glare of the mountain could still be seen  though
it was dying down now to a sullen red  they picked up two shields to complete
their disguise and then went on 
down the great stairway they plodded  the high chamber of the turret behind 
where they had met again  seemed almost homely  they were out in the open again
now  and terror ran along the walls  all might be dead in the tower of cirith
ungol  but it was steeped in fear and evil still 
at length they came to the door upon the outer court  and they halted  even
from where they stood they felt the malice of the watchers beating on them 
black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare of mordor
dimly showed  as they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of the ores
each step became more difficult  before they even reached the archway they were
brought to a stand  to move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and
limb 
frodo had no strength for such a battle  he sank to the ground  `i can’t go
on  sam ’ he murmured  `i’m going to faint  i don’t know what’s come
over me ’
`i do  mr  frodo  hold up now  it’s the gate  there’s some devilry there 
but i got through  and i’m going to get out  it can’t be more dangerous than
before  now for it ’
sam drew out the elven-glass of galadriel again  as if to do honour to his
hardihood  and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had
done such deeds  the phial blazed forth suddenly  so that all the shadowy court
was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning  but it remained steady and did
not pass 
‘gilthoniel  a elbereth ’ sam cried  for  why he did not know  his
thought sprang back suddenly to the elves in the shire  and the song that drove
away the black rider in the trees 
‘aiya elenion ancalima ’ cried frodo once again behind him 
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a
cord  and frodo and sam stumbled forward  then they ran  through the gate and
past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes  there was a crack  the
keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels  and the wall above crumbled 
and fell in ruin  only by a hair did they escape  a bell clanged  and from the
watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail  far up above in the darkness it
was answered  out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged
shape  rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek 
 
sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast 
‘run  mr  frodo ’ he cried  ‘no  not that way  there’s a sheer drop over
the wall  follow me ’
down the road from the gate they fled  in fifty paces  with a swift bend
round a jutting bastion of the cliff  it took them out of sight from the tower 
they had escaped for the moment  cowering back against the rock they drew
breath  and then they clutched at their hearts  perching now on the wall beside
the ruined gate the nazgûl sent out its deadly cries  all the cliffs
echoed 
in terror they stumbled on  soon the road bent sharply eastward again and
exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the tower  as they flitted
across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement  then
they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join
the morgul-road  they came to the way-meeting  there was still no sign of orcs 
nor of an answer to the cry of the nazgûl 
but they knew that the silence would not last long  at any moment now the hunt
would begin 
‘this won’t do  sam ’ said frodo  ‘if we were real orcs  we ought to
be dashing back to the tower  not running away  the first enemy we meet will
know us  we must get off this road somehow ’
‘but we can’t ’ said sam  ‘not without wings ’
the eastern faces of the ephel dúath were sheer  falling in cliff and
precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge  a short
way beyond the way-meeting  after another steep incline  a flying bridge
of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbled slopes
and glens of the morgai  with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge  but they had hardly reached its further end when they heard the hue and
cry begin  away behind them  now high above on the mountain-side  loomed the
tower of cirith ungol  its stones glowing dully  suddenly its harsh bell clanged
again  and then broke into a shattering peal  horns sounded  and now from beyond
the bridge-end came answering cries  down in the dark trough  cut off from the
dying glare of orodruin  frodo and sam could not see ahead  but already they
heard the tramp of iron-shod feet  and upon the road there rang the swift
clatter of hoofs 
‘quick  sam  over we go ’ cried frodo  they scrambled on to the low
parapet of the bridge  fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into
the gulf  for the slopes of the morgai had already risen almost to the level of
the road  but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall 
‘well  here goes  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘good-bye ’
he let go  frodo followed  and even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind 
but sam would have laughed  if he had dared  half fearing a breaking plunge down
on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed  in a drop of no more than a dozen feet 
with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected  a tangle of
thorny bushes  there sam lay still  softly sucking a scratched hand 
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper  ‘bless
me  mr  frodo  but i didn’t know as anything grew in mordor  but if i had
a’known  this is just what i’d have looked for  these thorns must be a foot
long by the feel of them  they’ve stuck through everything i’ve got on  wish
i’d a’put that mail-shirt on ’
‘orc-mail doesn’t keep these thorns out ’ said frodo  ‘not even a
leather jerkin is any good ’
they had a struggle to get out of the thicket  the thorns and briars were as
tough as wire and as clinging as claws  their cloaks were rent and tattered
before they broke free at last 
‘now down we go  sam ’ frodo whispered  ‘down into the valley quick 
and then turn northward  as soon as ever we can ’
day was coming again in the world outside  and far beyond the glooms of
mordor the sun was climbing over the eastern rim of middle-earth  but here all
was still dark as night  the mountain smouldered and its fires went out  the
glare faded from the cliffs  the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since
they left ithilien now seemed dead  slowly and painfully they clambered down 
groping  stumbling  scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind
shadows  down and down until they could go no further 
at length they stopped  and sat side by side  their backs against a boulder 
both were sweating  ‘if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of water 
i’d shake his hand ’ said sam 
‘don’t say such things ’ said frodo  ‘it only makes it worse ’ then
he stretched himself out  dizzy and weary  and he spoke no more for a while  at
last with a struggle he got up again  to his amazement he found that sam was
asleep  ‘wake up  sam ’ he said  ‘come on  it’s time we made another
effort ’
sam scrambled to his feet  ‘well i never ’ he said  ‘i must have
dropped off  it’s a long time  mr  frodo  since i had a proper sleep  and my
eyes just closed down on their own ’
frodo now led the way  northward as near as he could guess  among the stones
and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine  but presently he
stopped again 
‘it’s no good  sam ’ he said  ‘i can’t manage it  this mail-shirt 
i mean  not in my present state  even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when i was
tired  this is far heavier  and what’s the use of it  we shan’t win through
by fighting ’
‘but we may have some to do ’ said sam  ‘and there’s knives and stray
arrows  that gollum isn’t dead  for one thing  i don’t like to think of you
with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark ’
‘look here  sam dear lad ’ said frodo  ‘i am tired  weary  i haven’t
a hope left  but i have to go on trying to get to the mountain  as long as i can
move  the ring is enough  this extra weight is killing me  it must go  but
don’t think i’m ungrateful  i hate to think of the foul work you must have
had among the bodies to find it for me ’
‘don’t talk about it  mr  frodo  bless you  i’d carry you on my back 
if i could  let it go then ’
frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away  he
shivered a little  ‘what i really need is something warm ’ he said 
‘it’s gone cold  or else i’ve caught a chill ’
‘you can have my cloak  mr  frodo ’ said sam  he unslung his pack and
took out the elven-cloak  ‘how’s this  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘you wrap
that orc-rag close round you  and put the belt outside it  then this can go over
all  it don’t look quite orc-fashion  but it’ll keep you warmer  and i
daresay it’ll keep you from harm better than any other gear  it was made by
the lady ’
frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch  ‘that’s better ’ he said 
‘i feel much lighter  i can go on now  but this blind dark seems to be getting
into my heart  as i lay in prison  sam  i tried to remember the brandywine  and
woody end  and the water running through the mill at hobbiton  but i can’t see
them now ’
‘there now  mr  frodo  it’s you that’s talking of water this time ’
said sam  ‘if only the lady could see us or hear us  i’d say to her  “your
ladyship  all we want is light and water  just clean water and plain daylight 
better than any jewels  begging your pardon ” but
it’s a long way to lórien ’ sam sighed and waved his hand towards the
heights of the ephel dúath  now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness
against the black sky 


they started off again  they had not gone far when frodo paused  ‘there’s a
black rider over us ’ he said  ‘i can feel it  we had better keep still for
a while ’
crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did not
speak for some time  then frodo breathed a sigh of relief  ‘it’s passed ’
he said  they stood up  and then they both stared in wonder  away to their left 
southward  against a sky that was turning grey  the peaks and high ridges of the
great range began to appear dark and black  visible shapes  light was growing
behind them  slowly it crept towards the north  there was battle far above in
the high spaces of the air  the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven
back  their edges tattering as a wind out of the living world came up and swept
the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home  under the lifting
skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into mordor like pale morning
through the grimed window of a prison 
‘look at it  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘look at it  the wind’s changed 
something’s happening  he’s not having it all his own way  his darkness is
breaking up out in the world there  i wish i could see what is going on ’
it was the morning of the fifteenth of march  and over the vale of anduin the
sun was rising above the eastern shadow  and the
south-west wind was blowing  théoden lay dying on the pelennor fields 
as frodo and sam stood and gazed  the rim of light spread all along the line
of the ephel dúath  and then they saw a shape  moving at a great speed
out of the west  at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above
the mountain-tops  but growing  until it plunged like a bolt into the dark
canopy and passed high above them  as it went it sent out a long shrill cry  the
voice of a nazgûl  but this cry no longer held any terror for them 
it was a cry of woe and dismay  ill tidings for the dark tower  the lord of the
ring-wraiths had met his doom 
‘what did i tell you  something’s happening ’ cried sam ’ “the
war’s going well ” said shagrat  but gorbag he wasn’t so sure  and he was
right there too  things are looking up  mr  frodo  haven’t you got some hope
now ’
‘well no  not much  sam ’ frodo sighed  ‘that’s away beyond the
mountains  we’re going east not west  and i’m so tired  and the ring is so
heavy  sam  and i begin to see it in my mind all the time  like a great wheel of
fire ’
sam’s quick spirits sank again at once  he looked at his master anxiously 
and he took his hand  ‘come  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘i’ve got one thing i
wanted  a bit of light  enough to help us  and yet i guess it’s dangerous too 
try a bit further  and then we’ll lie close and have a rest  but take a morsel
to eat now  a bit of the elves’ food  it may hearten you ’
sharing a wafer of lembas  and munching it as best they could with
their parched mouths  frodo and sam plodded on  the light  though no more than a
grey dusk  was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley
between the mountains  it sloped up gently northward  and at its bottom went the
bed of a now dry and withered stream  beyond its stony course they saw a beaten
path that wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs  had they known 
they could have reached it quicker  for it was a track that left the main
morgul-road at the western bridge-end and went down by a long stair cut in the
rock to the valley’s bottom  it was used by patrols or by messengers going
swiftly to lesser posts and strongholds north-away  between cirith ungol and the
narrows of isenmouthe  the iron jaws of carach angren 
it was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path  but they needed speed 
and frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai  and he judged that northward was 
maybe  the way that their hunters would least expect them to take  the road east
to the plain  or the pass back westward  those they would first search most
thoroughly  only when he was well north of the tower did he mean to turn and
seek for some way to take him east  east on the last desperate stage of his
journey  so now they crossed the stony bed and took to the orc-path  and for
some time they marched along it  the cliffs at their left were overhung  and
they could not be seen from above  but the path made many bends  and at each
bend they gripped their sword-hilts and went forward cautiously 
the light grew no stronger  for orodruin was still belching forth a great
fume that  beaten upwards by the opposing airs  mounted higher and higher  until
it reached a region above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof  whose
central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view  they had trudged for
more than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to a halt 
unbelievable  but unmistakable  water trickling  out of a gully on the left  so
sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some
huge axe  water came dripping down  the last remains  maybe  of some sweet rain
gathered from sunlit seas  but ill-fated to fall at last upon the walls of the
black land and wander fruitless down into the dust  here it came out of the rock
in a little falling streamlet  and flowed across the path  and turning south ran
away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones 
sam sprang towards it  ‘if ever i see the lady again  i will tell her ’
he cried  ‘light and now water ’ then he stopped  ‘let me drink first mr 
frodo ’ he said 
‘all right  but there’s room enough for two ’
‘i didn’t mean that ’ said sam  ‘i mean  if it’s poisonous  or
something that will show its badness quick  well  better me than you  master  if
you understand me ’
‘i do  but i think we’ll trust our luck together  sam  or our blessing 
still  be careful now  if it’s very cold ’
the water was cool but not icy  and it had an unpleasant taste  at once
bitter and oily  or so they would have said at home  here it seemed beyond all
praise  and beyond fear or prudence  they drank their fill  and sam replenished
his water-bottle  after that frodo felt easier  and they went on for several
miles  until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall along
its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another orc-hold 
‘this is where we turn aside  sam ’ said frodo  ‘and we must turn
east ’ he sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley  ‘i
have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there  and then i
must rest a little ’
the river-bed was now some way below the path  they scrambled down to it  and
began to cross it  to their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by threads of
water trickling down from some source higher up the valley  upon its outer
marges under the westward mountains mordor was a dying land  but it was not yet
dead  and here things still grew  harsh  twisted  bitter  struggling for life 
in the glens of the morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees
lurked and clung  coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the stones  and
withered mosses crawled on them  and everywhere great writhing  tangled brambles
sprawled  some had long stabbing thorns  some hooked barbs that rent like
knives  the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them  grating and
rattling in the sad airs  but their maggot-ridden buds were only just opening 
flies  dun or grey  or black  marked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch 
buzzed and stung  and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced
and reeled 
‘orc-gear’s no good ’ said sam  waving his arms  ‘i wish i’d got an
orc’s hide ’
at last frodo could go no further  they had climbed up a narrow shelving
ravine  but they still had a long way to go before they could even come in sight
of the last craggy ridge  ‘i must rest now  sam  and sleep if i can ’ said
frodo  he looked about  but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl
into in this dismal country  at length  tired out  they slunk under a curtain of
brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock-face 
there they sat and made such a meal as they could  keeping back the precious lembas
for the evil days ahead  they ate the half of what remained in sam’s bag of
faramir’s provision  some dried fruit  and a small slip of cured meat  and
they sipped some water  they had drunk again from the pools in the valley  but
they were very  thirsty again  there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that
dried the mouth  when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed 
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross 
‘now you go to sleep first  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘it’s getting dark
again  i reckon this day is nearly over ’
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken  sam
struggled with his own weariness  and he took frodo’s hand  and there he sat
silent till deep night fell  then at last  to keep himself awake  he crawled
from the hiding-place and looked out  the land
seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises  but there was no sound of
voice or of foot  far above the ephel dúath in the west the night-sky was
still dim and pale  there  peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor
high up in the mountains  sam saw a white star twinkle for a while  the beauty
of it smote his heart  as he looked up out of the forsaken land  and hope
returned to him  for like a shaft  clear and cold  the thought pierced him that
in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing  there was light and
high beauty for ever beyond its reach  his song in the tower had been defiance
rather than hope  for then he was thinking of himself  now  for a moment  his
own fate  and even his masters  ceased to trouble him  he crawled back into the
brambles and laid himself by frodo’s side  and putting away all fear he cast
himself into a deep untroubled sleep 
they woke together  hand in hand  sam was almost fresh  ready for another
day  but frodo sighed  his sleep had been uneasy  full of dreams of fire  and
waking brought him no comfort  still his sleep had not been without all healing
virtue  he was stronger  more able to bear his burden one stage further  they
did not know the time  nor how long they had slept  but after a morsel of food
and a sip of water they went on up the ravine  until it ended in a sharp slope
of screes and sliding stones  there the last living things gave up their
struggle  the tops of the morgai were grassless  bare  jagged  barren as a
slate 
after much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb  and
with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were up  they came to a cleft
between two dark crags  and passing through found themselves on the very edge of
the last fence of mordor  below them  at the bottom of a fall of some fifteen
hundred feet  lay the inner plain stretching away into a formless gloom beyond
their sight  the wind of the world blew now from the west  and the great clouds
were lifted high  floating away eastward  but still only a grey light came to
the dreary fields of gorgoroth  there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in
hollows  and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth 
still far away  forty miles at least  they saw mount doom  its feet founded
in ashen ruin  its huge cone rising to a great height  where its reeking head
was swathed in cloud  its fires were now dimmed  and it stood in smouldering
slumber  as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast  behind it there hung
a vast shadow  ominous as a thunder-cloud  the
veils of barad-dûr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the ashen
mountains thrust down from the north  the dark power was deep in thought  and
the eye turned inward  pondering tidings of doubt and danger  a bright sword 
and a stern and kingly face it saw  and for a while it gave little thought to
other things  and all its great stronghold  gate on gate  and tower on tower 
was wrapped in a brooding gloom 
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land 
between them and the smoking mountain  and about it north and south  all seemed
ruinous and dead  a desert burned and choked  they wondered how the lord of this
realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies  yet armies he had  as far as
their eyes could reach  along the skirts of the morgai and away southward  there
were camps  some of tents  some ordered like small towns  one of the largest of
these was right below them  barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like
some huge nest of insects  with straight dreary streets of huts and long low
drab buildings  about it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro  a wide
road ran from it south-east to join the morgul-way  and along it many lines of
small black shapes were hurrying 
‘i don’t like the look of things at all ’ said sam  ‘pretty hopeless 
i call it - saving that where there’s such a lot of folk there must be wells
or water  not to mention food  and these are men not orcs  or my eyes are all
wrong ’
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm  beyond the fumes of the
mountain by the dark sad waters of lake núrnen  nor of the great roads
that ran away east and south to tributary lands  from which the soldiers of the
tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves 
here in the northward regions were the mines and forges  and the musterings of
long-planned war  and here the dark power  moving its armies like pieces on the
board  was gathering them together  its first moves  the first feelers of its
strength  had been checked upon its western line  southward and northward  for
the moment it withdrew them  and brought up new forces  massing them about
cirith gorgor for an avenging stroke  and if it had also been its purpose to
defend the mountain against all approach  it could scarcely have done more 
‘well ’ sam went on  ‘whatever they have to eat and drink  we can’t
get it  there’s no way down that i can see  and we couldn’t cross all that
open country crawling with enemies  even if we did get down ’
‘still we shall have to try ’ said frodo  ‘it’s no worse than i
expected  i never hoped to get across  i can’t see any hope of it now  but
i’ve still got to do the best i can  at present that is to avoid being
captured as long as possible  so we must still go northwards  i think  and see
what it is like where the open plain is narrower ’
‘i guess what it’ll be like ’ said sam  ‘where it’s narrower the
orcs and men will just be packed closer  you’ll see  mr  frodo ’
‘i dare say i shall  if we ever get so far ’ said frodo and turned away 
they soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the crest of
the morgai  or anywhere along its higher levels  pathless as they were and
scored with deep ghylls  in the end they were forced to go back down the ravine
that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley  it was rough going 
for they dared not cross over to the path on the westward side  after a mile or
more they saw  huddled in a hollow at the cliff’s foot  the orc-hold that they
had guessed was near at hand  a wall and a cluster of stone huts set about the
dark mouth of a cave  there was no movement to be seen  but the hobbits crept by
cautiously  keeping as much as they could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly
at this point along both sides of the old water-course 
they went two or three miles further  and the orc-hold was hidden from sight
behind them  but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh
and loud they heard orc-voices  quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown
and stunted bush  the voices drew nearer  presently two orcs came into view  one
was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn  it was of a small
breed  black-skinned  with wide and snuffling nostrils  evidently a tracker of
some kind  the other was a big fighting-orc  like those of shagrat’s company 
bearing the token of the eye  he also had a bow at his back and carried a short
broad-headed spear  as usual they were quarrelling  and being of different
breeds they used the common speech after their fashion 
hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped 
‘nar ’ it snarled  ‘i’m going home ’ it pointed across the valley to
the orc-hold  ‘no good wearing my nose out on stones any more  there’s not a
trace left  i say  i’ve lost the scent through giving way to you  it went up
into the hills  not along the valley  i tell you ’
‘not much use are you  you little snufflers ’ said the big orc  ‘i
reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses ’
‘then what have you seen with them ’ snarled the other  ‘garn  you
don’t even know what you’re looking for ’
‘whose blame’s that ’ said the soldier  ‘not mine  that comes from
higher up  first they say it’s a great elf in bright armour  then it’s a
sort of small dwarf-man  then it must be a pack of rebel uruk-hai  or maybe
it’s all the lot together ’
‘ar ’ said the tracker  ‘they’ve lost their heads  that’s what it
is  and some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too  i guess  if what i
hear is true  tower raided and all  and hundreds of your lads done in  and
prisoner got away  if that’s the way you fighters go on  small wonder
there’s bad news from the battles ’
‘who says there’s bad news ’ shouted the soldier 
‘ar  who says there isn’t ’
‘that’s cursed rebel-talk  and i’ll stick you  if you don’t shut it
down  see ’
‘all right  all right ’ said the tracker  ‘i’ll say no more and go on
thinking  but what’s the black sneak got to do with it all  that gobbler with
the flapping hands ’
‘i don’t know  nothing  maybe  but he’s up to no good  nosing around 
i’ll wager  curse him  no sooner had he slipped us and run off than word came
he’s wanted alive  wanted quick ’
‘well  i hope they get him and put him through it ’ growled the tracker 
‘he messed up the scent back there  pinching that cast-off mail-shirt that he
found  and paddling all round the place before i could get there ’
‘it saved his life anyhow ’ said the soldier  ‘why  before i knew he
was wanted i shot him  as neat as neat  at fifty paces right in the back  but he
ran on ’
‘garn  you missed him ’ said the tracker  ‘first you shoot wild  then
you run too slow  and then you send for the poor trackers  i’ve had enough of
you ’ he loped off 
‘you come back ’ shouted the soldier  ‘or i’ll report you ’
‘who to  not to your precious shagrat  he won’t be captain any more ’
‘i’ll give your name and number to the nazgûl ’ said the soldier
lowering his voice to a hiss  ‘one of them’s in charge at the
tower now ’
the other halted  and his voice was full of fear and rage  ‘you cursed
peaching sneakthief ’ he yelled  ‘you can’t do your job  and you can’t
even stick by your own folk  go to your filthy shriekers  and may they freeze
the flesh off you  if the enemy doesn’t get them first  they’ve done in
number one  i’ve heard  and i hope it’s true ’
the big orc  spear in hand  leapt after him  but the tracker  springing
behind a stone  put an arrow in his eye as he ran up  and he fell with a crash 
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared 
for a while the hobbits sat in silence  at length sam stirred  ‘well i call
that neat as neat ’ he said  ‘if this nice friendliness would spread about
in mordor  half our trouble would be over ’
‘quietly  sam ’ frodo whispered  ‘there may be others about  we have
evidently had a very narrow escape  and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than
we guessed  but that is the spirit of mordor  sam  and it has spread to every
corner of it  orcs have always behaved like that  or so all tales say  when they
are on their own  but you can’t get much hope out of it  they hate us far
more  altogether and all the time  if those two had seen us  they would have
dropped all their quarrel until we were dead ’
there was another long silence  sam broke it again  but with a whisper this
time  ‘did you hear what they said about that gobbler  mr  frodo  i
told you gollum wasn’t dead yet  didn’t i ’
‘yes  i remember  and i wondered how you knew ’ said frodo  ‘well come
now  i think we had better not move out from here again  until it has gone quite
dark  so you shall tell me how you know  and all about what happened  if you can
do it quietly ’
‘i’ll try ’ said sam  ‘but when i think of that stinker i get so hot
l could shout ’
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush  while the drear
light of mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night  and sam spoke into
frodo’s ear all that he could find words for of gollum’s treacherous attack 
the horror of shelob  and his own adventures with the orcs  when he had
finished  frodo said nothing but took sam’s hand and pressed it  at length he
stirred 
‘well  i suppose we must be going on again ’ he said  ‘i wonder how
long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the slinking
will be over  and in vain ’ he stood up  ‘it’s dark  and we cannot use the
lady’s glass  keep it safe for me  sam  i have nowhere to keep it now  except
in my hand  and i shall need both hands in the blind night  but sting i give to
you  i have got an orc-blade  but i do not think it will be my part to strike
any blow again ’
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless land  but
slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward
along the eastern edge of the stony valley  when a grey light crept back over
the western heights  long after day had opened in the lands beyond  they went
into hiding again and slept a little  turn by turn  in his times of waking sam
was busy with thoughts of food  at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of
eating and making ready for yet another effort  he asked the question that was
troubling him most 
‘begging your pardon  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘but have you any notion how
far there is still to go ’
‘no  not any clear notion  sam ’ frodo answered  ‘in rivendell before i
set out i was shown a map of mordor that was made before the enemy came back
here  but i only remember it vaguely  i remember clearest that there was a place
in the north where the western range and the northern range send out spurs that
nearly meet  that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the
tower  it might be a good point at which to cross  but of course  if we get
there  we shall be further than we were from the mountain  sixty miles from it 
i should think  i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the
bridge now  even if all goes well  i could hardly reach the mountain in a week 
i am afraid  sam  that the burden will get very heavy  and i shall go still
slower as we get nearer ’
sam sighed  ‘that’s just as i feared ’ he said  ‘well  to say nothing
of water  we’ve got to eat less  mr  frodo  or else move a bit quicker  at any
rate while we’re still in this valley  one more bite and all the food’s
ended  save the elves’ waybread ’
‘i’ll try and be a bit quicker  sam ’ said frodo  drawing a deep
breath  ‘come on then  let’s start another march ’
it was not yet quite dark again  they plodded along  on into the night  the
hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts  at the first
hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves
again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone 
slowly the light grew  until it was clearer than it yet had been  a strong
wind from the west was now driving the fumes of mordor from the upper airs 
before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some miles
about them  the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards  and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf
in the steep faces of the ephel dúath  but
to the east it fell as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth  ahead the
water-course came to an end in broken steps of rock  for out from the main range
there sprang a high barren spur  thrusting eastward like a wall  to meet it
there stretched out from the grey and misty northern range of ered lithui a long
jutting arm  and between the ends there was a narrow gap  carach angren  the
isenmouthe  beyond which lay the deep dale of udûn  in that dale behind
the morannon were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of
mordor had made for the defence of the black gate of their land  and there now
their lord was gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the
captains of the west  upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built  and
watch-fires burned  and all across the gap an earth-wall had been raised  and a
deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge 
a few miles north  high up in the angle where the western spur branched away
from the main range  stood the old castle of
durthang  now one of the many orc-holds that clustered about the dale of udûn 
a road  already visible in the growing light  came winding down from it  until
only a mile or two from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran
along a shelf cut in the side of the spur  and so went down into the plain  and
on to the isenmouthe 
to the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey north had
been useless  the plain to their right was dim and smoky  and they could see
there neither camps nor troops moving  but all that region was under the
vigilance of the forts of carach angren 
‘we have come to a dead end  sam ’ said frodo  ‘if we go on  we shall
only come up to that orc-tower  but the only road to take is that road that
comes down from it - unless we go back  we can’t climb up westward  or climb
down eastward ’
‘then we must take the road  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘we must take it and
chance our luck  if there is any luck in mordor  we might as well give ourselves
up as wander about any more  or try to go back  our food won’t last  we’ve
got to make a dash for it ’
‘all right  sam ’ said frodo  ‘lead me  as long as you’ve got any
hope left  mine is gone  but i can’t dash  sam  i’ll just plod along after
you ’
‘before you start any more plodding  you need sleep and food  mr  frodo 
come and take what you can get of them ’
he gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread  and he made a
pillow of his cloak for his master’s head  frodo was too weary to debate the
matter  and sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water 
and eaten sam’s share of the food as well as his own  when frodo was asleep
sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face  it was
lined and thin  and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid  ‘well  here
goes  master ’ sam muttered to himself  ‘i’ll have to leave you for a bit
and trust to luck  water we must have  or we’ll get no further ’
sam crept out  and flitting from stone to stone with more than hobbit-care 
he went down to the water-course  and then followed it for some way as it
climbed north  until he came to the rock-steps where long ago  no doubt  its
spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall  all now seemed dry and
silent  but refusing to despair sam stooped and listened  and to his delight he
caught the sound of trickling  clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the hill-side and filled a little bare pool 
from which again it spilled  and vanished then under the barren stones 
sam tasted the water  and it seemed good enough  then he drank deeply 
refilled the bottle  and turned to go back  at that moment he caught a glimpse
of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near frodo’s
hiding-place  biting back a cry  he leapt down from the spring and ran  jumping
from stone to stone  it was a wary creature  difficult to see  but sam had
little doubt about it  he longed to get his hands on its neck  but it heard him
coming and slipped quickly away  sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of
it  peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice  before it ducked and
disappeared 
‘well  luck did not let me down ’ muttered sam  ‘but that was a near
thing  isn’t it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that stinking
villain coming nosing round  i wish he had been shot ’ he sat down by frodo
and did not rouse him  but he did not dare to go to sleep himself  at last when
he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could not go
on much longer  he wakened frodo gently 
‘that gollum’s about again  i’m afraid  mr  frodo ’ he said 
‘leastways  if it wasn’t him  then there’s two of him  i went away to find
some water and spied him nosing round just as i turned back  i reckon it isn’t
safe for us both to sleep together  and begging your pardon  but i can’t hold
up my lids much longer ’
‘bless you  sam ’ said frodo  ‘lie down and take your proper turn  but
i’d rather have gollum than orcs  at any rate he won’t give us away to them
- not unless he’s caught himself ’
‘but he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own ’ growled sam 
‘keep your eyes open  mr  frodo  there’s a bottle full of water  drink up 
we can fill it again when we go on ’ with that sam plunged into sleep 
light was fading when he woke  frodo sat propped against the rock behind  but
he had fallen asleep  the water-bottle was empty  there was no sign of gollum 
mordor-dark had returned  and the watch-fires on the heights burned fierce
and red  when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage of all their
journey  they went first to the little spring  and then climbing warily up they
came to the road at the point where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty
miles away  it was not a broad road  and it had no wall or parapet along the
edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper 
the hobbits could hear no movements  and after listening for a while they set
off eastward at a steady pace 
after doing some twelve miles  they halted  a short way back the road had
bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now
screened from sight  this proved disastrous  they rested for some minutes and
then went on  but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the stillness
of the night they heard the sound that all along they had secretly dreaded  the
noise of marching feet  it was still some way behind them  but looking back they
could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away 
and they were moving fast  too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the road
ahead 
‘i feared it  sam ’ said frodo  ‘we’ve trusted to luck  and it has
failed us  we’re trapped ’ he looked wildly up at the frowning wall  where
the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their
heads  he ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of
gloom  ‘we’re trapped at last ’ he said he sank to the ground beneath the
wall of rock and bowed his head 
‘seems so ’ said sam  ‘well  we can but wait and see ’ and with that
he sat down beside frodo under the shadow of the cliff 
they did not have to wait long  the orcs were going at a great pace  those in
the foremost files bore torches  on they came  red flames in the dark  swiftly
growing  now sam too bowed his head  hoping that it would hide his face when the
torches reached them  and he set their shields before their knees to hide their
feet 
‘if only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers alone
and pass on ’ he thought 
and so it seemed that they would  the leading orcs came loping along 
panting  holding their heads down  they were a gang of the smaller breeds being
driven unwilling to their dark lord’s wars  all they cared for was to get the
march over and escape the whip  beside them  running up and down the line  went
two of the large fierce uruks  cracking lashes and shouting  file after
file passed  and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead  sam held
his breath  now more than half the line had gone by  then suddenly one of the
slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side  he flicked a whip at them
and yelled  ‘hi  you  get up ’ they did not answer  and with a shout he
halted the whole company 
‘come on  you slugs ’ he cried  ‘this is
no time for slouching ’ he took a step towards them  and even in the gloom he
recognized the devices on their shields  ‘deserting  eh ’ he snarled  ‘or
thinking of it  all your folk should have been inside udûn before
yesterday evening  you know that  up you get and fall in  or i’ll have
your numbers and report you ’
they struggled to their feet  and keeping bent  limping like footsore
soldiers  they shuffled back towards the rear of the line  ‘no  not at the
rear ’ the slave-driver shouted  ‘three files up  and stay there  or
you’ll know it  when i come down the line ’ he sent his long whip-lash
cracking over their heads  then with another crack and a yell he started the
company off again at a brisk trot 
it was hard enough for poor sam  tired as he was  but for frodo it was a
torment  and soon a nightmare  he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind from
thinking  and he struggled on  the stench of the sweating orcs about him was
stifling  and he began to gasp with thirst  on  on they went  and he bent all
his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going  and yet to what
evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think  there was no hope of
falling out unseen  now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeered at them 
‘there now ’ he laughed  flicking at their legs  ‘where there’s a
whip there’s a will  my slugs  hold up  i’d give you a nice freshener now 
only you’ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to
your camp  do you good  don’t you know we’re at war ’
they had gone some miles  and the road was at last running down a long slope
into the plain  when frodo’s strength began to give out and his will wavered 
he lurched and stumbled  desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up 
though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer  at any
moment now he knew that the end would come  his master would faint or fall  and
all would be discovered  and their bitter efforts be in vain  ‘i’ll have
that big slave-driving devil anyway ’ he thought 
then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword  there came an
unexpected relief  they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance
to udûn  some way in front of it  before the gate at the bridge-end  the
road from the west converged with others coming from the south  and from barad-dûr 
along all the roads troops were moving  for the captains of the west were
advancing and the dark lord was speeding his forces north  so it chanced that
several companies came together at the road-meeting  in the dark beyond
the light of the watch-fires on the wall  at once there was great jostling and
cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their
march  though the drivers yelled and plied their whips  scuffles broke out and
some blades were drawn  a troop of heavy-armed uruks
from barad-dûr charged into the durthang line and threw them into
confusion 
dazed as he was with pain and weariness  sam woke up  grasped quickly at his
chance  and threw himself to the ground  dragging frodo down with him  orcs fell
over them  snarling and cursing  slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled
away out of the turmoil  until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further
edge of the road  it had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog  and it was banked up some feet above the level
of the open land 
they lay still for a while  it was too dark to seek for cover  if indeed
there was any to find  but sam felt that they ought at least to get further away
from the highways and out of the range of torch-light 
‘come on  mr  frodo ’ he whispered  ‘one more crawl  and then you can
lie still ’
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on his hands  and
struggled on for maybe twenty yards  then he pitched down into a shallow pit
that opened unexpectedly before them  and there he lay like a dead thing 
 
sam put his ragged orc-cloak under his master’s head  and covered them both
with the grey robe of lórien  and as he did so his thoughts went
out to that fair land  and to the elves  and he hoped that the cloth woven by
their hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this
wilderness of fear  he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the troops
passed on through the isenmouthe  it seemed that in the confusion and the
mingling of many companies of various kinds they had not been missed  not yet at
any rate 
sam took a sip of water  but pressed frodo to drink  and when his master had
recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made
him eat it  then  too worn out even to feel much fear  they stretched themselves
out  they slept a little in uneasy fits  for their sweat grew chill on them  and
the hard stones bit them  and they shivered  out of the north from the black
gate through cirith gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold
air 
in the morning a grey light came again  for in the high regions the west wind
still blew  but down on the stones behind the fences of the black land the air
seemed almost dead  chill and yet stifling  sam looked up out of the hollow  the
land all about was dreary  flat and drab-hued  on the roads nearby nothing was
moving now  but sam feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe  no
more than a furlong away northward  south-eastward  far off like a dark standing
shadow  loomed the mountain  smokes were pouring from it and while those that
rose into the upper air trailed away eastward  great rolling clouds floated down
its sides and spread over the land  a few miles to the north-east the foothills
of the ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts  behind which the misty
northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the
lowering sky 
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to take 
it looks every step of fifty miles ’ he muttered gloomily staring at the
threatening mountain  ‘and that’ll take a week  if it takes a day  with mr 
frodo as he is ’ he shook his head  and as he worked things out  slowly a new
dark thought grew in his mind  never for long had hope died in his staunch
heart  and always until now he had taken some thought for their return  but the
bitter truth came home to him at last  at best their provision would take them
to their goal  and when the task was done  there they would come to an end 
alone  houseless  foodless in the midst of a terrible desert  there could be no
return 
‘so that was the job i felt i had to do when i started ’ thought sam 
‘to help mr  frodo to the last step and then die with him  well  if that is
the job then i must do it  but i would dearly like to see bywater again  and
rosie cotton and her brothers  and the gaffer and marigold and all  i can’t
think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr  frodo on this errand if there
hadn’t a’ been any hope of his ever coming back at all  things all went
wrong when he went down in moria  i wish he hadn’t  he would have done
something ’
but even as hope died in sam  or seemed to die  it was turned to a new
strength  sam’s plain hobbit-face grew stern  almost grim  as the will
hardened in him  and he felt through all his limbs a thrill  as if he was
turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness
nor endless barren miles could subdue 
with a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the ground
near at hand  studying the next move  as the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and featureless flats were in
fact all broken and tumbled  indeed the whole surface of the plains of gorgoroth
was pocked with great holes  as if  while it was still a waste of soft mud  it
had been smitten with a shower of bolts and huge slingstones  the largest of
these holes were rimmed with ridges of broken rock  and broad fissures ran out
from them in all directions  it was a land in which it would be possible to
creep from hiding to hiding  unseen by all but the most watchful eyes  possible
at least for one who was strong and had no need for speed  for the hungry and
worn  who had far to go before life failed  it had an evil look 
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master  he had no need to
rouse him  frodo was lying on his back with eyes open  staring at the cloudy
sky  ‘well  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘i’ve been having a look round and
thinking a bit  there’s nothing on the roads  and we’d best be getting away
while there’s a chance  can you manage it ’
‘i can manage it ’ said frodo  ‘i must ’
once more they started  crawling from hollow to hollow  flitting behind such
cover as they could find  but moving always in a slant towards the foothills of
the northern range  but as they went the most easterly of the roads followed
them  until it ran off  hugging the skirts of the mountains  away into a wall of
black shadow far ahead  neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey
stretches  for the dark lord had almost completed the movement of his forces 
and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought the secrecy of night 
fearing the winds of the world that had turned against him  tearing aside his
veils  and troubled with tidings of bold spies that had passed through his
fences 
the hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted  frodo seemed nearly
spent  sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion  crawling 
stooping  now picking a doubtful way very slowly  now hurrying at a stumbling
run 
‘i’m going back on to the road while the light lasts  mr  frodo ’ he
said  ‘trust to luck again  it nearly failed us last time  but it didn’t
quite  a steady pace for a few more miles  and then a rest ’
he was taking a far greater risk than he knew  but frodo was too much
occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate  and almost
too hopeless to care  they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along  down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself  but their luck held  and
for the rest of that day they met no living or moving thing  and when night fell
they vanished into the darkness of mordor  all the land now brooded as at the
coming of a great storm  for the captains of the west had passed the cross-roads
and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul 
so the desperate journey went on  as the ring went south and the banners of
the kings rode north  for the hobbits each day  each mile  was more bitter than
the one before  as their strength lessened and the land became more evil  they
met no enemies by day  at times by night  as they cowered or drowsed uneasily in
some hiding beside the road  they heard cries and the noise of many feet or the
swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed  but far worse than all such perils
was the ever-approaching threat that beat upon them as they went  the dreadful
menace of the power that waited  brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice
behind the dark veil about its throne  nearer and nearer it drew  looming
blacker  like the oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world 
there came at last a dreadful nightfall  and even as the captains of the west
drew near to the end of the living lands  the two wanderers came to an hour of
blank despair  four days had passed since they had escaped from the orcs  but
the time lay behind them like an ever-darkening dream  all this last day frodo
had not spoken  but had walked half-bowed  often stumbling  as if his eyes no
longer saw the way before his feet  sam guessed that among all their pains he
bore the worst  the growing weight of the ring  a burden on the body and a
torment to his mind  anxiously sam had noted how his master’s left hand would
often be raised as if to ward on a blow  or to screen his shrinking eyes from a
dreadful eye that sought to look in them  and sometimes his right hand would
creep to his breast  clutching  and then slowly  as the will recovered mastery 
it would be withdrawn 
now as the blackness of night returned frodo sat  his head between his knees 
his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly twitching  sam
watched him  till night covered them both and hid them from one another  he
could no longer find any words to say  and he turned to his own dark thoughts 
as for himself  though weary and under a shadow of fear  he still had some
strength left  the lembas had a virtue without which they would long ago
have lain down to die  it did not satisfy desire  and at times sam’s mind was
filled with the memories of food  and the longing for simple bread and meats 
and yet this waybread of the elves had a potency that increased as travellers
relied on it alone and did not mingle it with other foods  it fed the will  and
it gave strength to endure  and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of
mortal kind  but now a new decision must be made  they could not follow this
road any longer  for it went on eastward into the great shadow  but the mountain
now loomed upon their right  almost due south  and they must turn towards it 
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming  barren  ash-ridden
land 
‘water  water ’ muttered sam  he had stinted himself  and in his parched
mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen  but for all his care they now had
very little left  perhaps half his bottle  and maybe there were still days to
go  all would long ago have been spent  if they had not dared to follow the
orc-road  for at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been built for the
use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions  in one sam had found
some water left  stale  muddied by the orcs  but still sufficient for their
desperate case  yet that was now a day ago  there was no hope of any more 
at last wearied with his cares sam drowsed  leaving the morrow till it came 
he could do no more  dream and waking mingled uneasily  he saw lights like
gloating yes  and dark creeping shapes  and he heard noises as of wild beasts or
the dreadful cries of tortured things  and he would start up to find the world
all dark and only empty blackness all about him  once only  as he stood and
stared wildly round  did it seem that  though now awake  he could still see pale
lights like eyes  but soon they flickered and vanished 
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly  such daylight as followed
was dim  for here as the mountain drew near the air was ever mirky  while out
from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that sauron wove about
himself  frodo was lying on his back not moving  sam stood beside him  reluctant
to speak  and yet knowing that the word now lay with him  he must set his
master’s will to work for another effort  at length  stooping and caressing
frodo’s brow  he spoke in his ear 
‘wake up  master ’ he said  ‘time for another start ’
as if roused by a sudden bell  frodo rose quickly  and stood up and looked
away southwards  but when his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed
again 
‘i can’t manage it  sam ’ he said  ‘it is such a weight to carry 
such a weight ’
sam knew before he spoke  that it was vain  and that such words might do more
harm than good  but in his pity he could not keep silent  ‘then let me carry
it a bit for you  master ’ he said  ‘you know i would  and gladly  as long
as i have any strength ’
a wild light came into frodo’s eyes  ‘stand away  don’t touch me ’ he
cried  ‘it is mine  i say  be off ’ his hand strayed to his sword-hilt  but
then quickly his voice changed  ‘no  no  sam ’ he said sadly  ‘but you
must understand  it is my burden  and no one else can bear it  it is too late
now  sam dear  you can’t help me in that way again  i am almost in its power
now  i could not give it up  and if you tried to take it i should go mad ’
sam nodded  ‘i understand ’ he said  ‘but i’ve been thinking  mr 
frodo  there’s other things we might do without  why not lighten the load a
bit  we’re going that way now  as straight as we can make it ’ he pointed to
the mountain  ‘it’s no good taking anything we’re not sure to need ’
frodo looked again towards the mountain  ‘no ’ he said  ‘we shan’t
need much on that road  and at its end nothing ’ picking up his orc-shield he
flung it away and threw his helmet after it  then pulling off the grey cloak he
undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground  and the sheathed sword with
it  the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered 
‘there  i’ll be an orc no more ’ he cried  ‘and i’ll bear no weapon
fair or foul  let them take me  if they will ’
sam did likewise  and put aside his orc-gear  and he took out all the things
in his pack  somehow each of them had become dear to him  if only because he had
borne them so far with so much toil  hardest of all it was to part with his
cooking-gear  tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away 
‘do you remember that bit of rabbit  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘and our
place under the warm bank in captain faramir’s country  the day i saw an
oliphaunt ’
‘no  i am afraid not  sam ’ said frodo  ‘at least  i know that such
things happened  but i cannot see them  no taste of food  no feel of water  no
sound of wind  no memory of tree or grass or flower  no image of moon or star
are left to me  i am naked in the dark  sam  and there is no veil between me and
the wheel of fire  i begin to see it even with my waking eyes  and all else
fades ’
sam went to him and kissed his hand  ‘then the sooner we’re rid of it 
the sooner to rest ’ he said haltingly  finding no better words to say 
‘talking won’t mend nothing ’ he muttered to himself  as he gathered up
all the things that they had chosen to cast away  he was not willing to leave
them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see  ‘stinker picked up that
orc-shirt  seemingly  and he isn’t going to add a sword to it  his hands are
bad enough when empty  and he isn’t going to mess with my pans ’ with that
he carried all the gear away to one of the many gaping fissures that scored the
land and threw them in  the clatter of his precious pans as they fell down into
the dark was like a death-knell to his heart 
he came back to frodo  and then of his elven-rope he cut a short piece to
serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist  the
rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack  beside that he kept only the
remnants of their waybread and the water-bottle  and sting still hanging by his
belt  and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his breast the phial of
galadriel and the little box that she gave him for his own 
now at last they turned their faces to the mountain and set out  thinking no
more of concealment  bending their weariness and failing wills only to the one
task of going on  in the dimness of its dreary day few things even in that land
of vigilance could have espied them  save from close at hand  of all the slaves
of the dark lord  only the nazgûl could have warned him of the peril that
crept  small but indomitable  into the very heart of his guarded realm  but the
nazgûl and their black wings were abroad on another errand  they
were gathered far away  shadowing the march of the captains of the west  and
thither the thought of the dark tower was turned 
that day it seemed to sam that his master had found some new strength  more
than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had to
carry  in the first marches they went further and faster than he had hoped  the
land was rough and hostile  and yet they made much progress  and ever the
mountain drew nearer  but as the day wore on and all too soon the dim light
began to fail  frodo stooped again  and began to stagger  as if the renewed
effort had squandered his remaining strength 
at their last halt he sank down and said  ‘i’m thirsty  sam ’ and did
not speak again  sam gave him a mouthful of water  only one more mouthful
remained  he went without himself  and now as once more the night of mordor
closed over them  through all his thoughts there came the memory of water  and
every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen  under green willow-shades
or twinkling in the sun  danced and rippled for his torment behind the blindness
of his eyes  he felt the cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the pool at
bywater with jolly cotton and tom and nibs  and their sister rosie  ‘but that
was years ago ’ he sighed  ‘and far away  the way back  if there is one 
goes past the mountain ’
he could not sleep and he held a debate with himself  ‘well  come now 
we’ve done better than you hoped ’ he said sturdily  ‘began well anyway  i
reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped  one more day will do
it ’ and then he paused 
‘don’t be a fool  sam gamgee ’ came an answer in his own voice  ‘he
won’t go another day like that  if he moves at all  and you can’t go on much
longer giving him all the water and most of the food ’
‘i can go on a good way though  and i will ’
‘where to ’
‘to the mountain  of course ’
‘but what then  sam gamgee  what then  when you get there  what are you
going to do  he won’t be able to do anything for himself ’
to his dismay sam realized that he had not got an answer to this  he had no
clear idea at all  frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand  and sam only
knew vaguely that the ring had somehow to be put into the fire  ‘the cracks of
doom ’ he muttered  the old name rising to his mind  ‘well  if master knows
how to find them  i don’t ’
‘there you are ’ came the answer  ‘it’s all quite useless  he said so
himself  you are the fool  going on hoping and toiling  you could have lain down
and gone to sleep together days ago  if you hadn’t been so dogged  but
you’ll die just the same  or worse  you might just as well lie down now and
give it up  you’ll never get to the top anyway ’
‘i’ll get there  if i leave everything but my bones behind ’ said sam 
‘and i’ll carry mr  frodo up myself  if it breaks my back and heart  so stop
arguing ’
at that moment sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him  and he heard or
sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the earth  there was
a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away  the mountain
too slept uneasily 
the last stage of their journey to orodruin came  and it was a torment
greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear  he was in pain  and so
parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food  it remained
dark  not only because of the smokes of the mountain  there seemed to be a storm
coming up  and away to the south-east there was a shimmer of lightnings under
the black skies  worst of all  the air was full of fumes  breathing was painful
and difficult  and a dizziness came on them  so that they staggered and often
fell  and yet their wills did not yield  and they struggled on 
the mountain crept up ever nearer  until  if they lifted their heavy heads 
it filled all their sight  looming vast before them  a huge mass of ash and slag
and burned stone  out of which a sheer-sided cone was raised into the clouds 
before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again they had crawled and
stumbled to its very feet 
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground  sam sat by him  to his surprise
he felt tired but lighter  and his head seemed clear again  no more debates
disturbed his mind  he knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to
them  his will was set  and only death would break it  he felt no longer either
desire or need of sleep  but rather of watchfulness  he knew that all the
hazards and perils were now drawing together to a point  the next day would be a
day of doom  the day of final effort or disaster  the last gasp 
but when would it come  the night seemed endless and timeless  minute after
minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour  bringing no change  sam
began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day would ever reappear 
at last he groped for frodo’s hand  it was cold and trembling  his master was
shivering 
‘i didn’t ought to have left my blanket behind ’ muttered sam  and
lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body  then sleep took
him  and the dim light of the last day of their quest found them side by side 
the wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the west  and now it came
from the north and began to rise  and slowly the light of the unseen sun
filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay 
‘now for it  now for the last gasp ’ said sam as he struggled to his
feet  he bent over frodo  rousing him gently  frodo groaned  but with a great
effort of will he staggered up  and then he fell upon his knees again  he raised
his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of mount doom towering above him 
and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands 
sam looked at him and wept in his heart  but no tears came to his dry and
stinging eyes  ‘i said i’d carry him  if it broke my back ’ he muttered 
‘and i will ’
‘come  mr  frodo ’ he cried  ‘i can’t carry it for you  but i can
carry you and it as well  so up you get  come on  mr  frodo dear  sam will give
you a ride  just tell him where to go  and he’ll go ’
as frodo clung upon his back  arms loosely about his neck  legs clasped
firmly under his arms  sam staggered to his feet  and then to his amazement he
felt the burden light  he had feared that he would have barely strength to lift
his master alone  and beyond that he had expected to share in the dreadful
dragging weight of the accursed ring  but it was not so  whether because frodo
was so worn by his long pains  wound of knife  and venomous sting  and sorrow 
fear  and homeless wandering  or because some gift of final strength was given
to him  sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty than if he were carrying a
hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on the lawns or hayfields of the shire  he
took a deep breath and started off 
they had reached the mountain’s foot on its northern side  and a little to
the westward  there its long grey slopes  though broken  were not sheer  frodo
did not speak  and so sam struggled on as best he could  having no guidance but
the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave out and his will
broke  on he toiled  up and up  turning this way and that to lessen the slope 
often stumbling forward  and at the last crawling like a snail with a heavy
burden on its back  when his will could drive him no further  and his limbs gave
way  he stopped and laid his master gently down 
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath  it was easier to breathe up here
above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below  ‘thank you  sam ’ he
said in a cracked whisper  ‘how far is there to go ’
‘i don’t know ’ said sam  ‘because i don’t know where we’re
going ’
he looked back  and then he looked up  and he was amazed to see how far his
last effort had brought him  the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked
taller than it was  sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high
passes of the ephel dúath which he and frodo had scaled  the confused and
tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above the
plain  and above them was reared half as high again its tall central cone  like
a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater  but already sam was
more than half way up the base  and the plain of gorgoroth was dim below him 
wrapped in fume and shadow  as he looked up he would have given a shout  if his
parched throat had allowed him  for amid the rugged humps and shoulders above
him he saw plainly a path or road  it climbed like a rising girdle from the west
and wound snakelike about the mountain  until before it went round out of view
it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side 
sam could not see the course immediately above him  where it was lowest  for
a steep slope went up from where he stood  but he guessed that if he could only
struggle on just a little way further up  they would strike this path  a gleam
of hope returned to him  they might conquer the mountain yet  ‘why  it might
have been put there a-purpose ’ he said to himself  ‘if it wasn’t there 
i’d have to say i was beaten in the end ’
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam  he did not know it  but
he was looking at sauron’s road from barad-dûr
to the sammath naur  the chambers of fire  out from the dark tower’s huge
western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron  and then
passing into the plain it ran for a league between two smoking chasms  and so reached
a long sloping causeway that led up on to the mountain’s eastern side  thence 
turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north  it climbed at
last  high in the upper cone  but still far from the reeking summit  to a dark
entrance that gazed back east straight to the window of the eye in sauron’s
shadow-mantled fortress  often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the
mountain’s furnaces  always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the
labours of countless orcs 
sam drew a deep breath  there was a path  but how he was to get up the slope
to it he did not know  first he must ease his aching back  he lay flat beside
frodo for a while  neither spoke  slowly the light grew  suddenly a sense of
urgency which he did not understand came to sam  it was almost as if he had been
called  ‘now  now  or it will be too late ’ he braced himself and got up 
frodo also seemed to have felt the call  he struggled to his knees 
‘i’ll crawl  sam ’ he gasped 
so foot by foot  like small grey insects  they crept up the slope  they came
to the path and found that it was broad  paved with broken rubble and beaten
ash  frodo clambered on to it  and then moved as if by some compulsion he turned
slowly to face the east  far off the shadows of sauron hung  but torn by some
gust of wind out of the world  or else moved by some great disquiet within  the
mantling clouds swirled  and for a moment drew aside  and then he saw  rising
black  blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood  the cruel
pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of
barad-dûr  one moment only it stared out  but as from some great window
immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red  the flicker of a
piercing eye  and then the shadows were furled again and the terrible
vision was removed  the eye was not turned to them  it was gazing north to where
the captains of the west stood at bay  and thither all its malice was now bent 
as the power moved to strike its deadly blow  but frodo at that dreadful glimpse
fell as one stricken mortally  his hand sought the chain about his neck 
sam knelt by him  faint  almost inaudibly  he heard frodo whispering  ‘help
me  sam  help me  sam  hold my hand  i can’t stop it ’ sam took his
master’s hands and laid them together  palm to palm  and kissed them  and then
he held them gently between his own  the thought came suddenly to him  ‘he’s
spotted us  it’s all up  or it soon will be  now  sam gamgee  this is the end
of ends ’
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast  letting his
master’s legs dangle  then he bowed his head and struggled off along the
climbing road  it was not as easy a way to take as it had looked at first  by
fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils when sam stood
upon cirith ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern and western slopes  and
the road on this side was not blocked  yet in many places it had crumbled away
or was crossed by gaping rents  after climbing eastward for some time it bent
back upon itself at a sharp angle and went westward fox a space  there at the
bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered stone once long ago vomited
from the mountain’s furnaces  panting under his load sam turned the bend  and
even as he did so  out of the corner of his eye  he had a glimpse of something
falling from the crag  like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as
he passed 
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward  tearing the backs of his
hands that still clasped his master’s  then he knew what had happened  for
above him as he lay he heard a hated voice 
‘wicked masster ’ it hissed  ‘wicked masster
cheats us  cheats sméagol  gollum  he musstn’t go that
way  he musstn’t hurt preciouss  give it to sméagol 
yess  give it to us  give it to uss ’
with a violent heave sam rose up  at once he drew his sword  but he could do
nothing  gollum and frodo were locked together  gollum was tearing at his
master  trying to get at the chain and the ring  this was probably the only
thing that could have roused the dying embers of frodo’s heart and will  an
attack  an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force  he fought back with
a sudden fury that amazed sam  and gollum also  even so things might have gone
far otherwise  if gollum himself had remained unchanged  but whatever dreadful
paths  lonely and hungry and waterless  he had trodden  driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible fear  they had left grievous marks on him  he was a lean 
starved  haggard thing  all bones and tight-drawn sallow skin  a wild light
flamed in his eyes  but his malice was no longer matched by his old griping
strength  frodo flung him off and rose up quivering 
‘down  down ’ he gasped  clutching his hand to his breast  so that
beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring  ‘down you creeping
thing  and out of my path  your time is at an end  you cannot betray me or slay
me now ’
then suddenly  as before under the eaves of the emyn muil  sam saw these two
rivals with other vision  a crouching shape  scarcely more than the shadow of a
living thing  a creature now wholly ruined and defeated  yet filled with a
hideous lust and rage  and before it stood stern  untouchable now by pity  a
figure robed in white  but at its breast it held a wheel of fire  out of the
fire there spoke a commanding voice 
‘begone  and trouble me no more  if you touch me ever again  you shall be
cast yourself into the fire of doom ’
the crouching shape backed away  terror in its blinking eyes  and yet at the
same time insatiable desire 
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing  hand on breast  his breath
coming in great gasps  and gollum at his feet  resting on his knees with his
wide-splayed hands upon the ground 
‘look out ’ cried sam  ‘he’ll spring ’ he stepped forward 
brandishing his sword  ‘quick  master ’ he gasped  ‘go on  go on  no time
to lose  i’ll deal with him  go on ’
frodo looked at him as if at one now far away  ‘yes  i must go on ’ he
said  ‘farewell  sam  this is the end at last  on mount doom doom shall fall 
farewell ’ he turned and went on  walking slowly but erect up the climbing
path 
‘now ’ said sam  ‘at last i can deal with you ’ he leaped forward
with drawn blade ready for battle  but gollum did not spring  he fell flat upon
the ground and whimpered 
‘don’t kill us ’ he wept  ‘don’t hurt us with nassty cruel steel 
let us live  yes  live just a little longer  lost lost  we’re lost  and when
precious goes we’ll die  yes  die into the dust ’ he clawed up the ashes of
the path with his long fleshless fingers  ‘dusst ’ he hissed 
sam’s hand wavered  his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil  it
would be just to slay this treacherous  murderous creature  just and many times
deserved  and also it seemed the only safe thing to do  but deep in his heart
there was something that restrained him  he could not strike this thing lying in
the dust  forlorn  ruinous  utterly wretched  he himself  though only for a
little while  had borne the ring  and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollum’s shrivelled mind and body  enslaved to that ring  unable to find peace
or relief ever in life again  but sam had no words to express what he felt 
‘oh  curse you  you stinking thing ’ he said  ‘go away  be off  i
don’t trust you  not as far as i could kick you  but be off  or i shall
hurt you  yes  with nasty cruel steel ’
gollum got up on all fours  and backed away for several paces  and then he
turned  and as sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path  sam gave no
more heed to him  he suddenly remembered his master  he looked up the path and
could not see him  as fast as he could he trudged up the road  if he had looked
back  he might have seen not far below gollum turn again  and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come  swiftly but warily  creeping on
behind  a slinking shadow among the stones 
the path climbed on  soon it bent again and  with a last eastward course
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to the dark door in the
mountain’s side  the door of the sammath naur  far away now rising towards the
south the sun  piercing the smokes and haze  burned ominous  a dull bleared disc
of red  but all mordor lay about the mountain like a dead land  silent 
shadow-folded  waiting for some dreadful stroke 
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in  it was dark and hot  and a deep
rumbling shook the air  ‘frodo  master ’ he called  there was no answer  for
a moment he stood  his heart beating with wild fears  and then he plunged in  a
shadow followed him 
at first he could see nothing  in his great need he drew out once more the
phial of galadriel  but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and threw no
light into that stifling dark  he was come to the heart of the realm of sauron
and the forges of his ancient might  greatest in middle-earth  all other powers
were here subdued  fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark  and then
all at once there came a flash of red that leaped upward  and smote the high
black roof  then sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into
the mountain’s smoking cone  but only a short way ahead its floor and the
walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure  out of which the red glare
came  now leaping up  now dying down into darkness  and all the while far below
there was a rumour and a trouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring 
the light sprang up again  and there on the brink of the chasm  at the very
crack of doom  stood frodo  black against the glare  tense  erect  but still as
if he had been turned to stone 
‘master ’ cried sam 
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice  indeed with a voice clearer
and more powerful than sam had ever heard him use  and it rose above the throb
and turmoil of mount doom  ringing in the roof and walls 
‘i have come ’ he said  ‘but i do not choose now to do what i came to
do  i will not do this deed  the ring is mine ’ and suddenly  as he set it on
his finger  he vanished from sam’s sight  sam gasped  but he had no chance to
cry out  for at that moment many things happened 
something struck sam violently in the back  his legs were knocked from under
him and he was flung aside  striking his head against the stony floor  as a dark
shape sprang over him  he lay still and for a moment all went black 
and far away  as frodo put on the ring and claimed it for
his own  even in sammath naur the very heart of his realm  the power in barad-dûr
was shaken  and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter
crown  the dark lord was suddenly aware of him  and his eye piercing all shadows
looked across the plain to the door that he had made  and the magnitude
of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash  and all the devices of
his enemies were at last laid bare  then his wrath blazed in consuming flame 
but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him  for he knew his deadly
peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung 
from all his policies and webs of fear and treachery  from all his stratagems
and wars his mind shook free  and throughout his realm a tremor ran  his slaves
quailed  and his armies halted  and his captains suddenly steerless  bereft of
will  wavered and despaired  for they were forgotten  the whole mind and purpose
of the power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the
mountain  at his summons  wheeling with a rending
cry  in a last desperate race there flew  faster than the winds  the nazgûl
the ringwraiths  and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to mount
doom 
sam got up  he was dazed  and blood streaming from his head dripped in his
eyes  he groped forward  and then he saw a strange and terrible thing  gollum on
the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe  to and
fro he swayed  now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in  now dragging
back  falling to the ground  rising  and falling again  and all the while he
hissed but spoke no words 
the fires below awoke in anger  the red light blazed  and all the cavern was
filled with a great glare and heat  suddenly sam saw gollum’s long hands draw
upwards to his mouth  his white fangs gleamed  and then snapped as they bit 
frodo gave a cry  and there he was  fallen upon his knees at the chasm’s edge 
but gollum  dancing like a mad thing  held aloft the ring  a finger still thrust
within its circle  it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire 
‘precious  precious  precious ’ gollum cried  ‘my precious  o my
precious ’ and with that  even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his
prize  he stepped too far  toppled  wavered for a moment on the brink  and then
with a shriek he fell  out of the depths came his last wail precious  and
he was gone 
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise  fires leaped up and licked
the roof  the throbbing grew to a great tumult  and the mountain shook  sam ran
to frodo and picked him up and carried him  out to the door  and there upon the
dark threshold of the sammath naur  high above the plains of mordor  such wonder
and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting all else  and gazed as one
turned to stone 
a brief vision he had of swirling cloud  and in the midst of it towers and
battlements  tall as hills  founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above
immeasurable pits  great courts and dungeons  eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs 
and gaping gates of steel and adamant  and then all passed  towers fell and
mountains slid  walls crumbled and melted  crashing down  vast spires of smoke
and spouting steams went billowing up  up  until they toppled like an
overwhelming wave  and its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the
land  and then at last over the miles between there came a rumble  rising to a
deafening crash and roar  the earth shook  the plain heaved and cracked  and
orodruin reeled  fire belched from its riven summit  the skies burst into
thunder seared with lightning  down like lashing
whips fell a torrent of black rain  and into the heart of the storm  with a cry
that pierced all other sounds  tearing the clouds asunder  the nazgûl
came  shooting like flaming bolts  as caught in the fiery ruin of hill
and sky they crackled  withered  and went out 
‘well  this is the end  sam gamgee ’ said a voice by his side  and there
was frodo  pale and worn  and yet himself again  and in his eyes there was peace
now  neither strain of will  nor madness  nor any fear  his burden was taken
away  there was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire 
‘master ’ cried sam  and fell upon his knees  in all that ruin of the
world for the moment he felt only joy  great joy  the burden was gone  his
master had been saved  he was himself again  he was free  and then sam caught
sight of the maimed and bleeding hand 
‘your poor hand ’ he said  ‘and i have nothing to bind it with  or
comfort it  i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather  but he’s gone
now beyond recall  gone for ever ’
‘yes ’ said frodo  ‘but do you remember gandalf’s words  even
gollum may have something yet to do  but for him  sam  i could not have
destroyed the ring  the quest would have been in vain  even at the bitter end 
so let us forgive him  for the quest is achieved  and now all is over  i am glad
you are here with me  here at the end of all things  sam ’
 
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged  the captains of the west were
foundering in a gathering sea  the sun gleamed red 
and under the wings of the nazgûl the shadows of death fell dark upon the
earth  aragorn stood beneath his banner  silent and stern  as one lost in
thought of things long past or far away  but his eyes gleamed like stars that
shine the brighter as the night deepens  upon the hill-top stood gandalf 
and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him  the onslaught of mordor
broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills  voices roaring like a tide amid the
wreck and crash of arms 
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given  gandalf stirred  and he
turned  looking back north where the skies were pale and clear  then he lifted
up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din  the eagles are
coming  and many voices answered crying  the eagles are coming  the
eagles are coming  the hosts of mordor looked up and wondered what this sign
might mean 
there came gwaihir the windlord  and landroval his brother  greatest of all
the eagles of the north  mightiest of the descendants of old thorondor  who
built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when
middle-earth was young  behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mountains  speeding on a gathering wind  straight down upon the
nazgûl they bore  stooping suddenly out of the high airs  and the rush of
their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale 
but the nazgûl turned and fled  and vanished into mordor’s shadows 
hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark tower  and even at that
moment all the hosts of mordor trembled  doubt clutched their hearts  their
laughter failed  their hands shook and their limbs were loosed  the power that
drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering  its will was
removed from them  and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a
deadly light and were afraid 
then all the captains of the west cried aloud  for their hearts were filled
with a new hope in the midst of darkness  out from the beleaguered hills knights
of gondor  riders of rohan  dúnedain of the
north  close-serried companies  drove against their wavering foes  piercing the
press with the thrust of bitter spears  but gandalf lifted up his arms and
called once more in a clear voice 
‘stand  men of the west  stand and wait  this is the hour of doom ’
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet  then rising swiftly
up  far above the towers of the black gate  high above the mountains  a vast
soaring darkness sprang into the sky  flickering with fire  the earth groaned
and quaked  the towers of the teeth swayed  tottered  and fell down  the mighty
rampart crumbled  the black gate was hurled in ruin  and from far away  now dim 
now growing  now mounting to the clouds  there came a drumming rumble  a roar  a
long echoing roll of ruinous noise 
‘the realm of sauron is ended ’ said gandalf  ‘the ring-bearer has
fulfilled his quest ’ and as the captains gazed south to the land of mordor 
it seemed to them that  black against the pall of cloud  there rose a huge shape
of shadow  impenetrable  lightning-crowned  filling all the sky  enormous it
reared above the world  and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand 
terrible but impotent  for even as it leaned over them  a great wind took it 
and it was all blown away  and passed  and then a hush fell 
the captains bowed their heads  and when they looked up again  behold  their
enemies were flying and the power of mordor was scattering like dust in the
wind  as when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits their
crawling hill and holds them all in sway  ants will wander witless and
purposeless and then feebly die  so the creatures of sauron  orc or troll or
beast spell-enslaved  ran hither and thither mindless  and some slew themselves 
or cast themselves in pits  or fled wailing back to
hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope  but the men of rhûn
and of harad  easterling and southron  saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory of the captains of the west  and those that were
deepest and longest in evil servitude  hating the west  and yet were men proud
and bold  in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate
battle  but the most part fled eastward as they could  and some cast their
weapons down and sued for mercy 
then gandalf  leaving all such matters of battle and command to aragorn and
the other lords  stood upon the hill-top and called  and down to him came the
great eagle  gwaihir the windlord  and stood before him 
‘twice you have borne me  gwaihir my friend ’ said gandalf  ‘thrice
shall pay for all  if you are willing  you will not find me a burden much
greater than when you bore me from zirak-zigil  where my old life burned
away ’
‘i would bear you ’ answered gwaihir  ‘whither you will  even were you
made of stone ’
‘then come  and let your brother go with us  and some other of your folk
who is most swift  for we have need of speed greater than any wind  outmatching
the wings of the nazgûl ’
‘the north wind blows  but we shall outfly it ’ said
gwaihir  and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south  and with him went
landroval  and meneldor young and swift  and they passed over udûn and
gorgoroth and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them  and before them
mount doom blazing  pouring out its fire 
‘i am glad that you are here with me ’ said frodo  ‘here at the end of
all things  sam ’
‘yes  i am with you  master ’ said sam  laying frodo’s wounded hand
gently to his breast  ‘and you’re with me  and the journey’s finished  but
after coming all that way i don’t want to give up yet  it’s not like me 
somehow  if you understand ’
‘maybe not  sam ’ said frodo  ‘but it’s like things are in the world 
hopes fail  an end comes  we have only a little time to wait now  we are lost in
ruin and downfall  and there is no escape ’
‘well  master  we could at least go further from this dangerous place here 
from this crack of doom  if that’s its name  now couldn’t we  come  mr 
frodo  let’s go down the path at any rate ’
‘very well  sam  if you wish to go  i’ll come ’ said frodo  and they
rose and went slowly down the winding road  and even as they passed towards the
mountain’s quaking feet  a great smoke and steam belched from the sammath
naur  and the side of the cone was riven open  and a huge fiery vomit rolled in
slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side 
frodo and sam could go no further  their last strength of mind and body was
swiftly ebbing  they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the mountain’s
foot  but from it there was no more escape  it was an island now  not long to
endure  amid the torment of orodruin  all about it the earth gaped  and from
deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up  behind them the mountain was
convulsed  great rents opened in its side  slow rivers of fire came down the
long slopes towards them  soon they would be engulfed  a rain of hot ash was
falling 
they stood now  and sam still holding his master’s hand caressed it  he
sighed  ‘what a tale we have been in  mr  frodo  haven’t we ’ he said 
‘i wish i could hear it told  do you think they’ll say  now comes the
story of nine-fingered frodo and the ring of doom  and then everyone will
hush  like we did  when in rivendell they told us the tale of beren one-hand and
the great jewel  i wish i could hear it  and i wonder how it will go on after
our part ’
but even while he spoke so  to keep fear away until the very last  his eyes
still strayed north  north into the eye of the wind  to where the sky far off
was clear  as the cold blast  rising to a gale  drove back the darkness and the
ruin of the clouds 


and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes  as down the
wild wind he came  and daring the great peril of the skies he circled in the
air  two small dark figures  forlorn  hand in hand upon a little hill  while the
world shook under them  and gasped  and rivers of fire drew near  and even as he
espied them and came swooping down  he saw them fall  worn out  or choked with
fumes and heat  or stricken down by despair at last  hiding their eyes from
death 
side by side they lay  and down swept gwaihir  and down came landroval and
meneldor the swift  and in a dream  not knowing what fate had befallen them  the
wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire 
when sam awoke  he found that he was lying on some soft bed  but over him
gently swayed wide beechen boughs  and through their young leaves sunlight
glimmered  green and gold  all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent 
he remembered that smell  the fragrance of ithilien  ‘bless me ’ he
mused  ‘how long have i been asleep ’ for the scent had borne him back to
the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank  and for a moment
all else between was out of waking memory  he stretched and drew a deep breath 
‘why  what a dream i’ve had ’ he muttered  ‘i am glad to wake ’ he sat
up and then he saw that frodo was lying beside him  and slept peacefully  one
hand behind his head  and the other resting upon the coverlet  it was the right
hand  and the third finger was missing 
full memory flooded back  and sam cried aloud  ‘it wasn’t a dream  then
where are we ’
and a voice spoke softly behind  ‘in the land of ithilien  and in the
keeping of the king  and he awaits you ’ with that gandalf stood before him 
robed in white  his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the
leafy sunlight  ‘well  master samwise  how do you feel ’ he said 
but sam lay back  and stared with open mouth  and for a moment  between
bewilderment and great joy  he could not answer  at last he gasped  ‘gandalf 
i thought you were dead  but then i thought i was dead myself  is everything sad
going to come untrue  what’s happened to the world ’
‘a great shadow has departed ’ said gandalf  and then he laughed and the
sound was like music  or like water in a parched land  and as he listened the
thought came to sam that he had not heard laughter  the pure sound of merriment 
for days upon days without count  it fell upon his ears like the echo of all the
joys he had ever known  but he himself burst into tears  then  as a sweet rain
will pass down a wind of spring and the sun will shine out the clearer  his
tears ceased  and his laughter welled up  and laughing he sprang from his bed 
‘how do i feel ’ he cried  ‘well  i don’t know how to say it  i feel 
i feel’ - he waved his arms in the air - ‘i feel like spring after winter 
and sun on the leaves  and like trumpets and harps and all the songs i have ever
heard ’ he stopped and he turned towards his master  ‘but how’s mr 
frodo ’ he said  ‘isn’t it a shame about his poor hand  but i hope he’s
all right otherwise  he’s had a cruel time ’
‘yes  i am all right otherwise ’ said frodo  sitting up and laughing in
his turn  i fell asleep again waiting for you  sam  you sleepyhead  i was awake
early this morning  and now it must be nearly noon ’
‘noon ’ said sam  trying to calculate  ‘noon of what day ’
‘the fourteenth of the new year ’ said gandalf  ‘or if you like  the
eighth day of april in the shire reckoning « but
in gondor the new year will always now begin upon the twenty-fifth of march when
sauron fell  and when you were brought out of the fire to the king  he has
tended you  and now he awaits you  you shall eat and drink with him  when you
are ready i will lead you to him ’
‘the king ’ said sam  ‘what king  and who is he ’
‘the king of gondor and lord of the western lands ’ said gandalf ‘and
he has taken back all his ancient realm  he will ride soon to his crowning  but
he waits for you ’
‘what shall we wear ’ said sam  for all he could see was the old and
tattered clothes that they had journeyed in  lying folded on the ground beside
their beds 
‘the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor ’ said gandalf  ‘even
the orc-rags that you bore in the black land  frodo  shall be preserved  no
silks and linens  nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable  but later
i will find some other clothes  perhaps ’
then he held out his hands to them  and they saw that one shone with light 
‘what have you got there ’ frodo cried  ‘can it be -  ’
‘yes  i have brought your two treasures  they were found on sam when you
were rescued  the lady galadriel’s gifts  your glass  frodo  and your box 
sam  you will be glad to have these safe again ’
when they were washed and clad  and had eaten a light meal  the hobbits
followed gandalf  they stepped out of the beech-grove in which they had lain 
and passed on to a long green lawn  glowing in sunshine  bordered by stately
dark-leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom  behind them they could hear the
sound of falling water  and a stream ran down before them between flowering
banks  until it came to a greenwood at the lawn’s foot and passed then on
under an archway of trees  through which they saw the shimmer of water far away 
as they came to the opening in the wood  they were surprised to see knights
in bright mail and tall guards in silver and black standing there  who greeted
them with honour and bowed before them  and then one blew a long trumpet  and
they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing stream  so they came
to a wide green land  and beyond it was a broad river in a silver haze  out of
which rose a long wooded isle  and many ships lay by its shores  but on the
field where they now stood a great host was drawn up  in ranks and companies
glittering in the sun  and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed  and
spears were shaken  and horns and trumpets sang  and men cried with many voices
and in many tongues 
‘long live the halflings  praise them with great praise 

cuio i pheriain anann  aglar’ni pheriannath 

praise them with great praise  frodo and samwise 

daur a berhael  conin en annûn  eglerio 

praise them 

eglerio 

a laita te  laita te  andave laituvalmet 

praise them 

cormacolindor  a laita tárienna 

praise them  the ring-bearers  praise them with great praise ’
and so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining with
wonder  frodo and sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host were
set three high-seats built of green turves  behind the seat upon the right
floated  white on green  a great horse running free  upon the left was a banner 
silver upon blue  a ship swan-prowed faring on the sea  but behind the highest
throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in the breeze  and there
a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and seven
glittering stars  on the throne sat a mail-clad man  a great sword was laid
across his knees  but he wore no helm  as they drew near he rose  and then they
knew him  changed as he was  so high and glad of face  kingly  lord of men 
dark-haired with eyes of grey 
frodo ran to meet him  and sam followed close behind  ‘well  if that
isn’t the crown of all ’ he said  ‘strider  or i’m still asleep ’
‘yes  sam  strider ’ said aragorn  ‘it is a long way  is it not  from
bree  where you did not like the look of me  a long way for us all but yours has
been the darkest road ’
and then to sam’s surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before
them  and taking them by the hand  frodo upon his right and sam upon his left 
he led them to the throne  and setting them upon it  he turned to the men and
captains who stood by and spoke  so that his voice rang over all the host 
crying 
‘praise them with great praise ’
and when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again  to sam’s final
and complete satisfaction and pure joy  a minstrel of gondor stood forth  and
knelt  and begged leave to sing  and behold  he said 
‘lo  lords and knights and men of valour unashamed  kings and princes  and
fair people of gondor  and riders of rohan  and ye
sons of elrond  and dúnedain of the north  and elf and dwarf  and
greathearts of the shire  and all free folk of the west  now listen to my lay 
for i will sing to you of frodo of the nine fingers and the ring of doom ’
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight  and he stood up
and cried  ‘o great glory and splendour  and all my wishes have come true ’
and then he wept 
and all the host laughed and wept  and in the midst of their merriment and
tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold  and all men
were hushed  and he sang to them  now in the elven-tongue  now in the speech of
the west  until their hearts  wounded with sweet words  overflowed  and their
joy was like swords  and they passed in thought out to regions where pain and
delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness 
and at the last  as the sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the trees
lengthened  he ended  ‘praise them with great praise ’ he said and knelt 
and then aragorn stood up  and all the host arose  and they passed to pavilions
made ready  to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted 
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent  and there their old
raiment was taken off  but folded and set aside with honour  and clean linen was
given to them  then gandalf came and in his arms  to the wonder of frodo  he
bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from
him in mordor  for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail  and his elven-cloak all
healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered  and then he laid before them
two swords 
‘i do not wish for any sword ’ said frodo 
‘tonight at least you should wear one ’ said gandalf 
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to sam  and had been laid
at his side in cirith ungol  ‘sting i gave to you sam ’ he said 
‘no  master  mr  bilbo gave it to you  and it goes with his silver coat  he
would not wish anyone else to wear it now ’
frodo gave way  and gandalf  as if he were their
esquire  knelt and girt the sword-belts about them  and then rising he set
circlets of silver upon their heads  and when they were arrayed they went to the
great feast  and they sat at the king’s table with gandalf  and king éomer
of rohan  and the prince imrahil and all the chief captains  and there
also were gimli and legolas 
but when  after the standing silence  wine was brought there came in two
esquires to serve the kings  or so they seemed to be  one was clad in the silver
and sable of the guards of minas tirith  and the other in white and green  but
sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men  then
suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly  he exclaimed 
‘why  look mr  frodo  look here  well  if it isn’t pippin  mr  peregrin
took i should say  and mr  merry  how they have grown  bless me  but i can see
there’s more tales to tell than ours ’
‘there are indeed ’ said pippin turning towards him  ‘and we’ll begin
telling them  as soon as this feast is ended  in the meantime you can try
gandalf  he’s not so close as he used to be  though he laughs now more than he
talks  for the present merry and i are busy  we are knights of the city and of
the mark  as i hope you observe ’
at last the glad day ended  and when the sun was gone and the round moon rode
slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves 
frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair
ithilien  and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf 
and after a while legolas and gimli joined them  there frodo and sam learned
much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken
on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls  and still there was always more
to ask and more to tell 
orcs  and talking trees  and leagues of grass  and galloping riders  and
glittering caves  and white towers and golden halls  and battles  and tall ships
sailing  all these passed before sam’s mind until he felt bewildered  but
amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of
merry and pippin  and he made them stand back to back with frodo and himself  he
scratched his head  ‘can’t understand it at your age ’ he said  ‘but
there it is  you’re three inches taller than you ought to he  or i’m a
dwarf ’
‘that you certainly are not ’ said gimli  ‘but what did i say  mortals
cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot
of beer ’
‘ent-draughts ’ said sam  ‘there you go about ents again  but what they
are beats me  why  it will take weeks before we get all these things sized
up ’
‘weeks indeed ’ said pippin  ‘and then frodo will have to be locked up
in a tower in minas tirith and write it all down  otherwise he will forget half
of it  and poor old bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed ’
at length gandalf rose  ‘the hands of the king are hands of healing  dear
friends ’ he said  ‘but you went to the very brink of death ere he recalled
you  putting forth all his power  and sent you into the sweet forgetfulness of
sleep  and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly  still it is now time
to sleep again ’
and not only sam and frodo here  said gimli  but you too  pippin  i love you 
if only because of the pains you have cost me  which i shall never forget  nor
shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle  but for gimli the
dwarf you would have been lost then  but at least i know now the look of a
hobbit’s foot  though it be all that can be seen under a heap of bodies  and
when i heaved that great carcase off you  i made sure you were dead  i could
have  torn out my beard  and it is only a day yet since you were first up and
abroad again  to bed now you go  and so shall i ’
‘and i ’ said legolas  ‘shall walk in the woods of this fair land 
which is rest enough  in days to come  if my elven-lord allows  some of our folk
shall remove hither  and when we come it shall be blessed  for a while  for a
while  a month  a life  a hundred years of men  but anduin is near  and anduin
leads down to the sea  to the sea 
to the sea  to the sea  the white gulls are crying 

the wind is blowing  and the white foam is flying 

west  west away  the round sun is falling 

grey ship  grey ship  do you hear them calling 

the voices of my people that have gone before me 

i will leave  i will leave the woods that bore me 

for our days are ending and our years failing 

i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing 

long are the waves on the last shore falling 

sweet are the voices in the lost isle calling 

in eressëa  in elvenhome that no man can discover 

where the leaves fall not  land of my people for ever ’
and so singing legolas went away down the hill 
then the others also departed  and frodo and sam went to their beds and
slept  and in the morning they rose again in hope
and peace  and they spent many days in ithilien  for the field of cormallen 
where the host was now encamped was near to henneth annûn  and the stream
that flowed from its falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down
through its rocky gate  and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of
anduin by the isle of cair andros  the hobbits wandered here and there visiting
again the places that they had passed before  and sam hoped always in some
shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch  maybe  a glimpse of the great
oliphaunt  and when he learned that at the siege of gondor there had been a
great number of these beasts but that they were all destroyed  he thought it a
sad loss 
‘well  one can’t be everywhere at once  i suppose ’ he said  ‘but i
missed a lot  seemingly ’
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith  the
weary rested and the hurt were healed  for some had laboured and fought much
with the remnants of the easterlings and southrons  until all were subdued  and 
latest of all  those returned who had passed into mordor and destroyed the
fortresses in the north of the land 
but at the last when the month of may was drawing near the captains of the
west set out again  and they went aboard ship with all their men  and they
sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath  and there they remained for
one day  and the day after they came to the green fields of the pelennor and saw
again the white towers under tall mindolluin  the city of the men of gondor 
last memory of westernesse  that had passed through the darkness and fire to a
new day 
and there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and awaited
the morning  for it was the eve of may  and the king would enter his gates with
the rising of the sun 
  
over the city of gondor doubt and great dread had hung  fair weather and
clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days held little hope  and who
looked each morning for news of doom  their lord was dead and burned  dead lay
the king of rohan in their citadel  and the new king that had come to them in
the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark and terrible for any
might or valour to conquer  and no news came  after the host left morgul vale
and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east 
when the captains were but two days gone  the lady éowyn bade the
women who tended her to bring her raiment  and she would not be gainsaid 
but rose  and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen  she
went to the warden of the houses of healing 
‘sir ’ she said  ‘i am in great unrest  and i cannot lie longer in
sloth ’
‘lady ’ he answered  ‘you are not yet healed  and i was commanded to
tend you with especial care  you should not have risen from your bed for seven
days yet  or so i was bidden  i beg you to go back ’
‘i am healed ’ she said  ‘healed at least in body  save my left arm
only  and that is at ease  but i shall sicken anew  if there is naught that i
can do  are there no tidings of war  the women can tell me nothing ’
‘there are no tidings ’ said the warden  ‘save that the lords have
ridden to morgul vale  and men say that the new captain out of the north is
their chief  a great lord is that  and a healer  and it is a thing passing
strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword  it is not thus
in gondor now  though once it was so  if old tales be true  but for long years
we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of swords  though
we should still have enough to do without them  the world is full enough of
hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them ’
it needs but one foe to breed a war  not two 
master warden  answered éowyn  ‘and those who have not swords can still
die upon them  would you have the folk of gondor gather you herbs only  when the
dark lord gathers armies  and it is not always good to be healed in body  nor is
it always evil to die in battle  even in bitter pain  were i permitted 
in this dark hour i would choose the latter ’
the warden looked at her  tall she stood there  her eyes bright in her white
face  her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that opened to
the east  he sighed and shook his head  after a pause she turned to him again 
‘is there no deed to do ’ she said  ‘who commands in this city ’
‘i do not rightly know ’ he answered  ‘such things are not my care 
there is a marshal over the riders of rohan  and
the lord húrin  i am told  commands the men of gondor  but the lord
faramir is by right the steward of the city ’
‘where can i find him ’
‘in this house  lady  he was sorely hurt  but is now set again on the way
to health  but i do not know-‘
‘will you not bring me to him  then you will know ’
the lord faramir was walking alone in the garden of the houses of healing 
and the sunlight warmed him  and he felt life run new in his veins  but his
heart was heavy  and he looked out over the walls
eastward  and coming  the warden spoke his name  and he turned and saw the lady
éowyn of rohan  and he was moved with pity  for he saw that she was hurt 
and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest 
‘my lord ’ said the warden  ‘here is the
lady éowyn of rohan  she rode with the king and was sorely hurt  and
dwells now in my keeping  but she is not content  and she wishes to speak to the
steward of the city ’
‘do not misunderstand him  lord ’ said éowyn  ‘it is not lack of
care that grieves me  no houses could be fairer  for those who desire to
be healed  but i cannot lie in sloth  idle  caged  i looked for death in battle 
but i have not died  and battle still goes on ’
at a sign from faramir  the warden bowed and departed  ‘what would you have
me do  lady ’ said faramir  ‘i also am a prisoner of the healers ’ he
looked at her  and being a man whom pity deeply stirred  it seemed to him that
her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart  and she looked at him and
saw the grave tenderness in his eyes  and yet knew  for she was bred among men
of war  that here was one whom no rider of the mark would outmatch in battle 
‘what do you wish ’ he said again  ‘if it lies in my power  i will do
it ’
‘i would have you command this warden  and bid him let me go ’ she said 
but though her words were still proud  her heart faltered  and for the first
time she doubted herself  she guessed that this tall man  both stern and gentle 
might think her merely wayward  like a child that has not the firmness of mind
to go on with a dull task to the end 
‘i myself am in the warden’s keeping ’ answered faramir  ‘nor have i
yet taken up my authority in the city  but had i done so  i should still listen
to his counsel  and should not cross his will in matters of his craft  unless in
some great need ’
‘but i do not desire healing ’ she said  ‘i wish to ride to war like my
brother éomer  or better like théoden the king  for he died and
has both honour and peace ’
‘it is too late  lady  to follow the captains  even if you had the
strength ’ said faramir  ‘but death in battle may come to us all yet 
willing or unwilling  you will be better prepared to face it in your own manner 
if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded  you and i  we must
endure with patience the hours of waiting ’
she did not answer  but as he looked at her it seemed to him that something
in her softened  as though a bitter frost were yielding at the first faint
presage of spring  a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her cheek  like a
glistening rain-drop  her proud head drooped a little  then quietly  more as if
speaking to herself than to him  ‘but the healers would have me lie abed seven
days yet ’ she said  ‘and my window does not look eastward ’ her voice was
now that of a maiden young and sad 
faramir smiled  though his heart was filled with pity  ‘your window does
not look eastward ’ he said  ‘that can be amended  in this i will command
the warden  if you will stay in this house in our care  lady  and take your
rest  then you shall walk in this garden in the sun  as you will  and you shall
look east  whither all our hopes have gone  and here you will find me  walking
and waiting  and also looking east  it would ease my care  if you would speak to
me  or walk at whiles with me ’
then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again  and a colour came
in her pale face  ‘how should i ease your care  my lord ’ she said  ‘and i
do not desire the speech of living men ’
‘would you have my plain answer ’ he said 
‘i would ’
‘then  éowyn of rohan  i say to you that you are beautiful 
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright  and maidens
fairer still  but neither flower nor lady have i seen till now in gondor so
lovely  and so sorrowful  it may be that only a few days are left ere darkness
falls upon our world  and when it comes i hope to face it steadily  but it would
ease my heart  if while the sun yet shines  i could see you still  for you and i
have both passed under the wings of the shadow  and the same hand drew us
back ’
‘alas  not me  lord ’ she said  ‘shadow lies on me still  look not to
me for healing  i am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle  but i thank you for
this at least  that i need not keep to my chamber  i will walk abroad by the
grace of the steward of the city ’ and she did him a courtesy and walked back
to the house  but faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden  and his
glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls 
when he returned to his chamber he called for the warden  and heard all that
he could tell of the lady of rohan 
‘but i doubt not  lord ’ said the warden  ‘that you would learn more
from the halfling that is with us  for he was in the riding of the king  and
with the lady at the end  they say ’
and so merry was sent to faramir  and while that
day lasted they talked long together  and faramir learned much  more even than
merry put into words  and he thought that he understood now something of the
grief and unrest of éowyn of rohan  and in the fair evening faramir
and merry walked in the garden  but she did not come 
but in the morning  as faramir came from the houses  he saw her  as she stood
upon the walls  and she was clad all in white  and gleamed in the sun  and he
called to her  and she came down  and they walked on the grass or sat under a
green tree together  now in silence  now in speech  and each day after they did
likewise  and the warden looking from his window was glad in heart  for he was a
healer  and his care was lightened  and certain it was that  heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of men  still these two of
his charges prospered and grew daily in strength 
and so the fifth day came since the lady éowyn went first to faramir 
and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the city and
looked out  no tidings had yet come  and all hearts were darkened  the weather 
too  was bright no longer  it was cold  a wind that had sprung up in the night
was blowing now keenly from the north  and it was rising  but the lands about
looked grey and drear 
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks  and over all the lady
éowyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer-night  and it
was set with silver stars about hem and throat  faramir had sent for this
robe and had wrapped it about her  and he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side  the mantle was wrought for his
mother  finduilas of amroth  who died untimely  and was to him but a memory of
loveliness in far days and of his first grief  and
her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of éowyn 
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle  and she looked northward 
above the grey hither lands  into the eye of the cold wind where far away the
sky was hard and clear 
‘what do you look for  éowyn ’ said faramir 
‘does not the black gate lie yonder ’ said she  ‘and must he not now be
come thither  it is seven days since he rode away ’
‘seven days ’ said faramir  ‘but think not ill of me  if i say to
you  they have brought me both a joy and a pain that i never thought to know 
joy to see you  but pain  because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are
grown dark indeed  éowyn  i would not have this world end now  or lose so
soon what i have found ’
‘lose what you have found  lord ’ she answered  but she looked at him
gravely and her eyes were kind  ‘i know not what in these days you have found
that you could lose  but come  my friend  let us not speak of it  let us not
speak at all  i stand upon some dreadful brink  and it is utterly dark in the
abyss before my feet  but whether there is any light behind me i cannot tell 
for i cannot turn yet  i wait for some stroke of doom ’
‘yes  we wait for the stroke of doom ’ said faramir  and they said no
more  and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died  and
the light failed  and the sun was bleared  and all sounds in the city or in the
lands about were hushed  neither wind  nor voice  nor bird-call  nor rustle of
leaf  nor their own breath could be heard  the very beating of their hearts was
stilled  time halted 
and as they stood so  their hands met and clasped  though they did not know
it  and still they waited for they knew not what  then presently it seemed to
them that above the ridges of the distant mountains another vast mountain of
darkness rose  towering up like a wave that should engulf the world  and about
it lightnings flickered  and then a tremor ran through the earth  and they felt
the walls of the city quiver  a sound like a sigh went up from all the lands
about them  and their hearts beat suddenly again 
‘it reminds me of númenor ’ said faramir  and wondered to hear
himself speak 
‘of númenor ’ said éowyn 
‘yes ’ said faramir  ‘of the land of westernesse that foundered and of
the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills  and
coming on  darkness unescapable  i often dream of it ’
‘then you think that the darkness is coming ’ said éowyn 
‘darkness unescapable ’ and suddenly she drew close to him 
‘no ’ said faramir  looking into her face  ‘it was but a picture in the
mind  i do not know what is happening  the reason of my waking mind tells me
that great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days  but my heart says
nay  and all my limbs are light  and a hope and joy
are come to me that no reason can deny  éowyn  éowyn  white lady
of rohan  in this hour i do not believe that any darkness will endure ’ and he
stooped and kissed her brow 
and so they stood on the walls of the city of gondor  and a great wind rose
and blew  and their hair  raven and golden  streamed out mingling in the air 
and the shadow departed  and the sun was unveiled  and light leaped forth  and
the waters of anduin shone like silver  and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what source they could not
tell 
and before the sun had fallen far from the noon out of the east there came a
great eagle flying  and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of the west 
crying 
sing now  ye people of the tower of anor 

for the realm of sauron is ended for ever 

and the dark tower is thrown down 



sing and rejoice  ye people of the tower of guard 

for your watch hath not been in vain 

and the black gate is broken 

and your king hath passed through 

and he is victorious 



sing and be glad  all ye children of the west 

for your king shall come again 

and he shall dwell among you

all the days of your life 



and the tree that was withered shall be renewed 

and he shall plant it in the high places 

and the city shall be blessed 



sing all ye people 
and the people sang in all the ways of the city 
the days that followed were golden  and spring and summer joined and made
revel together in the fields of gondor  and tidings now came by swift riders
from cair andros of all that was done  and the city made ready for the coming of
the king  merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of
goods to osgiliath and thence by ship to cair andros  but faramir did not go 
for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the stewardship 
although it was only for a little while  and his duty was to prepare for one who
should replace him 
and éowyn did not go  though her brother sent word begging her to come
to the field of cormallen  and faramir wondered at this  but he saw her
seldom  being busy with many matters  and she dwelt still in the houses of
healing and walked alone in the garden  and her face grew pale again  and it
seemed that in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful  and the warden of
the houses was troubled  and he spoke to faramir 
then faramir came and sought her  and once more they stood on the walls
together  and he said to her  ‘éowyn  why do you tarry here  and do not
go to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros  where your brother
awaits you ’
and she said  ‘do you not know ’
but he answered  ‘two reasons there may be  but which is true  l do not
know ’
and she said  ‘i do not wish to play at riddles  speak plainer ’
‘then if you will have it so  lady ’ he said  ‘you do not go  because
only your brother called for you  and to look on the lord aragorn  elendil’s
heir  in his triumph would now bring you no joy  or because i do not go  and you
desire still to be near me  and maybe for both these reasons 
and you yourself cannot choose between them  éowyn  do you not love me 
or will you not ’
‘i wished to be loved by another ’ she answered  ‘but i desire no
man’s pity ’
‘that i know ’ he said  ‘you desired to have the love of the lord
aragorn  because he was high and puissant  and you wished to have renown and
glory and to be lifted far above the mean things that crawl on the earth  and as
a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable  for so he is 
a lord among men  the greatest that now is  but
when he gave you only understanding and pity  then you desired to have nothing 
unless a brave death in battle  look at me  éowyn ’
and éowyn looked at faramir long and steadily  and faramir said  ‘do
not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart  éowyn  but i do not
offer you my pity  for you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won
renown that shall not be forgotten  and you are a lady beautiful  i deem  beyond
even the words of the elven-tongue to tell  and i love you  once i pitied your
sorrow  but now  were you sorrowless  without fear or any lack  were you the
blissful queen of gondor  still i would love you  éowyn  do you not love
me ’
then the heart of éowyn changed  or else at last she understood it 
and suddenly her winter passed  and the sun shone on her 
i stand in minas anor  the tower of the sun  she said  and behold the shadow
has departed  i will be a shieldmaiden no longer  nor vie with the great riders 
nor take joy only in the songs of slaying  i will be a healer  and love all
things that grow and are not barren ’ and again she looked at faramir  ‘no
longer do i desire to be a queen ’ she said 
then faramir laughed merrily  ‘that is well ’ he said  ‘for i am not a
king  yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan  if it be her will  and if she
will  then let us cross the river and in happier days let us dwell in fair
ithilien and there make a garden  all things will grow with joy there  if the
white lady comes ’
‘then must i leave my own people  man of gondor ’ she said  ‘and would
you have your proud folk say of you  “there goes
a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of the north  was there no woman of the
race of númenor to choose ”’
‘i would ’ said faramir  and he took her in his arms and kissed her under
the sunlit sky  and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the
sight of many  and many indeed saw them and the light that shone about them as
they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the houses of healing 
and to the warden of the houses faramir said 
‘here is the lady éowyn of rohan  and now she is healed ’
and the warden said  ‘then i release her from my charge and bid her
farewell  and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again  i commend her to the
care of the steward of the city  until her brother returns ’
but éowyn said  ‘yet now that i have leave to depart  i would
remain  for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed ’
and she remained there until king éomer came 
all things were now made ready in the city  and there was great concourse of
people  for the tidings had gone out into all parts of gondor  from min-rimmon
even to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea  and all that could come to
the city made haste to come  and the city was filled again with women and fair
children that returned to their homes laden with flowers  and from dol amroth
came the harpers that harped most skilfully in all the land  and there were
players upon viols and upon flutes and upon horns of silver  and clear-voiced
singers from the vales of lebennin 
at last an evening came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen upon
the field  and all night lights were burning as men watched for the dawn  and
when the sun rose in the clear morning above the mountains in the east  upon
which shadows lay no more  then all the bells rang  and all the banners broke
and flowed in the wind  and upon the white tower of the citadel the standard of
the stewards  bright argent like snow in the sun  bearing no charge nor device 
was raised over gondor for the last time 
now the captains of the west led their host towards the city  and folk saw
them advance in line upon line  flashing and glinting in the sunrise and
rippling like silver  and so they came before the gateway and halted a furlong
from the walls  as yet no gates had been set up
again  but a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city  and there stood
men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn  before the barrier stood
faramir the steward  and húrin warden of the keys  and other captains of
gondor  and the lady éowyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many
knights of the mark  and upon either side of the gate was a great press of fair
people in raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers 
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith  and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the
soldiers of gondor and of rohan  and by the people of the city and of all parts
of the land  a hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the dúnedain
in silver and grey  and before them came walking slow the lord aragorn 
he was clad in black mail girt with silver  and he wore a long mantle of pure
white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar 
but his head was bare save for a star upon his
forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver  with him were éomer of
rohan  and the prince imrahil  and gandalf robed all in white  and four small
figures that many men marvelled to see 
‘nay  cousin  they are not boys ’ said ioreth to her kinswoman from
imloth melui  who stood beside her  ‘those are periain  out of the far
country of the halflings  where they are princes of great fame  it is said  i
should know  for i had one to tend in the houses  they are small  but they are
valiant  why  cousin  one of them went with only his esquire into the black
country and fought with the dark lord all by himself  and set fire to his tower 
if you can believe it  at least that is the tale in the city  that will be the
one that walks with our elfstone  they are dear friends  i hear  now he is a
marvel  the lord elfstone  not too soft in his speech  mind you  but he has a
golden heart  as the saying is  and he has the healing hands  “the hands of
the king are the hands of a healer”  i said  and that was how it was all
discovered  and mithrandir  he said to me  “ioreth  men will long remember
your words”  and-‘
but ioreth was not permitted to continue the instruction of her kinswoman
from the country  for a single trumpet rang  and a dead silence followed  then
forth from the gate went faramir with húrin of the keys  and no others 
save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and armour of the
citadel  and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound
with silver 
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled  and he knelt  and
said  ‘the last steward of gondor begs leave to surrender his office ’ and
he held out a white rod  but aragorn took the rod and gave it back  saying 
‘that office is not ended  and it shall be thine and thy heirs’ as long as
my line shall last  do now thy office ’
then faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice  ‘men of gondor hear now
the steward of this realm  behold  one has come to claim the kingship again at
last  here is aragorn son of arathorn  chieftain of
the dúnedain of arnor  captain of the host of the west  bearer of the
star of the north  wielder of the sword reforged  victorious in battle  whose
hands bring healing  the elfstone  elessar of the line of valandil  isildur’s
son  elendil’s son of númenor  shall he be king and enter into
the city and dwell there ’
and all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice 
and ioreth said to her kinswoman  ‘this is just a ceremony such as we have
in the city  cousin  for he has already entered  as i was telling you  and he
said to me-‘ and then again she was obliged to silence  for faramir spoke
again 
‘men of gondor  the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that the
king should receive the crown from his father ere he died  or if that might not
be  that he should go alone and take it from the hands of his father in the tomb
where he was laid  but since things must now be done otherwise  using the
authority of the steward  i have today brought hither from rath dínen the
crown of eärnur the last king  whose days passed in the time of our
longfathers of old ’
then the guards stepped forward  and faramir opened the casket  and he held
up an ancient crown  it was shaped like the helms of the guards of the citadel 
save that it was loftier  and it was all white  and the wings at either side
were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of a sea-bird  for
it was the emblem of kings who came over the sea  and seven gems of adamant were
set in the circlet  and upon its summit was set a single jewel the light of
which went up like a flame 
then aragorn took the crown and held it up and said 
et eärello endorenna utúlien  sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn’
ambar-metta 
and those were the words that elendil spoke when he came up out of the sea on
the wings of the wind  ‘out of the great sea to middle-earth i am come  in
this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world ’
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not put the crown upon his head  but
gave it back to faramir  and said  ‘by the labour and valour of many i have
come into my inheritance  in token of this i would have the ring-bearer bring
the crown to me  and let mithrandir set it upon my head  if he will  for he has
been the mover of all that has been accomplished  and this is his victory ’
then frodo came forward and took the crown from faramir and bore it to
gandalf  and aragorn knelt  and gandalf set the white crown upon his head  and
said 
‘now come the days of the king  and may they be blessed while the thrones
of the valar endure ’
but when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence  for it seemed to
them that he was revealed to them now for the first time  tall as the sea-kings
of old  he stood above all that were near  ancient of days he seemed and yet in
the flower of manhood  and wisdom sat upon his brow  and strength and healing
were in his hands  and a light was about him  and then faramir cried 
‘behold the king ’
and in that moment all the trumpets were blown  and the king elessar went
forth and came to the barrier  and húrin of
the keys thrust it back  and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and
the singing of clear voices the king passed through the flower-laden streets 
and came to the citadel  and entered in  and the banner of the tree and
the stars was unfurled upon the topmost tower  and the reign of king elessar
began  of which many songs have told 
in his time the city was made more fair than it had ever been  even in the
days of its first glory  and it was filled with trees and with fountains  and
its gates were wrought of mithril and steel  and its streets were paved with
white marble  and the folk of the mountain laboured in it  and the folk of the
wood rejoiced to come there  and all was healed and made good  and the houses
were filled with men and women and the laughter of children  and no window was
blind nor any courtyard empty  and after the ending of the third age of the
world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that
were gone 
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat on his throne in the hall
of the kings and pronounced his judgements  and embassies came from many lands
and peoples  from the east and the south  and from the borders of mirkwood  and
from dunland in the west  and the king pardoned the
easterlings that had given themselves up  and sent them away free  and he made
peace with the peoples of harad  and the slaves of mordor he released and gave
to them all the lands about lake núrnen to be their own  and there were
brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their
valour  and last the captain of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged 
and the king said to beregond  ‘beregond  by your sword blood was spilled
in the hallows  where that is forbidden  also you left your post without leave
of lord or of captain  for these things  of old  death was the penalty  now
therefore i must pronounce your doom 
‘all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle  and still more because
all that you did was for the love of the lord faramir  nonetheless you must
leave the guard of the citadel  and you must go forth from the city of minas
tirith ’
then the blood left beregond’s face  and he was stricken to the heart and
bowed his head  but the king said  
‘so it must be  for you are appointed to the white company  the guard of
faramir  prince of ithilien  and you shall be its captain and dwell in emyn
arnen in honour and peace  and in the service of him for whom you risked all  to
save him from death ’
and then beregond  perceiving the mercy and justice of the king  was glad 
and kneeling kissed his hand  and departed in joy and content  and aragorn gave
to faramir ithilien to be his princedom  and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn
arnen within sight of the city 
‘for ’ said he  ‘minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed 
and though it may in time to come be made clean  no man may dwell there for many
long years ’
and last of all aragorn greeted éomer of rohan  and they embraced  and
aragorn said  ‘between us there can be no word of giving or taking  nor
of reward  for we are brethren  in happy hour did eorl ride from the north  and
never has any league of peoples been more blessed  so that neither has ever
failed the other  nor shall fail  now  as you know  we
have laid théoden the renowned in a tomb in the hallows  and there he
shall lie for ever among the kings of gondor  if you will  or if you desire it 
we will come to rohan and bring him back to rest with his own people ’
and éomer answered  ‘since the day when you rose before me
out of the green grass of the downs i have loved you  and that love shall not
fail  but now i must depart for a while to my own realm  where there is much to
heal and set in order  but as for the fallen  when all is made ready we will
return for him  but here let him sleep a while ’
and éowyn said to faramir  ‘now i must go back to my own land and
look on it once again  and help my brother in his labour  but when one whom i
long loved as father is laid at last to rest  i will return ’
so the glad days passed  and on the eighth day of may the riders of rohan
made ready  and rode off by the north-way  and with them went the sons of
elrond  all the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them 
from the gate of the city to the walls of the pelennor  then all others that
dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing  but in the city there was labour
of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war
and the memory of the darkness 
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith  with legolas and gimli  for
aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved  ‘at last all such things
must end ’ he said  ‘but i would have you wait a little while longer  for
the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come  a day draws near
that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood  and when it comes i would
have my friends beside me ’ but of that day he would say no more 
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house with
gandalf  and they went to and fro as they wished  and frodo said to gandalf 
‘do you know what this day is that aragorn speaks of  for we are happy here 
and i don’t wish to go  but the days are running away  and bilbo is waiting 
and the shire is my home ’
‘as for bilbo ’ said gandalf  ‘he is waiting for the same day  and he
knows what keeps you  and as for the passing of the days  it is now only may and
high summer is not yet in  and though all things may seem changed  as if an age
of the world had gone by  yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year
since you set out ’
‘pippin ’ said frodo  ‘didn’t you say that gandalf was less close
than of old  he was weary of his labours then  i think  now he is recovering ’
and gandalf said  ‘many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on
the table  but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their
secret  for wonder makes the words of praise louder  and aragorn himself waits
for a sign ’
there came a day when gandalf could not be found  and the companions wondered
what was going forward  but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night  and
he brought him to the southern feet of mount mindolluin  and there they found a
path made in ages past that few now dared to tread  for it led up on to the
mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go  and they
went up by steep ways  until they came to a high field below the snows that clad
the lofty peaks  and it looked down over the precipice that stood behind the
city  and standing there they surveyed the lands  for the morning was come  and
they saw the towers of the city far below them like white pencils touched by the
sunlight  and all the vale of anduin was like a garden  and the mountains of
shadow were veiled in a golden mist  upon the one side their sight reached to
the grey emyn muil  and the glint of rauros was like a star twinkling far off 
and upon the other side they saw the river like a ribbon laid down to pelargir 
and beyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the sea 
and gandalf said  ‘this is your realm  and the heart of the greater realm
that shall be  the third age of the world is ended  and the new age is begun 
and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may be
preserved  for though much has been saved  much must now pass away  and the
power of the three rings also is ended  and all the lands that you see  and
those that lie round about them  shall be dwellings of men  for the time comes
of the dominion of men  and the elder kindred shall fade or depart ’
‘i know it well  dear friend ’ said aragorn  ‘but i would still have
your counsel ’
‘not for long now ’ said gandalf  ‘the third age was my age  i was the
enemy of sauron  and my work is finished  i shall go soon  the burden must lie
now upon you and your kindred ’
‘but i shall die ’ said aragorn  ‘for i am a mortal man  and though
being what i am and of the race of the west unmingled  i shall have life far
longer than other men  yet that is but a little while  and when those who are
now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old  i too shall grow old  and
who then shall govern gondor and those who look to this city as to their queen 
if my desire be not granted  the tree in the court of the fountain is still
withered and barren  when shall i see a sign that it will ever be otherwise ’
‘turn your face from the green world  and look where all seems barren and
cold ’ said gandalf 
then aragorn turned  and there was a stony slope behind him running down from
the skirts of the snow  and as he looked he was aware that alone there in the
waste a growing thing stood  and he climbed to it  and saw that out of the very
edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than three foot high 
already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely  dark above and silver
beneath  and upon its slender crown it bore one small cluster of flowers whose
white petals shone like the sunlit snow 
then aragorn cried  ‘yé  utúvienyes 
i have found it  lo  here is a scion of the eldest of trees  but how comes it
here  for it is not itself yet seven years old ’
and gandalf coming looked at it  and said  ‘verily this is a sapling of the
line of nimloth the fair  and that was a seedling of galathilion  and that a
fruit of telperion of many names  eldest of trees  who shall say how it comes
here in the appointed hour  but this is an ancient hallow  and ere the kings
failed or the tree withered in the court  a fruit must have been set here  for
it is said that  though the fruit of the tree comes seldom to ripeness  yet the
life within may then lie sleeping through many long years  and none can foretell
the time in which it will awake  remember this  for if ever a fruit ripens  it
should be planted  lest the line die out of the world  here it has lain  hidden
on the mountain  even as the race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the
north  yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line  king elessar ’
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling  and lo  it seemed to hold
only lightly to the earth  and it was removed
without hurt  and aragorn bore it back to the citadel  then the withered tree
was uprooted  but with reverence  and they did not burn it  but laid it to rest
in the silence of rath dínen  and aragorn planted the new tree in
the court by the fountain  and swiftly and gladly it began to grow  and when the
month of june entered in it was laden with blossom 
‘the sign has been given ’ said aragorn  ‘and the day is not far
off ’ and he set watchmen upon the walls 
it was the day before midsummer when messengers came from amon din to the
city  and they said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the north  and
they drew near now to the walls of the pelennor  and the king said  ‘at last
they have come  let all the city be made ready ’
upon the very eve of midsummer  when the sky was blue as sapphire and white
stars opened in the east  but the west was still golden and the air was cool and
fragrant  the riders came down the north-way to the gates of minas tirith  first
rode elrohir and elladan with a banner of silver 
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household of rivendell  and
after them came the lady galadriel and celeborn  lord of lothlórien 
riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land 
grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair  and last came master elrond  mighty
among elves and men  bearing the sceptre of annúminas  and beside him
upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter  evenstar of her people 
and frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening  with stars on her
brow and a sweet fragrance about her  was moved with great wonder  and he said
to gandalf  ‘at last i understand why we have waited  this is the ending  now
not day only shall be beloved  but night too shall be beautiful and blessed and
all its fear pass away ’
then the king welcomed his guests  and they alighted  and elrond surrendered
the sceptre  and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the king  and
together they went up into the high city  and all the stars
flowered in the sky  and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undómiel
in the city of the kings upon the day of midsummer  and the tale of their long
waiting and labours was come to fulfilment 
 
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the companions thought of
returning to their own homes  and frodo went to the king as he was sitting with
the queen arwen by the fountain  and she sang a song of valinor  while the tree
grew and blossomed  they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him  and aragorn said 
‘i know what you have come to say  frodo  you wish to return to your own
home  well  dearest friend  the tree grows best in the land of its sires  but
for you in all the lands of the west there will ever be a welcome  and though
your people have had little fame in the legends of the great  they will now have
more renown than any wide realms that are no more ’
‘it is true that i wish to go back to the shire ’ said frodo  ‘but
first i must go to rivendell  for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed  i missed bilbo  and i was grieved when among all the household of
elrond i saw that he was not come ’
‘do you wonder at that  ring-bearer ’ said arwen  ‘for you know the
power of that thing which is now destroyed  and all that was done by that power
is now passing away  but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you  he
is ancient in years now  according to his kind  and he awaits you  for he will
not again make any long journey save one ’
‘then i beg leave to depart soon ’ said frodo 
‘in seven days we will go ’ said aragorn  ‘for we shall ride with you
far on the road  even as far as the country of rohan  in three days now éomer
will return hither to bear théoden back to rest in the mark  and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen  but now before you go i will confirm
the words that faramir spoke to you  and you are made free for ever of the realm
of gondor  and all your companions likewise  and if there were any gifts that i
could give to match with your deeds you should have them  but whatever you
desire you shall take with you  and you shall ride in honour and arrayed as
princes of the land ’
but the queen arwen said  ‘a gift i will give you  for i am the daughter of
elrond  i shall not go with him now when he departs
to the havens  for mine is the choice of lúthien  and as she so have i
chosen  both the sweet and the bitter  but in my stead you shall go 
ring-bearer  when the time comes  and if you then desire it  if your hurts
grieve you still and the memory of your burden is heavy  then you may
pass into the west  until all your wounds and weariness are healed  but wear
this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar with whom your life has been
woven ’
and she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging upon a
silver chain  and she set the chain about frodo’s neck  ‘when the memory of
the fear and the darkness troubles you ’ she said  ‘this will bring you
aid ’
in three days  as the king had said  éomer of rohan came riding to the
city  and with him came an éored
of the fairest knights of the mark  he was welcomed  and when they sat all at
table in merethrond  the great hall of feasts  he beheld the beauty of the
ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder  and before he went to his
rest he sent for gimli the dwarf  and he said to
him  ‘gimli glóin’s son  have you your axe ready ’
‘nay  lord ’ said gimli  ‘but i can speedily fetch it  if there be
need ’
‘you shall judge ’ said éomer  ‘for there are certain rash words
concerning the lady in the golden wood that lie still between us  and now
i have seen her with my eyes ’
‘well  lord ’ said gimli  ‘and what say you now ’
‘alas ’ said éomer  ‘i will not say that she is the fairest lady
that lives ’
‘then i must go for my axe ’ said gimli 
‘but first i will plead this excuse ’ said
éomer  ‘had i seen her in other company  i would have said all that you
could wish  but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first  and i am ready to do
battle on my own part with any who deny me  shall i call for my sword ’
then gimli bowed low  ‘nay  you are excused for my part  lord ’ he said 
‘you have chosen the evening  but my love is given to the morning  and my
heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever ’
at last the day of departure came  and a great and fair
company made ready to ride north from the city  then the kings of gondor and
rohan went to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath dínen  and
they bore away king théoden upon a golden bier  and passed through the
city in silence  then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan
all about it and his banner borne before  and merry being théoden’s
esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king 
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature 
and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side  and gandalf rode upon shadowfax 
and pippin rode with the knights of gondor  and legolas and gimli as ever rode
together upon arod 
in that riding went also queen arwen  and celeborn and galadriel with their
folk  and elrond and his sons  and the princes of
dol amroth and of ithilien  and many captains and knights  never had any king of
the mark such company upon the road as went with théoden thengel’s son
to the land of his home 
without haste and at peace they passed into anórien 
and they came to the grey wood under amon din  and there they heard a
sound as of drums beating in the hills  though no living thing could be seen 
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown  and heralds cried 
‘behold the king elessar is come  the forest
of drúadan he gives to ghân-buri-ghân and to his folk  to be
their own for ever  and hereafter let no man enter it without their leave ’
then the drums rolled loudly  and were silent 
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of king théoden
passed through the green fields of rohan and came to edoras  and there they all
rested  the golden hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled with
light  and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the days of
its building  for after three days the men of the
mark prepared the funeral of théoden  and he was laid in a house of stone
with his arms and many other fair things that he had possessed  and over him was
raised a great mound  covered with green turves of grass and of white
evermind  and now there were eight mounds on the east-side of the barrowfield 
then the riders of the king’s house upon white horses rode round about the
barrow and sang together a song of théoden thengel’s son that gléowine
his minstrel made  and he made no other song after  the slow voices of
the riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that
people  but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the
mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves
of the north and the voice of eorl crying above the battle upon the field of
celebrant  and the tale of the kings rolled on  and the horn of helm was loud in
the mountains  until the darkness came and king théoden arose and rode
through the shadow to the fire  and died in splendour  even as the sun 
returning beyond hope  gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning 
out of doubt  out of dark  to the day’s rising

he rode singing in the sun  sword unsheathing 

hope he rekindled  and in hope ended 

over death  over dread  over doom lifted

out of loss  out of life  unto long glory 
but merry stood at the foot of the green mound  and he wept  and when the
song was ended he arose and cried 
‘théoden king  théoden king  farewell  as a father you were
to me  for a little while  farewell ’
when the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled  and théoden
was left at last alone in his barrow  then folk gathered to the golden hall for
the great feast and put away sorrow  for théoden had lived to full years
and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires  and when the time
came that in the custom of the mark they should drink to the memory of the
kings  éowyn lady of rohan came forth  golden as the sun and white as
snow  and she bore a filled cup to éomer 
then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the lords
of the mark in their order  eorl the young  and brego builder of the hall  and
aldor brother of baldor the hapless  and fréa  and fréawine  and
goldwine  and déor  and gram  and helm who lay hid in helm’s deep when
the mark was overrun  and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side  for in that
time the line was broken  and after came the mounds of the east-side  fréalaf 
helm s sister-son  and léofa  and walda  and folca  and folcwine  and
fengel  and thengel  and théoden the latest  and when théoden was
named éomer drained the cup  then éowyn bade those that served to
fill the cups  and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king  crying 
‘hail  éomer  king of the mark ’
at the last when the feast drew to an end éomer arose and said  ‘now
this is the funeral feast of théoden the king  but i will speak ere we go
of tidings of joy  for he would not grudge that i should do so  since he was
ever a father of éowyn my sister  hear then all my guests  fair folk of
many realms  such as have never before been gathered in this hall  faramir 
steward of gondor  and prince of ithilien  asks that éowyn lady of rohan
should be his wife  and she grants it full willing  therefore they shall
be trothplighted before you all ’
and faramir and éowyn stood forth and set hand in hand  and all there
drank to them and were glad  ‘thus ’ said éomer  ‘is the friendship
of the mark and of gondor bound with a new bond  and the more do i rejoice ’
‘no niggard are you  éomer ’ said
aragorn  ‘to give thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm ’
then éowyn looked in the eyes of aragorn  and she said  ‘wish me
joy  my liege-lord and healer ’
and he answered  ‘i have wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee  it
heals my heart to see thee now in bliss ’
when the feast was over  those who were to go took leave of king éomer 
aragorn and his knights  and the people of lórien and of rivendell  made
ready to ride  but faramir and imrahil remained at edoras  and arwen
evenstar remained also  and she said farewell to her brethren  none saw her last
meeting with elrond her father  for they went up into the hills and there spoke
long together  and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends
of the world 
at the last before the guests set oat éomer and éowyn came to
merry  and they said  ‘farewell now  meriadoc of the shire and holdwine of the
mark  ride to good fortune  and ride back soon to our welcome ’
and éomer said  ‘kings of old would have laden you with gifts
that a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of mundburg  and yet
you will take naught  you say  but the arms that were given to you  this i
suffer  for indeed i have no gift that is worthy  but my sister begs you to
receive this small thing  as a memorial of dernhelm and of the horns of the mark
at the coming of the morning ’
then éowyn gave to merry an ancient horn  small but cunningly wrought
all of fair silver with a baldric of green  and wrights had engraven upon it swift
horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the mouth  and
there were set runes of great virtue 
‘this is an heirloom of our house ’ said éowyn  ‘it was made by
the dwarves  and came from the hoard of scatha the worm  eorl the young
brought it from the north  he that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts
of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends  and they shall hear him and
come to him ’
then merry took the horn  for it could not be refused  and he kissed éowyn’s
hand  and they embraced him  and so they parted for that time 
now the guests were ready  and they drank the stirrup-cup  and with great
praise and friendship they departed  and came at length to helm’s deep  and
there they rested two days  then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went
with him to the glittering caves  and when they returned he was silent  and
would say only that gimli alone could find fit words to speak of them  ‘and
never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over an elf in a contest of words ’
said he  ‘now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the score right ’
from deeping-coomb they rode to isengard  and saw how the ents had busied
themselves  all the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed  and the land
within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees  and a stream ran
through it  but in the midst of all there was a lake of clear water  and out of
it the tower of orthanc rose still  tall and impregnable  and its black rock was
mirrored in the pool 
for a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of isengard had
stood  and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a
green-bordered path that ran towards orthanc  and they looked in wonder at the
work that had been done  but no living thing could they see far or near  but
presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom  hoom-hom  and there
came treebeard striding down the path to greet them with quickbeam at his side 
‘welcome to the treegarth of orthanc ’ he said  ‘i knew that you were
coming  but i was at work up the valley  there is much still to be done  but you
have not been idle either away in the south and the east  i hear  and all that i
hear is good  very good ’ then treebeard praised all their deeds  of which he
seemed to have full knowledge  and at last he stopped and looked long at
gandalf 
‘well  come now ’ he said  ‘you have proved mightiest  and all your
labours have gone well  where now would you be going  and why do you come
here ’
‘to see how your work goes  my friend ’ said gandalf  ‘and to thank you
for your aid in all that has been achieved ’
‘hoom
‘and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out on
the wold  for they had not heard of us before  though that might be said also of
better folk  and not many will remember us  for not many escaped us alive  and
the river had most of those  but it was well for you  for if they had not met
us  then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far  and if he had
there would have been no home to return to ’
‘we know it well ’ said aragorn  ‘and never shall it be forgotten in
minas tirith or in edoras ’
‘never is too long a word even for me ’ said treebeard  ‘not
while your kingdoms last  you mean  but they will have to last long indeed to
seem long to ents ’
‘the new age begins ’ said gandalf  ‘and in this age it may well prove
that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you  fangorn my friend  but now come tell
me  what of the task that i set you  how is saruman  is he not weary of orthanc
yet  for i do not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from his
windows ’
treebeard gave gandalf a long look  a most cunning look  merry thought 
‘ah ’ he said  ‘i thought you would come to that  weary of orthanc  very
weary at last  but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice  hoom 
i gave him some long tales  or at least what might be thought long in your
speech ’
‘then why did he stay to listen  did you go into orthanc ’ asked gandalf 
‘hoom
‘l observe  my good fangorn ’ said gandalf  ‘that with great care you
say dwelt  was  grew  what about is  is he dead ’
‘no  not dead  so far as i know ’ said treebeard  ‘but he is gone  yes 
he is gone seven days  i let him go  there was little left of him when he
crawled out  and as for that worm-creature of his  he was like a pale shadow 
now do not tell me  gandalf  that i promised to keep him safe  for i know it 
but things have changed since then  and i kept him until he was safe  safe from
doing any more harm  you should know that above all i hate the caging of live
things  and i will not keep even such creatures as these caged beyond great
need  a snake without fangs may crawl where he will ’
‘you may be right ’ said gandalf  ‘but this snake had still one tooth
left  i think  he had the poison of his voice  and i guess that he persuaded
you  even you treebeard  knowing the soft spot in your heart  well  he is gone 
and there is no more to be said  but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
king  to whom it belongs  though maybe he will not need it ’
‘that will be seen later ’ said aragorn  ‘but i will give to ents all
this valley to do with as they will  so long as they keep a watch upon orthanc
and see that none enter it without my leave ’
‘it is locked ’ said treebeard  ‘i made saruman lock it and give me the
keys  quickbeam has them ’
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to aragorn two
great black keys of intricate shape  joined by a ring of steel  ‘now i thank
you once more ’ said aragorn  ‘and i bid you farewell  may your forest grow
again in peace  when this valley is filled there is room and to spare west of
the mountains  where once you walked long ago ’
treebeard’s face became sad  ‘forests may grow ’ he said  ‘woods may
spread  but not ents  there are no entings ’
‘yet maybe there is now more hope in your search ’ said aragorn  ‘lands
will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed ’
but treebeard shook his head and said  ‘it is far to go  and there are too
many men there in these days  but i am forgetting my manners  will you stay here
and rest a while  and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through
fangorn forest and so shorten their road home ’ he looked at celeborn and
galadriel 
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart 
either south or west  ‘come  gimli ’ said legolas  ‘now by fangorn’s
leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are
nowhere else to be found in middle-earth  you shall come with me and keep your
word  and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and
beyond ’ to this gimli agreed  though with no great delight  it seemed 
‘here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the ring ’ said
aragorn  ‘yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help
that you promised ’
‘we will come  if our own lords allow it ’ said gimli  ‘well  farewell 
my hobbits  you should come safe to your own homes now  and i shall not be kept
awake for fear of your peril  we will send word when we may  and some of us may
yet meet at times  but i fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever
again ’
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn  and he bowed three
times slowly and with great reverence to celeborn and galadriel  ‘it is long 
long since we met by stock or by stone  a vanimar  vanimálion
nostari ’ he said  ‘it is sad that we should meet only thus at the
ending  for the world is changing  i feel it in the water  i feel it in the
earth  and i smell it in the air  i do not think we shall meet again ’
and celeborn said  ‘i do not know  eldest ’ but galadriel said  ‘not in
middle-earth  nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again 
then in the willow-meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring  farewell ’
last of all merry and pippin said good-bye to the old ent  and he grew gayer
as he looked at them  ‘well  my merry folk ’ he said  ‘will you drink
another draught with me before you go ’
‘indeed we will ’ they said  and he took them aside into the shade of one
of the trees  and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set  and
treebeard filled three bowls  and they drank  and they saw his strange eyes
looking at them over the rim of his bowl  ‘take care take care ’ he said 
‘for you have already grown since i saw you last ’ and they laughed and
drained their bowls 
‘well  good-bye ’ he said  ‘and don’t forget that if you hear any
news of the entwives in your land  you will send word to me ’ then he waved
his great hands to all the company and went off into the trees 


the travellers now rode with more speed  and they made their way towards the gap
of rohan  and aragorn took leave of them at last close to that very place where
pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc  the hobbits were grieved at this
parting  for aragorn had never failed them and he had been their guide through
many perils 
‘i wish we could have a stone that we could see all our friends in ’ said
pippin  ‘and that we could speak to them from far away ’
‘only one now remains that you could use ’ answered aragorn
for you would not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you  but
the palantír of orthanc the king will keep  to see what is passing in his
realm  and what his servants are doing  for do not forget  peregrin took  that
you are a knight of gondor  and i do not release you from your service 
you are going now on leave  but i may recall you  and remember  dear friends of
the shire  that my realm lies also in the north  and i shall come there one
day ’
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel  and the lady said to him 
‘elfstone  through darkness you have come to your hope  and have now all your
desire  use well the days ’
but celeborn said  ‘kinsman  farewell  may your doom be other than mine 
and your treasure remain with you to the end ’
with that they parted  and it was then the time of sunset  and when after a
while they turned and looked back  they saw the king of the west sitting upon
his horse with his knights about him  and the falling sun shone upon them and
made all their harness to gleam like red gold  and the white mantle of aragorn
was turned to a flame  then aragorn took the green stone and held it up  and
there came a green fire from his hand 
soon the dwindling company  following the isen  turned west and rode through
the gap into the waste lands beyond  and then they turned northwards  and passed
over the borders of dunland  the dunlendings fled and hid themselves  for they
were afraid of elvish folk  though few indeed ever came to their country  but
the travellers did not heed them  for they were still a great company and were
well provided with all that they needed  and they went on their way at their
leisure  setting up their tents when they would 
on the sixth day since their parting from the king they journeyed through a
wood climbing down from the hills at the feet of the misty mountains that now
marched on their right hand  as they came out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff  and he was clothed in rags
of grey or dirty white  and at his heels went another beggar  slouching and
whining 
‘well saruman ’ said gandalf  ‘where are you going ’
‘what is that to you ’ he answered  ‘will you still order my goings 
and are you not content with my ruin ’
‘you know the answers ’ said gandalf  ‘no and no  but in any case the
time of my labours now draws to an end  the king has taken on the burden  if you
had waited at orthanc  you would have seen him  and he would have shown you
wisdom and mercy ’
‘then all the à more reason to have left sooner ’ said
saruman  ‘for i desire neither of him  indeed if you wish for an answer to
your first question  i am seeking a way out of his realm ’
‘then once more you are going the wrong way ’ said gandalf  ‘and i see
no hope in your journey  but will you scorn our help  for we offer it to you ’
‘to me ’ said saruman  ‘nay  pray do not smile at me  i prefer your
frowns  and as for the lady here  i do not trust her  she always hated me  and
schemed for your part  i do not doubt that she has brought you this way to have
the pleasure of gloating over my poverty  had i been warned of your pursuit  i
would have denied you the pleasure ’
‘saruman ’ said galadriel  ‘we have other errands and other cares that
seem to us more urgent than hunting for you  say rather that you are overtaken
by good fortune  for now you have a last chance ’
‘if it be truly the last  i am glad ’ said saruman  ‘for i shall be
spared the trouble of refusing it again  all my hopes are ruined  but i would
not share yours  if you have any ’
for a moment his eyes kindled  ‘go ’ he said  ‘i did not spend long
study on these matters for naught  you have doomed yourselves  and you know it 
and it will afford me some comfort as i wander to think that you pulled down
your own house when you destroyed mine  and now  what ship will bear you back
across so wide a sea ’ he mocked  ‘it will be a grey ship  and full of
ghosts ’ he laughed  but his voice was cracked and hideous 
‘get up  you idiot ’ he shouted to the other beggar  who had sat down on
the ground  and he struck him with his staff  ‘turn about  if these fine folk
are going our way  then we will take another  get on  or i’ll give you no
crust for your supper ’
the beggar turned and slouched past whimpering  ‘poor old gríma 
poor old gríma  always beaten and cursed  how i hate him  i wish i
could leave him ’
‘then leave him ’ said gandalf 
but wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at
gandalf  and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman  as the wretched pair
passed by the company they came to the hobbits  and saruman stopped and stared
at them  but they looked at him with pity 
‘so you have come to gloat too  have you  my urchins ’ he said  ‘you
don’t care what a beggar lacks  do you  for you have all you want  food and
fine clothes  and the best weed for your pipes  oh yes  i know  i know where it
comes from  you would not give a pipeful to a beggar  would you ’
‘i would  if i had any ’ said frodo 
‘you can have what i have got left ’ said merry  ‘if you will wait a
moment ’ he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle  then he handed to
saruman a leather pouch  ‘take what there is ’ he said  ‘you are welcome
to it  it came from the flotsam of isengard ’
‘mine  mine  yes and dearly bought ’ cried saruman  clutching at the
pouch  ‘this is only a repayment in token  for you took more  i’ll be bound 
still  a beggar must be grateful  if a thief returns him even a morsel of his
own  well  it will serve you right when you come home  if you find things less
good in the southfarthing than you would like  long may your land be short of
leaf ’
‘thank you ’ said merry  ‘in that case i will have my pouch back  which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me  wrap the weed in a rag of your
own ’
‘one thief deserves another ’ said saruman  and turned his back on merry 
and kicked wormtongue  and went away towards the wood 
‘well  i like that ’ said pippin  ‘thief indeed  what of our claim for
waylaying  wounding  and orc-dragging us through rohan ’
‘ah ’ said sam  ‘and bought he said  how  i wonder  and i
didn’t like the sound of what he said about the southfarthing  it’s time we
got back ’
‘i’m sure it is ’ said frodo  ‘but we can’t go any quicker  if we
are to see bilbo  i am going to rivendell first  whatever happens ’
‘yes  i think you had better do that ’ said gandalf  ‘but alas for
saruman  i fear nothing more can be made of him  he has withered altogether  all
the same  i am not sure that treebeard is right  i fancy he could do some
mischief still in a small mean way ’
next day they went on into northern dunland  where no men now dwelt  though
it was a green and pleasant country  september came in with golden days and
silver nights  and they rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river  and
found the old ford  east of the falls where it went down suddenly into the
lowlands  far to the west in a haze lay the meres and eyots through which it
wound its way to the greyflood  there countless swans housed in a land of reeds 
so they passed into eregion  and at last a fair morning dawned  shimmering
above gleaming mists  and looking from their camp on a low hill the travellers
saw away in the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up into the sky
through floating clouds  caradhras  celebdil  and fanuidhol  they were near to
the gates of moria 
here now for seven days they tarried  for the time was at hand for another
parting which they were loth to make  soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk
would turn eastward  and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the dimrill stair
to the silverlode and to their own country  they had journeyed thus far by the
west-ways  for they had much to speak of with elrond and with gandalf  and here
they lingered still in converse with their friends  often long after the hobbits
were wrapped in sleep they would sit together under the stars  recalling the
ages that were gone and all their joys and labours in the world  or holding
council  concerning the days to come  if any wanderer had chanced to pass 
little would he have seen or heard  and it would have seemed to him only that he
saw grey figures  carved in stone  memorials of forgotten things now lost in
unpeopled lands  for they did not move or speak with mouth  looking from mind to
mind  and only their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to
and fro 
but at length all was said  and they parted again for a while  until it was
time for the three rings to pass away  quickly fading into the stones and the
shadows the grey-cloaked people of lórien rode towards the mountains 
and those who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and watched  until there
came out of the gathering mist a flash  and then they saw no more  frodo knew
that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell 
sam turned away and sighed  ‘i wish i was
going back to lórien ’
at last one evening they came over the high moors  suddenly as to travellers
it always seemed  to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and saw far below
the lamps shining in elrond’s house  and they went down and crossed the bridge
and came to the doors  and all the house was filled with light and song for joy
at elrond’s homecoming 
first of all  before they had eaten or washed or even shed their cloaks  the
hobbits went in search of bilbo  they found him all alone in his little room  it
was littered with papers and pens and pencils  but bilbo was sitting in a chair
before a small bright fire  he looked very old  but peaceful  and sleepy 
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in  ‘hullo  hullo ’ he
said  ‘so you’ve come back  and tomorrow’s my birthday  too  how clever of
you  do you know  i shall be one hundred and twenty-nine  and in one year more 
if i am spared  i shall equal the old took  i should like to beat him  but we
shall see ’
after the celebration of bilbo’s birthday the four hobbits stayed in
rivendell for some days  and they sat much with their old friend  who spent most
of his time now in his room  except at meals  for these he was still very
punctual as a rule  and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them  sitting
round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of their
journeys and adventures  at first he pretended to take some notes  but he often
fell asleep  and when he woke he would say  ‘how splendid  how wonderful  but
where were we ’ then they went on with the story from the point where he had
begun to nod 
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention was the
account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn  ‘i was invited to the wedding
of course ’ he said  ‘and i have waited for it long enough  but somehow 
when it came to it  i found i had so much to do here  and packing is such a
bother ’
when nearly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out of his window and saw
that there had been a frost in the night  and the cobwebs were like white nets 
then suddenly he knew that he must go  and say good-bye to bilbo  the weather
was still calm and fair  after one of the most lovely summers that people could
remember  but october had come  and it must break soon and begin to rain and
blow again  and there was still a very long way to go  yet it was not really the
thought of the weather that stirred him  he had a feeling that it was time he
went back to the shire  sam shared it  only the night before he had said 
‘well  mr  frodo  we’ve been far and seen a deal  and yet i don’t think
we’ve found a better place than this  there’s something of everything here 
if you understand me  the shire and the golden wood and gondor and kings’
houses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed  and yet  somehow  i feel we
ought to be going soon  i’m worried about my gaffer  to tell you the truth ’
‘yes  something of everything  sam  except the sea ’ frodo had answered 
and he repeated it now to himself  ‘except the sea ’
that day frodo spoke to elrond  and it was agreed that they should leave the
next morning  to their delight gandalf said  ‘i think i shall come too  at
least as far as bree  i want to see butterbur ’
in the evening they went to say good-bye to bilbo  ‘well  if you must go 
you must ’ he said  ‘i am sorry  i shall miss you  it is nice just to know
that you are about the place  but i am getting very sleepy ’ then he gave
frodo his mithril-coat and sting  forgetting that he had already done so  and he
gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times  written in
his spidery hand  and labelled on their red backs  translations from the
elvish  by b b 
to sam he gave a little bag of gold  ‘almost the last drop of the smaug
vintage ’ he said  ‘may come in useful  if you think of getting married 
sam ’ sam blushed 
‘i have nothing much to give to you young fellows ’ he said to merry and
pippin  ‘except good advice ’ and when he had given them a fair sample of
this  he added a last item in shire-fashion  ‘don’t let your heads get too
big for your hats  but if you don’t finish growing up soon  you are going to
find hats and clothes expensive ’
‘but if you want to beat the old took ’ said pippin  ‘i don’t see why
we shouldn’t try and beat the bullroarer ’
bilbo laughed  and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with pearl
mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver  ‘think of me when you smoke
them ’ he said  ‘the elves made them for me  but i don’t smoke now ’ and
then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little  and when he woke up
again he said  ‘now where were we  yes  of course  giving presents  which
reminds me  what’s become of my ring  frodo  that you took away ’
‘i have lost it  bilbo dear ’ said frodo  ‘i got rid of it  you
know ’
‘what a pity ’ said bilbo  ‘i should have liked to see it again  but
no  how silly of me  that’s what you went for  wasn’t it  to get rid of it 
but it is all so confusing  for such a lot of other things seem to have got
mixed up with it  aragorn’s affairs  and the white council and gondor  and the
horsemen  and southrons  and oliphaunts - did you really see one  sam  - and
caves and towers and golden trees  and goodness knows what besides 
‘i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip  i think
gandalf might have shown me round a bit  but then the auction would have been
over before i got back  and i should have had even more trouble than i did 
anyway it’s too late now  and really i think it’s much more comfortable to
sit here and hear about it all  the fire’s very cosy here  and the food’s
very good  and there are elves when you want them  what more could one want 
the road goes ever on and on

out from the door where it began 

now far ahead the road has gone 

let others follow it who can 

let them a journey new begin 

but i at last with weary feet

will turn towards the lighted inn 

my evening-rest and sleep to meet ’
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and he
slept soundly 
the evening deepened in the room  and the firelight burned brighter  and they
looked at bilbo as he slept and saw that his face was smiling  for some time
they sat in silence  and then sam looking round at the room and the shadows
flickering on the walls  said softly 
‘i don’t think  mr  frodo  that he’s done much writing while we’ve
been away  he won’t ever write our story now ’
at that bilbo opened an eye  almost as if he had heard  then he roused
himself  ‘you see  i am getting so sleepy ’ he said  ‘and when i have time
to write  i only really like writing poetry  i wonder  frodo my dear fellow  if
you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go  collect all my
notes and papers  and my diary too  and take them with you  if you will  you
see  i haven’t much time for the selection and the arrangement and all that 
get sam to help  and when you’ve knocked things into shape  come back  and
i’ll run over it  i won’t be too critical ’
‘of course i’ll do it ’ said frodo  ‘and of course i’ll come back
soon  it won’t be dangerous any more  there is a real king now and he will
soon put the roads in order ’
‘thank you  my dear fellow ’ said bilbo  ‘that really is a very great
relief to my mind ’ and with that he fell fast asleep again 
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took leave of bilbo in his room  for it
was cold out of doors  and then they said farewell to elrond and all his
household 
as frodo stood upon the threshold  elrond wished him a fair journey  and
blessed him  and he said 
‘i think  frodo  that maybe you will not need to come back  unless you come
very soon  for about this time of the year  when the leaves are gold before they
fall  look for bilbo in the woods of the shire  i shall be with him ’
these words no one else heard  and frodo kept them to himself 
 
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home  they were eager now
to see the shire again  but at first they rode only slowly  for frodo had been
ill at ease  when they came to the ford of bruinen  he had halted  and seemed
loth to ride into the stream  and they noted that for a while his eyes appeared
not to see them or things about him  all that day he was silent  it was the
sixth of october 
‘are you in pain  frodo ’ said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodo’s
side 
‘well  yes i am ’ said frodo  ‘it is my shoulder  the wound aches  and
the memory of darkness is heavy on me  it was a year ago today ’
‘alas  there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured ’ said gandalf 
‘i fear it may be so with mine ’ said frodo  ‘there is no real going
back  though i may come to the shire  it will not seem the same  for i shall not
be the same  i am wounded with knife  sting  and tooth  and a long burden  where
shall i find rest ’
gandalf did not answer 
by the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed  and frodo was
merry again  as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before 
after that the journey went well  and the days went quickly by  for they rode at
leisure  and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yellow in the autumn sun  at length they came to weathertop  and it was then
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road  then
frodo begged them to hasten  and he would not look towards the hill  but rode
through its shadow with head bowed and cloak drawn close about him  that night
the weather changed  and a wind came from the west laden with rain  and it blew
loud and chill  and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air  when they
came to the chetwood already the boughs were almost bare  and a great curtain of
rain veiled bree hill from their sight 
so it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last days of
october the five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the south-gate
of bree  it was locked fast  and the rain blew in their faces  and in the
darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by  and their hearts sank a little  for
they had expected more welcome 
when they had called many times  at last the gate-keeper came out  and they
saw that he carried a great cudgel  he looked at them with fear and suspicion 
but when he saw that gandalf was there  and that his companions were hobbits  in
spite of their strange gear  then he brightened and wished them welcome 
‘come in ’ he said  unlocking the gate  ‘we won’t stay for news out
here in the cold and the wet  a ruffianly evening  but old barley will no doubt
give you a welcome at the pony  and there you’ll hear all there is to
hear ’
‘and there you’ll hear later all that we say  and more ’ laughed
gandalf  ‘how is harry ’
the gate-keeper scowled  ‘gone ’ he said  ‘but you’d best ask
barliman  good evening ’
‘good evening to you ’ they said  and passed through  and then they
noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been built 
and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the fence  when
they came to bill ferny’s house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and
unkempt  and the windows were all boarded up 
‘do you think you killed him with that apple  sam ’ said pippin 
‘i’m not so hopeful  mr  pippin ’ said sam  ‘but i’d like to know
what became of that poor pony  he’s been on my mind many a time and the wolves
howling and all ’
at last they came to the prancing pony  and that at least looked
outwardly unchanged  and there were lights behind the red curtains in the lower
windows  they rang the bell  and nob came to the door  and opened it a crack and
peeped through  and when he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of
surprise 
‘mr  butterbur  master ’ he shouted  ‘they’ve come back ’
‘oh have they  i’ll learn them ’ came butterbur’s voice  and out he
came with a rush  and he had a club in his hand  but when he saw who they were
he stopped short  and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight 
‘nob  you woolly-pated ninny ’ he cried  ‘can’t you give old friends
their names  you shouldn’t go scaring me like that  with times as they are 
well  well  and where have you come from  i never expected to see any of you
folk again  and that’s a fact  going off into the wild with that strider  and
all those black men about  but i’m right glad to see you  and none more than
gandalf  come in  come in  the same rooms as - before  they’re free  indeed
most rooms are empty these days  as i’ll not hide from you  for you’ll find
it out soon enough  and i’ll see what can be done about supper  as soon as may
be  but i’m short-handed at present  hey  nob you slowcoach  tell bob  ah  but
there i’m forgetting  bob’s gone  goes home to his folk at nightfall now 
well  take the guests’ ponies to the stables  nob  and you’ll be taking your
horse to his stable yourself gandalf  i don’t doubt  a fine beast  as i said
when i first set eyes on him  well  come in  make yourselves at home ’
mr  butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking  and still
seemed to live in his old breathless bustle  and yet there was hardly anybody
about  and all was quiet  from the common room there came a low murmur of no
more than two or three voices  and seen closer in the light of two candles that
he lit and carried before them the landlord’s face looked rather wrinkled and
careworn 
he led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used on that
strange night more than a year ago  and they followed him  a little disquieted 
for it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting a brave face on some
trouble  things were not what they had been  but they said nothing  and waited 
as they expected mr  butterbur came to the parlour after supper to see if all
had been to their liking  as indeed it had  no change for the worse had yet come
upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate  ‘now i won’t
make so bold as to suggest you should come to the common room tonight ’ said
butterbur  ‘you’ll be tired  and there isn’t many folk there this evening 
anyway  but if you could spare me half an hour before you go to your beds  i
would dearly like to have some talk with you  quiet-like by ourselves ’
‘that is just what we should like  too ’ said gandalf  ‘we are not
tired  we have been taking things easy  we were wet  cold and hungry  but all
that you have cured  come  sit down  and if you have any pipe-weed  we’ll
bless you ’
‘well  if you’d called for anything else  i’d have been happier ’
said butterbur  ‘that’s just a thing that we’re short of  seeing how
we’ve only got what we grow ourselves  and that’s not enough  there’s none
to be had from the shire these days  but i’ll do what i can ’
when he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two  a wad
of uncut leaf  ‘southlinch ’ he said  ‘and the best we have  but not the
match of southfarthing  as i’ve always said though i’m all for bree in most
matters  begging your pardon ’
they put him in a large chair by the wood-fire  and gandalf sat on the other
side of the hearth  and the hobbits in low chairs between them  and then they
talked for many times half an hour  and exchanged all such news as mr  butterbur
wished to hear or give  most of the things which they had to tell were a mere
wonder and bewilderment to their host  and far beyond his vision  and they
brought forth few comments other than  ‘you don’t say  often repeated in
defiance of the evidence of mr  butterbur’s own ears  ‘you don’t say  mr 
baggins  or is it mr  underhill  i’m getting so mixed up  you don’t say 
master gandalf  well i never  who’d have thought it in our times ’
but he did say much on his own account  things were far from well  he would
say  business was not even fair  it was downright bad  ‘no one comes nigh bree
now from outside ’ he said  ‘and the inside folks  they stay at home mostly
and keep their doors barred  it all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that
began coming up the greenway last year  as you may remember  but more came
later  some were just poor bodies running away from trouble  but most were bad
men  full o’ thievery and mischief  and there was trouble right here in bree 
bad trouble  why  we had a real set-to  and there were some folk killed  killed
dead  if you’ll believe me ’
‘i will indeed ’ said gandalf  ‘how many ’
‘three and two ’ said butterbur  referring to the big folk and the
little  ‘there was poor mat heathertoes  and rowlie appledore  and little tom
pickthorn from over the hill  and willie banks from up-away  and one of the
underhills from staddle  all good fellows  and they’re missed  and harry
goatleaf that used to be on the west-gate  and that bill ferny  they came in on
the strangers’ side  and they’ve gone off with them  and it’s my belief
they let them in  on the night of the fight  i mean  and that was after we
showed them the gates and pushed them out  before the year’s end  that was 
and the fight was early in the new year  after the heavy snow we had 
‘and now they’re gone for robbers and live outside  hiding in the woods
beyond archet  and out in the wilds north-away  it’s like a bit of the bad old
times tales tell of  i say  it isn’t safe on the road and nobody goes far  and
folk lock up early  we have to keep watchers all round the fence and put a lot
of men on the gates at nights ’
‘well  no one troubled us ’ said pippin  ‘and we came along slowly  and
kept no watch  we thought we’d left all trouble behind us ’
‘ah  that you haven’t  master  more’s the pity ’ said butterbur 
‘but it’s no wonder they left you alone  they wouldn’t go for armed folk 
with swords and helmets and shields and all  make them think twice  that would 
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you ’
then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with
amazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their
gear  they themselves had become so used to warfare and to riding in
well-arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail
peeping from under their cloaks  and the helms of gondor and the mark  and the
fair devices on their shields  would seem outlandish in their own country  and
gandalf  too  was now riding on his tall grey horse  all clad in white with a
great mantle of blue and silver over all  and the long sword glamdring at his
side 
gandalf laughed  ‘well  well ’ he said  ‘if they are afraid of just
five of us  then we have met worse enemies on our travels  but at any rate they
will give you peace at night while we stay ’
‘how long will that be ’ said butterbur  ‘i’ll not deny we should be
glad to have you about for a bit  you see  we’re not used to such troubles 
and the rangers have all gone away  folk tell me  i don’t think we’ve
rightly understood till now what they did for us  for there’s been worse than
robbers about  wolves were howling round the fences last winter  and there’s
dark shapes in the woods  dreadful things that it makes the blood run cold to
think of  it’s been very disturbing  if you understand me ’
‘i expect it has ’ said gandalf  ‘nearly all lands have been disturbed
these days  very disturbed  but cheer up  barliman  you have been on the edge of
very great troubles  and i am only glad to hear that you have not been deeper
in  but better times are coming  maybe  better than any you remember  the
rangers have returned  we came back with them  and there is a king again 
barliman  he will soon be turning his mind this way 
‘then the greenway will be opened again  and his messengers will come
north  and there will be comings and goings  and the evil things will be driven
out of the waste-lands  indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer  and
there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness ’
mr  butterbur shook his head  ‘if there’s a few decent respectable folk
on the roads  that won’t do no harm ’ he said  ‘but we don’t want no
more rabble and ruffians  and we don’t want no outsiders at bree  nor near
bree at all  we want to be let alone  i don’t want a whole crowd o’
strangers camping here and settling there and tearing up the wild country ’
‘you will be let alone  barliman ’ said gandalf  ‘there is room enough
for realms between isen and greyflood  or along the shore lands south of the
brandywine  without any one living within many days’ ride of bree  and many
folk used to dwell away north  a hundred miles or more from here  at the far end
of the greenway  on the north downs or by lake evendim ’
‘up away by deadmen’s dike ’ said butterbur  looking even more dubious 
‘that’s haunted land  they say  none but a robber would go there ’
‘the rangers go there ’ said gandalf  ‘deadmen’s dike  you say  so it
has been called for long years  but its right name  barliman  is fornost erain 
norbury of the kings  and the king will come there again one day  and then
you’ll have some fair folk riding through ’
‘well  that sounds more hopeful  i’ll allow ’ said butterbur  ‘and it
will be good for business  no doubt  so long as he lets bree alone ’
‘he will ’ said gandalf  ‘he knows it and loves it ’
‘does he now ’ said butterbur looking puzzled  ‘though i’m sure i
don’t know why he should  sitting in his big chair up in his great castle 
hundreds of miles away  and drinking wine out of a golden cup  i shouldn’t
wonder  what’s the pony to him  or mugs o’ beer  not but what my
beer’s good  gandalf  it’s been uncommon good  since you came in the autumn
of last year and put a good word on it  and that’s been a comfort in trouble 
i will say ’
‘ah ’ said sam  ‘but he says your beer is always good ’
‘he says ’
‘of course he does  he’s strider  the chief of the rangers  haven’t you
got that into your head yet ’
it went in at last  and butterbur’s face was a study in wonder  the eyes in
his broad face grew round  and his mouth opened wide  and he gasped 
‘strider ’ he exclaimed when he got back his breath  ‘him with a crown and
all and a golden cup  well  what are we coming to ’
‘better times  for bree at any rate ’ said gandalf 
‘i hope so  i’m sure ’ said butterbur  ‘well  this has been the
nicest chat i’ve had in a month of mondays  and i’ll not deny that i’ll
sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart  you’ve given me a powerful lot
to think over  but i’ll put that off until tomorrow  i’m for bed  and i’ve
no doubt you’ll be glad of your beds too  hey  nob ’ he called  going to the
door  ‘nob  you slowcoach ’
‘now ’ he said to himself  slapping his forehead  ‘now what does that
remind me of ’
‘not another letter you’ve forgotten  i hope  mr  butterbur ’ said
merry 
‘now  now  mr  brandybuck  don’t go reminding me of that  but there 
you’ve broken my thought  now where was i  nob  stables  ah  that was it 
i’ve something that belongs to you  if you recollect bill ferny and the
horsethieving  his pony as you bought  well  it’s here  come back all of
itself  it did  but where it had been to you know better than me  it was as
shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail  but it was alive  nob’s
looked after it ’
‘what  my bill ’ cried sam  ‘well  i was born lucky  whatever my gaffer
may say  there’s another wish come true  where is he ’ sam would not go to
bed until he had visited bill in his stable 
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day  and mr  butterbur could not
complain of his business next evening at any rate  curiosity overcame all fears 
and his house was crowded  for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the
common room in the evening and answered a good many questions  bree memories
being retentive  frodo was asked many times if he had written his book 
‘not yet ’ he answered  ‘i am going home now to put my notes in
order ’ he promised to deal with the amazing events at bree  and so give a bit
of interest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and
less important affairs ‘away south’ 
then one of the younger folk called for a song  but at that a hush fell  and
he was frowned down  and the call was not repeated  evidently there was no wish
for any uncanny events in the common room again 
no trouble by day  nor any sound by night  disturbed the peace of bree while
the travellers remained there  but the next morning they got up early  for as
the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire before night  and it
was a long ride  the bree folk were all out to see them off  and were in merrier
mood than they had been for a year  and those who had not seen the strangers in
all their gear before gaped with wonder at them  at gandalf with his white
beard  and the light that seemed to gleam from him  as if his blue mantle was
only a cloud over sunshine  and at the four hobbits like riders upon errantry
out of almost forgotten tales  even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the king began to think there might be some truth in it 
‘well  good luck on your road  and good luck to your home-coming  said mr 
butterbur  ‘i should have warned you before that all’s not well in the shire
neither  if what we hear is true  funny goings on  they say  but one thing
drives out another  and i was full of my own troubles  but if i may be so bold 
you’ve come back changed from your travels  and you look now like folk as can
deal with troubles out of hand  i don’t doubt you’ll soon set all to rights 
good luck to you  and the oftener you come back the better i’ll be pleased ’
they wished him farewell and rode away  and passed through the west-gate and
on towards the shire  bill the pony was with them  and as before he had a good
deal of baggage  but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content 
‘i wonder what old barliman was hinting at ’ said frodo 
‘i can guess some of it ’ said sam gloomily  ‘what i saw in the mirror 
trees cut down and all  and my old gaffer turned out of the row  i ought to have
hurried back quicker ’
‘and something’s wrong with the southfarthing evidently ’ said merry 
‘there’s a general shortage of pipe-weed ’
‘whatever it is ’ said pippin  ‘lotho will be at the bottom of it  you
can be sure of that ’
‘deep in  but not at the bottom ’ said gandalf  ‘you have forgotten
saruman  he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did ’
‘well  we’ve got you with us ’ said merry  ‘so things will soon be
cleared up ’
‘i am with you at present ’ said gandalf  ‘but soon i shall not be  i
am not coming to the shire  you must settle its affairs yourselves  that is what
you have been trained for  do you not yet understand  my time is over  it is no
longer my task to set things to rights  nor to help folk to do so  and as for
you  my dear friends  you will need no help  you are grown up now  grown indeed
very high  among the great you are  and i have no longer any fear at all for any
of you 
‘but if you would know  i am turning aside soon  i am going to have a long
talk with bombadil  such a talk as i have not had in all my time  he is a
moss-gatherer  and i have been a stone doomed to rolling  but my rolling days
are ending  and now we shall have much to say to one another ’
in a little while they came to the point on the east road where they had
taken leave of bombadil  and they hoped and half expected to see him standing
there to greet them as they went by  but there was no sign of him  and there was
a grey mist on the barrow-downs southwards  and a deep veil over the old forest
far away 
they halted and frodo looked south wistfully  ‘i should dearly like to see
the old fellow again ’ he said  ‘i wonder how he is getting on ’
‘as well as ever  you may be sure ’ said gandalf  ‘quite untroubled and
i should guess  not much interested in anything that we have done or seen 
unless perhaps in our visits to the ents  there may be a time later for you to
go and see him  but if i were you  i should press on now for home  or you will
not come to the brandywine bridge before the gates are locked ’
‘but there aren’t any gates ’ said merry  ‘not on the road  you know
that quite well  there’s the buckland gate  of course  but they’ll let me
through that at any time ’
‘there weren’t any gates  you mean ’ said gandalf  ‘i think you will
find some now  and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than
you think  but you’ll  manage all right  good-bye dear friends  not for the
last time  not yet  good-bye ’
he turned shadowfax off the road  and the great horse leaped the green dike
that here ran beside it  and then at a cry from gandalf he was gone  racing
towards the barrow-downs like a wind from the north 
‘well here we are  just the four of us that started out together ’ said
merry  ‘we have left all the rest behind  one after another  it seems almost
like a dream that has slowly faded ’
‘not to me ’ said frodo  ‘to me it feels more like falling asleep
again ’
 
it was after nightfall when  wet and tired  the travellers came at last to
the brandywine  and they found the way barred  at either end of the bridge there
was a great spiked gate  and on the further side of the river they could see
that some new houses had been built  two-storeyed with narrow straight-sided
windows  bare and dimly lit  all very gloomy and un-shirelike 
they hammered on the outer gate and called  but there was at first no answer 
and then to their surprise someone blew a horn  and the lights in the windows
went out  a voice shouted in the dark 
‘who’s that  be off  you can’t come in  can’t you read the notice  no
admittance between sundown and sunrise ’
‘of course we can’t read the notice in the dark ’ sam shouted back 
‘and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like
this  i’ll tear down your notice when i find it ’
at that a window slammed  and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of
the house on the left  they opened the further gate  and some came over the
bridge  when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened 
‘come along ’ said merry  recognizing one of the hobbits  ‘if you
don’t know me  hob hayward  you ought to  i am merry brandybuck  and i should
like to know what all this is about  and what a bucklander like you is doing
here  you used to be on the hay gate ’
‘bless me  it’s master merry  to be sure  and all dressed up for
fighting ’ said old hob  ‘why  they said you was dead  lost in the old
forest by all accounts  i’m pleased to see you alive after all ’
‘then stop gaping at me through the bars  and open the gate ’ said merry 
‘i’m sorry  master merry  but we have orders ’
‘whose orders ’
‘the chief’s up at bag end ’
‘chief  chief  do you mean mr  lotho ’ said frodo 
‘i suppose so  mr  baggins  but we have to say just “the chief”
nowadays ’
‘do you indeed ’ said frodo  ‘well  i am glad he has dropped the
baggins at any rate  but it is evidently high time that the family dealt with
him and put him in his place ’
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate  ‘it won’t do no good talking
that way ’ said one  ‘he’ll get to hear of it  and if you make so much
noise  you’ll wake the chief’s big man ’
‘we shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him ’ said merry  ‘if
you mean that your precious chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild  then
we’ve not come back too soon ’ he sprang from his pony  and seeing the
notice in the light of the lanterns  he tore it down and threw it over the gate 
the hobbits backed away and made no move to open it  ‘come on  pippin ’ said
merry  ‘two is enough ’
merry and pippin climbed the gate  and the hobbits fled  another horn
sounded  out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared
against a light in the doorway 
‘what’s all this ’ he snarled as he came forward  ‘gate-breaking  you
clear out  or i’ll break your filthy little necks ’ then he stopped  for he
had caught the gleam of swords 
‘bill ferny ’ said merry  ‘if you don’t open that gate in ten
seconds  you’ll regret it  i shall set steel to you  if you don’t obey  and
when you have opened the gates you will go through them and never return  you
are a ruffian and a highway-robber ’
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it  ‘give me the
key ’ said merry  but the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted out
into the darkness  as he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his heels
and just caught him as he ran  he went off with a yelp into the night and was
never heard of again 
‘neat work  bill ’ said sam  meaning the pony 
‘so much for your big man ’ said merry  ‘we’ll see the chief later 
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night  and as you seem to have pulled
down the bridge inn and built this dismal place instead  you’ll have to put us
up ’
‘i am sorry  mr  merry ’ said hob  ‘but it isn’t allowed ’
‘what isn’t allowed ’
taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food  and all that  said hob 
‘what’s the matter with the place ’ said merry  ‘has it been a bad
year  or what  i thought it had been a fine summer and harvest ’
‘well no  the year’s been good enough ’ said hob  ‘we grows a lot of
food  but we don’t rightly know what becomes of it  it’s all these
“gatherers” and “sharers”  i reckon  going round counting and measuring
and taking off to storage  they do more gathering than sharing  and we never see
most of the stuff again ’
‘oh come ’ said pippin yawning  ‘this is all too tiresome for me
tonight  we’ve got food in our bags  just give us a room to lie down in 
it’ll be better than many places i have seen ’
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease  evidently some rule or
other was being broken  but there was no gainsaying four such masterful
travellers  all armed  and two of them uncommonly large and strong-looking 
frodo ordered the gates to be locked again  there was some sense at any rate in
keeping a guard  while ruffians were still about  then the four companions went
into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as comfortable as they could  it
was a bare and ugly place  with a mean little grate that would not allow a good
fire  in the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds  and on every wall there
was a notice and a list of rules  pippin tore them down  there was no beer and
very little food  but with what the travellers brought and shared out they all
made a fair meal  and pippin broke rule 4 by putting most of next day’s
allowance of wood on the fire 
‘well now  what about a smoke  while you tell us what has been happening in
the shire ’ he said 
‘there isn’t no pipe-weed now ’ said hob  ‘at least only for the
chief’s men  all the stocks seem to have gone  we do hear that waggon-loads of
it went away down the old road out of the southfarthing  over sarn ford way 
that would be the end o’ last year  after you left  but it had been going away
quietly before that  in a small way  that lotho-‘
‘now you shut up  hob hayward ’ cried several of the others  ‘you know
talk o’ that sort isn’t allowed  the chief will hear of it  and we’ll all
be in trouble ’
‘he wouldn’t hear naught  if some of you here weren’t sneaks ’
rejoined hob hotly 
‘all right  all right ’ said sam  “that’s quite enough  i don’t
want to hear no more  no welcome  no beer  no smoke  and a lot of rules and
orc-talk instead  i hoped to have a rest  but i can see there’s work and
trouble ahead  let’s sleep and forget it till morning ’
the new ‘chief’ evidently had means of getting news  it was a good forty
miles from the bridge to bag end  but someone made the journey in a hurry  so
frodo and his friends soon discovered 
they had not made any definite plans  but had vaguely thought of going down
to crickhollow together first  and resting there a bit  but now  seeing what
things were like  they decided to go straight to hobbiton  so the next day they
set out along the road and jogged along steadily  the wind had dropped but the
sky was grey  the land looked rather sad and forlorn  but it was after all the
first of november and the fag-end of autumn  still there seemed an unusual
amount of burning going on  and smoke rose from many points round about  a great
cloud of it was going up far away in the direction of the woody end 
as evening fell they were drawing near to frogmorton  a village right on the
road  about twenty-two miles from the bridge  there they meant to stay the
night  the floating log at frogmorton was a good inn  but as they came to
the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board saying no
road  and behind it stood a large band of shirriffs with staves in their hands
and feathers in their caps  looking both important and rather scared 
‘what’s all this ’ said frodo  feeling inclined to laugh 
this is what it is  mr  baggins  said the leader of the shirriffs  a
two-feather hobbit  ‘you’re arrested for gate-breaking  and tearing up of
rules  and assaulting gate-keepers  and trespassing  and sleeping in
shire-buildings without leave  and bribing guards with food ’
‘and what else ’ said frodo 
‘that’ll do to go on with ’ said the shirriff-leader 
‘i can add some more  if you like it ’ said sam  ‘calling your chief
names  wishing to punch his pimply face  and thinking you shirriffs look a lot
of tom-fools ’
‘there now  mister  that’ll do  it’s the chief’s orders that you’re
to come along quiet  we’re going to take you to bywater and hand you over to
the chief’s men  and when he deals with your case you can have your say  but
if you don’t want to stay in the lockholes any longer than you need  i should
cut the say short  if i was you ’
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his companions all roared with
laughter  ‘don’t be absurd ’ said frodo  ‘i am going where i please  and
in my own time  i happen to be going to bag end on business  but if you insist
on going too  well that is your affair ’
‘very well  mr  baggins ’ said the leader  pushing the barrier aside 
‘but don’t forget i’ve arrested you ’
‘i won’t ’ said frodo  ‘never  but i may forgive you  now i am not
going any further today  so if you’ll kindly escort me to the floating log 
i’ll be obliged ’
‘i can’t do that  mr  baggins  the inn’s closed  there’s a
shirriff-house at the far end of the village  i’ll take you there  ‘
‘all right ’ said frodo  ‘go on and we’ll follow ’
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that he
knew  ‘hey  come here robin smallburrow ’ he called  ‘i want a word with
you ’
with a sheepish glance at his leader  who looked wrathful but did not dare to
interfere  shirriff smallburrow fell back and walked beside sam  who got down
off his pony 
‘look here  cock-robin ’ said sam  ‘you’re hobbiton-bred and ought to
have more sense  coming a-waylaying mr  frodo and all  and what’s all this
about the inn being closed ’
‘they’re all closed ’ said robin  ‘the chief doesn’t hold with
beer  leastways that is how it started  but now i reckon it’s his men that has
it all  and he doesn’t hold with folk moving about  so if they will or they
must  then they has to go to the shirriff-house and explain their business ’
‘you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such
nonsense ’ said sam  ‘you used to like the inside of an inn better than the
outside yourself  you were always popping in  on duty or off ’
‘and so i would be still  sam  if i could  but don’t be hard on me  what
can i do  you know how i went for a shirriff seven years ago  before any of this
began  gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing folk  and
hearing the news  and knowing where the good beer was  but now it’s
different ’
‘but you can give it up  stop shirriffing  if it has stopped being a
respectable job ’ said sam 
‘we’re not allowed to ’ said robin 
‘if i hear not allowed much oftener ’ said sam  ‘i’m going to
get angry ’
‘can’t say as i’d be sorry to see it ’ said robin lowering his voice 
‘if we all got angry together something might be done  but it’s these men 
sam  the chief’s men  he sends them round everywhere  and if any of us small
folk stand up for our rights  they drag him off to the lockholes  they took old
flourdumpling  old will whitfoot the mayor  first  and they’ve taken a lot
more  lately it’s been getting worse  often they beat ‘em now ’
‘then why do you do their work far them ’ said sam angrily  ‘who sent
you to frogmorton ’
‘no one did  we stay here in the big shirriff-house  we’re the first
eastfarthing troop now  there’s hundreds of shirriffs all told and they want
more  with all these new rules  most of them are in it against their will  but
not all  even in the shire there are some as like minding other folk’s
business and talking big  and there’s worse than that  there’s a few as do
spy-work for the chief and his men ’
‘ah  so that’s how you had news of us  is it ’
‘that’s right  we aren’t allowed to send by it now  but they use the
old quick post service  and keep special runners at different points  one came
in from whitfurrows last night with a “secret message”  and another took it
on from here  and a message came back this afternoon saying you was to be
arrested and taken to bywater  not direct to the lockholes  the chief wants to
see you at once  evidently ’
‘he won’t be so eager when mr  frodo has finished with him ’ said sam 
the shirriff-house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge-house  it had only
one storey  but it had the same narrow windows  and it was built of ugly pale
bricks  badly laid  inside it was damp and cheerless  and supper was served on a
long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks  the food deserved no
better setting  the travellers were glad to leave the place  it was about
eighteen miles to bywater  and they set off at ten o’clock in the morning 
they would have started earlier  only the delay so plainly annoyed the
shirriff-leader  the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder 
but the rain was gone 
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village  though the few folk
that came out to stare at the ‘get-up’ of the travellers did not seem quite
sure whether laughing was allowed  a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort
to the ‘prisoners’  but merry made them march in front  while frodo and his
friends rode behind  merry  pippin  and sam sat at their ease laughing and
talking and singing  while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and
important  frodo  however  was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful 
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge 
‘hullo  hullo ’ he jeered  ‘now who’s arrested who ’
two of the shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him 
‘leader ’ said merry  ‘order your fellows back to their places at once  if
you don’t want me to deal with them ’
the two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily  ‘now get
on ’ said merry  and after that the travellers saw to it that their ponies’
pace was quick enough to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go  the
sun came out  and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon puffing and
sweating 
at the three-farthing stone they gave it up  they had done nearly fourteen
miles with only one rest at noon  it was now three o’clock  they were hungry
and very footsore and they could not stand the pace 
‘well  come along in your own time ’ said merry  ‘we are going on ’
‘good-bye  cock-robin ’ said sam  ‘i’ll wait for you outside the
green dragon  if you haven’t forgotten where that is  don’t dawdle on
the way ’
‘you’re breaking arrest  that’s what you’re doing ’ said the leader
ruefully  ‘and i can’t be answerable ’
‘we shall break a good many things yet  and not ask you to answer ‘ said
pippin  ‘good luck to you ’
the travellers trotted on  and as the sun began to sink towards the white
downs far away on the western horizon they came to bywater by its wide pool  and
there they had their first really painful shock  this was frodo and sam’s own
country  and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other
place in the world  many of the houses that they had known were missing  some
seemed to have been burned down  the pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the
bank on the north side of the pool were deserted  and their little gardens that
used to run down bright to the water’s edge were rank with weeds  worse  there
was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along pool side  where the hobbiton
road ran close to the bank  an avenue of trees had stood there  they were all
gone  and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end they saw a tall
chimney of brick in the distance  it was pouring out black smoke into the
evening air 
sam was beside himself  ‘i’m going right on  mr  frodo ’ he cried 
‘i’m going to see what’s up  i want to find my gaffer ’
‘we ought to find out first what we’re in for  sam ’ said merry  ‘i
guess that the “chief” will have a gang of ruffians handy  we had better
find someone who will tell us how things are round here ’
but in the village of bywater all the houses and holes were shut  and no one
greeted them  they wondered at this  but they soon discovered the reason of it 
when they reached the green dragon  the last house on the hobbiton side 
now lifeless and with broken windows  they were disturbed to see half a dozen
large ill-favoured men lounging against the inn-wall  they were squint-eyed and
sallow-faced 
‘like that friend of bill ferny’s at bree ’ said sam 
‘like many that i saw at isengard ’ muttered merry 
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts  but they had
no other weapons  as far as could be seen  as the travellers rode up they left
the wall and walked into the road  blocking the way 
‘where d’you think you’re going ’ said one  the largest and most
evil-looking of the crew  ‘there’s no road for you any further  and where
are those precious shirriffs ’
‘coming along nicely ’ said merry  ‘a little footsore  perhaps  we
promised to wait for them here ’
‘garn  what did i say ’ said the ruffian to his mates  ‘i told sharkey
it was no good trusting those little fools  some of our chaps ought to have been
sent ’
‘and what difference would that have made  pray ’ said merry  ‘we are
not used to footpads in this country  but we know how to deal with them ’
‘footpads  eh ’ said the man  ‘so that’s your tone  is it  change it 
or we’ll change it for you  you little folk are getting too uppish  don’t
you trust too much in the boss’s kind heart  sharkey’s come now and he’ll
do what sharkey says ’
‘and what may that be ’ said frodo quietly 
‘this country wants waking up and setting to rights ’ said the ruffian 
‘and sharkey’s going to do it  and make it hard  if you drive him to it  you
need a bigger boss  and you’ll get one before the year is out  if there’s
any more trouble  then you’ll learn a thing or two  you little rat-folk ’
‘indeed  i am glad to hear of your plans ’ said frodo  ‘i am on my way
to call on mr  lotho  and he may be interested to hear of them too ’
the ruffian laughed  ‘lotho  he knows all right  don’t you worry  he’ll
do what sharkey says  because if a boss gives trouble  we can change him  see 
and if little folks try to push in where they’re not wanted  we can put them
out of mischief  see ’
‘yes  i see ’ said frodo  ‘for one thing  i see that you’re behind
the times and the news here  much has happened since you left the south  your
day is over  and all other ruffians’  the dark tower has fallen  and there is
a king in gondor  and isengard has been destroyed  and your precious master is a
beggar in the wilderness  i passed him on the road  the king’s messengers will
ride up the greenway now not bullies from isengard ’
the man stared at him and smiled  ‘a beggar in the wilderness ’ he
mocked  ‘oh  is he indeed  swagger it  swagger it  my little cock-a-whoop  but
that won’t stop us living in this fat little country where you have lazed long
enough  and’ - he snapped his fingers in frodo’s face - ‘king’s
messengers  that for them  when i see one  i’ll take notice  perhaps ’
this was too much for pippin  his thoughts went back to the field of
cormallen  and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the ring-bearer ‘little
cock-a-whoop’  he cast back his cloak  flashed out his sword  and the silver
and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward 
‘i am a messenger of the king ’ he said  ‘you are speaking to the
king’s friend  and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the west  you
are a ruffian and a fool  down on your knees in the road and ask pardon  or i
will set this troll’s bane in you ’
the sword glinted in the westering sun  merry and sam drew their swords also
and rode up to support pippin  but frodo did not move  the ruffians gave back 
scaring breeland peasants  and bullying bewildered hobbits  had been their work 
fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise  and
there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard
before  it chilled them with fear 
‘go ’ said merry  ‘if you trouble this village again  you will regret
it ’ the three hobbits came on  and then the ruffians turned and fled running
away up the hobbiton road  but they blew their horns as they ran 
‘well  we’ve come back none too soon ’ said merry 
‘not a day too soon  perhaps too late  at any rate to save lotho ’ said
frodo  ‘miserable fool  but i am sorry for him ’
‘save lotho  whatever do you mean ’ said pippin  ‘destroy him i should
say ’
‘i don’t think you quite understand things  pippin ’ said frodo 
‘lotho never meant things to come to this pass  he has been a wicked fool  but
he’s caught now  the ruffians are on top  gathering  robbing and bullying  and
running or ruining things as they like  in his name  and not in his name even
for much longer  he’s a prisoner in bag end now  i expect  and very
frightened  we ought to try and rescue him ’
‘well i am staggered ’ said pippin  ‘of all the ends to our journey
that is the very last i should have thought of  to have to fight half-orcs and
ruffians in the shire itself - to rescue lotho pimple ’
‘fight ’ said frodo  ‘well  i suppose it may come to that  but
remember  there is to be no slaying of hobbits  not even if they have gone over
to the other side  really gone over  i mean  not just obeying ruffians’ orders
because they are frightened  no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the
shire  and it is not to begin now  and nobody is to be killed at all  if it can
be helped  keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment ’
‘but if there are many of these ruffians ’ said merry  ‘it will
certainly mean fighting  you won’t rescue lotho  or the shire  just by being
shocked and sad  my dear frodo ’
‘no ’ said pippin  ‘it won’t be so easy scaring them a second time 
they were taken by surprise  you heard that horn-blowing  evidently there are
other ruffians near at hand  they’ll be much bolder when there’s more of
them together  we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night  after
all we’re only four  even if we are armed ’
‘i’ve an idea ’ said sam  ‘let’s go to old tom cotton’s down
south lane  he always was a stout fellow  and he has a lot of lads that were all
friends of mine ’
‘no ’ said merry  ‘it’s no good “getting under cover”  that is
just what people have been doing  and just what these ruffians like  they will
simply come down on us in force  corner us  and then drive us out  or burn us
in  no  we have got to do something at once ’
‘do what ’ said pippin 
‘raise the shire ’ said merry  ‘now  wake all our people  they hate all
this  you can see  all of them except perhaps one or two rascals  and a few
fools that want to be important  but don’t at all understand what is really
going on  but shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don’t know what
to do  they just want a match  though  and they’ll go up in fire  the
chief’s men must know that  they’ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick 
we’ve only got a very short time 
‘sam  you can make a dash for cotton’s farm  if you like  he’s the
chief person round here  and the sturdiest  come on  i am going to blow the horn
of rohan  and give them all some music they have never heard before ’
they rode back to the middle of the village  there sam turned aside and
galloped off down the lane that led south to cotton’s  he had not gone far
when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky  far over hill
and field it echoed  and so compelling was that call that sam himself almost
turned and dashed back  his pony reared and neighed 
‘on  lad  on ’ he cried  ‘we’ll be going back soon ’
then he heard merry change the note  and up went the horn-cry of buckland 
shaking the air 
awake  awake  fear  fire  foes  awake 

fire  foes  awake 
behind him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of
doors  in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming  dogs barked  feet came
running  before he got to the lane’s end there was farmer cotton with three of
his lads  young tom  jolly  and nick  hurrying towards him  they had axes in
their hands  and barred the way 
‘nay  it’s not one of them ruffians ’ sam heard the farmer say 
‘it’s a hobbit by the size of it  but all dressed up queer  hey ’ he
cried  ‘who are you  and what’s all this to-do ’
‘it’s sam  sam gamgee  i’ve come back ’
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight  ‘well ’ he
exclaimed  ‘the voice is right  and your face is no worse than it was  sam 
but i should a’ passed you in the street in that gear  you’ve been in
foreign parts  seemingly  we feared you were dead ’
‘that i ain’t ’ said sam  ‘nor mr  frodo  he’s here and his
friends  and that’s the to-do  they’re raising the shire  we’re going to
clear out these ruffians  and their chief too  we’re starting now ’
‘good  good ’ cried farmer cotton  ‘so it’s begun at last  i’ve
been itching for trouble all this year  but folks wouldn’t help  and i’ve
had the wife and rosie to think of  these ruffians don’t stick at nothing  but
come on now  lads  bywater is up  we must be in it ’
‘what about mrs  cotton and rosie ’ said sam  ‘it isn’t safe yet for
them to be left all alone ’
‘my nibs is with them  but you can go and help him  if you have a mind ’
said farmer cotton with a grin  then he and his sons ran off towards the
village 
sam hurried to the house  by the large round door at the top of the steps
from the wide yard stood mrs  cotton and rosie  and nibs in front of them
grasping a hay-fork 
‘it’s me ’ shouted sam as he trotted up  ‘sam gamgee  so don’t try
prodding me  nibs  anyway  i’ve a mail-shirt on me ’
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps  they stared at him in
silence  ‘good evening  mrs  cotton ’ he said  ‘hullo rosie ’
‘hullo  sam ’ said rosie  ‘where’ve you been i they said you were
dead  but i’ve been expecting you since the spring  you haven’t hurried have
you ’
‘perhaps not ’ said sam abashed  ‘but i’m hurrying now  we’re
setting about the ruffians  and i’ve got to get back to mr  frodo  but i
thought i’d have a look and see how mrs  cotton was keeping  and you 
rosie ’
‘we’re keeping nicely  thank you ’ said mrs  cotton  ‘or should be 
if it weren’t for these thieving ruffians ’
‘well  be off with you ’ said rosie  ‘if you’ve been looking after
mr  frodo all this while  what d’you want to leave him for  as soon as things
look dangerous ’
this was too much for sam  it needed a week’s answer  or none  he turned
away and mounted his pony  but as he started off  rosie ran down the steps 
‘i think you look fine  sam ’ she said  ‘go on now  but take care of
yourself  and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians ’
when sam got back he found the whole village roused  already  apart from many
younger lads  more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes  and
heavy hammers  and long knives  and stout staves  and a few had hunting-bows 
more were still coming in from outlying farms 
some of the village-folk had lit a large fire  just to enliven things  and
also because it was one of the things forbidden by the chief  it burned bright
as night came on  others at merry’s orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village  when the shirriffs came up to the lower one
they were dumbfounded  but as soon as they saw how things were  most of them
took off their feathers and joined in the revolt  the others slunk away 
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old tom cotton  while
an admiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared 
‘well  what’s the next move ’ said farmer cotton 
‘i can’t say ’ said frodo  ‘until i know more  how many of these
ruffians are there ’
‘that’s hard to tell ’ said cotton  ‘they moves about and comes and
goes  there’s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton way  but they
go out from there roving round  thieving or “gathering” as they call it 
still there’s seldom less than a score round the boss  as they names him 
he’s at bag end  or was  but he don’t go outside the rounds now  no one s
seen him at all  in fact  for a week or two  but the men don’t let no one go
near ’
‘hobbiton’s not their only place  is it ’ said pippin 
‘no  more’s the pity ’ said cotton  ‘there’s a good few down south
in longbottom and by sarn ford  i hear  and some more lurking in the woody end 
and they’ve sheds at waymeet  and then there’s the lockholes  as they call
‘em  the old storage-tunnels at michel delving that they’ve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them  still i reckon there’s not above three
hundred of them in the shire all told  and maybe less  we can master them  if we
stick together ’
‘have they got any weapons ’ asked merry 
‘whips  knives  and clubs  enough for their dirty work  that’s all
they’ve showed so far ’ said cotton  ‘but i dare say they’ve got other
gear  if it comes to fighting  some have bows  anyway  they’ve shot one or two
of our folk ’
‘there you are  frodo ’ said merry  ‘i knew we should have to fight 
well  they started the killing ’
‘not exactly ’ said cotton  ‘leastways not the shooting  tooks started
that  you see our dad mr  peregrin  he’s never had no truck with this lotho 
not from the beginning  said that if anyone was going to play the chief at this
time of day  it would be the right thain of the shire and no upstart  and when
lotho sent his men they got no change out of him  tooks are lucky  they’ve got
those deep holes in the green hills  the great smials and all  and the ruffians
can’t come at ‘em  and they won’t let the ruffians come on their land  if
they do  tooks hunt ‘em  tooks shot three for prowling and robbing  after that
the ruffians turned nastier  and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland  no
one gets in nor out of it now ’
‘good for the tooks ’ cried pippin  ‘but someone is going to get in
again  now  i am off to the smials  anyone coming with me to tuckborough ’
pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies  ‘see you soon ’ he
cried  ‘it’s only fourteen miles or so over the fields  i’ll bring you
back an army of tooks in the morning ’ merry blew a horn-call after them as
they rode off into the gathering night  the people cheered 
‘all the same ’ said frodo to all those who stood near  ‘i wish for no
killing  not even of the ruffians  unless it must be done  to prevent them from
hurting hobbits ’
‘all right ’ said merry  ‘but we shall be having a visit from the
hobbiton gang any time now  i think  they won’t come just to talk things over 
we’ll try to deal with them neatly  but we must be prepared for the worst  now
i’ve got a plan ’
‘very good ’ said frodo  ‘you make the arrangements ’
just then some hobbits  who had been sent out towards hobbiton  came running
in  ‘they’re coming ’ they said  ‘a score or more  but two have gone off
west across country ’
‘to waymeet  that’ll be ’ said cotton  ‘to fetch more of the gang 
well  it’s fifteen mile each way  we needn’t trouble about them just yet ’
merry hurried off to give orders  farmer cotton cleared the street  sending
everyone indoors  except the older hobbits who had weapons of some sort  they
had not long to wait  soon they could hear loud voices  and then the tramping of
heavy feet  presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road  they saw
the barrier and laughed  they did not imagine that there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twenty of their kind together 
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside  ‘thank you ’ the men
jeered  ‘now run home to bed before you’re whipped ’ then they marched
along the street shouting  ‘put those lights out  get indoors and stay there 
or we’ll take fifty of you to the lockholes for a year  get in  the boss is
losing his temper ’
no one paid any heed to their orders  but as the ruffians passed  they closed
in quietly behind and followed them  when the men reached the fire there was
farmer cotton standing all alone warming his hands 
‘who are you  and what d’you think you’re doing ’ said the
ruffian-leader 
farmer cotton looked at him slowly  ‘i was just going to ask you that ’
he said  ‘this isn’t your country  and you’re not wanted ’
‘well  you’re wanted anyhow ’ said the leader  ‘we want you  take him
lads  lockholes for him  and give him something to keep him quiet ’
the men took one step forward and stopped short  there rose a roar of voices
all round them  and suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all
alone  they were surrounded  in the dark on the edge of the firelight stood a
ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows  there was nearly two
hundred of them  all holding some weapon 
merry stepped forward  ‘we have met before ’ he said to the leader 
‘and i warned you not to come back here  i warn you again  you are standing in
the light and you are covered by archers  if you lay a finger on this farmer  or
on anyone else  you will be shot at once  lay down any weapons that you have ’
the leader looked round  he was trapped  but he was not scared  not now with
a score of his fellows to back him  he knew too little of hobbits to understand
his peril  foolishly he decided to fight  it would be easy to break out 
‘at ‘em lads ’ he cried  ‘let ‘em have it ’
with a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a rush at
the ring  trying to burst out back towards hobbiton  he aimed a savage blow at
merry who stood in his way  he fell dead with four arrows in him 
that was enough for the others  they gave in  their weapons were taken from
them  and they were roped together  and marched off to an empty hut that they
had built themselves  and there they were tied hand and foot  and locked up
under guard  the dead leader was dragged off and buried 
‘seems almost too easy after all  don’t it ’ said cotton  ‘i said we
could master them  but we needed a call  you came back in the nick o’ time 
mr  merry ’
‘there’s more to be done still ’ said merry  ‘if you’re right in
your reckoning  we haven’t dealt with a tithe of them yet  but it’s dark
now  i think the next stroke must wait until morning  then we must call on the
chief ’
‘why not now ’ said sam  ‘it’s not much more than six o’clock  and
i want to see my gaffer  d’you know what’s come of him  mr  cotton ’
‘he’s not too well  and not too bad  sam ’ said the farmer  ‘they dug
up bagshot row  and that was a sad blow to him  he’s in one of them new houses
that the chief’s men used to build while they still did any work other than
burning and thieving  not above a mile from the end of bywater  but he comes
around to me  when he gets a chance  and i see he’s better fed than some of
the poor bodies  all against the rules  of course  i’d have had him
with me  but that wasn’t allowed ’
‘thank’ee indeed  mr  cotton  and i’ll never forget it ’ said sam 
‘but i want to see him  that boss and that sharkey  as they spoke of  they
might do a mischief up there before the morning ’
‘all right  sam ’ said cotton  ‘choose a lad or two  and go and fetch
him to my house  you’ll not have need to go near the old hobbiton village over
water  my jolly here will show you ’
sam went off  merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards at
the barriers during the night  then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton 
they sat with the family in the warm kitchen  and the cottons asked a few polite
questions about their travels  but hardly listened to the answers  they were far
more concerned with events in the shire 
‘it all began with pimple  as we call him ’ said farmer cotton  ‘and it
began as soon as you’d gone off  mr  frodo  he’d funny ideas had pimple 
seems he wanted to own everything himself  and then order other folk about  it
soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him  and he
was always grabbing more  though where he got the money was a mystery  mills and
malt-houses and inns  and farms  and leaf-plantations  he’d already bought
sandyman’s mill before he came to bag end  seemingly 
‘of course he started with a lot of property in the southfarthing which he
had from his dad  and it seems he’d been selling a lot o’ the best leaf  and
sending it away quietly for a year or two  but at the end o’ last year he
began sending away loads of stuff  not only leaf  things began to get short  and
winter coming on  too  folk got angry  but he had his answer  a lot of men 
ruffians mostly  came with great waggons  some to carry off the goods
south-away  and others to stay  and more came  and before we knew where we were
they were planted here and there all over the shire  and were felling trees and
digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked  at first
goods and damage was paid for by pimple  but soon they began lording it around
and taking what they wanted 
‘then there was a bit of trouble  but not enough  old will the mayor set
off for bag end to protest  but he never got there  ruffians laid hands on him
and took and locked him up in a hole in michel delving  and there he is now  and
after that  it would be soon after new year  there wasn’t no more mayor  and
pimple called himself chief shirriff  or just chief  and did as he liked  and if
anyone got “uppish” as they called it  they followed will  so things went
from bad to worse  there wasn’t no smoke left  save for the men  and the chief
didn’t hold with beer  save for his men  and closed all the inns  and
everything except rules got shorter and shorter  unless one could hide a bit of
one’s own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up “for fair
distribution”  which meant they got it and we didn’t  except for the
leavings which you could have at the shirriff-houses  if you could stomach them 
all very bad  but since sharkey came it’s been plain ruination ’
‘who is this sharkey ’ said merry  ‘i heard one of the ruffians speak
of him ’
‘the biggest ruffian o’ the lot  seemingly ’ answered cotton  ‘it was
about last harvest  end o’ september maybe  that we first heard of him 
we’ve never seen him  but he’s up at bag end  and he’s the real chief now 
i guess  all the ruffians do what he says  and what he says is mostly hack 
burn  and ruin  and now it s come to killing  there s no longer even any bad
sense in it  they cut down trees and let ‘em lie  they burn houses and build
no more 
‘take sandyman’s mill now  pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he
came to bag end  then he brought in a lot o’ dirty-looking men to build a
bigger one and fill it full o’ wheels and outlandish contraptions  only that
fool ted was pleased by that  and he works there cleaning wheels for the men 
where his dad was the miller and his own master  pimple’s idea was to grind
more and faster  or so he said  he’s got other mills like it  but you’ve got
to have grist before you can grind  and there was no more for the new mill to do
than for the old  but since sharkey came they don’t grind no more corn at all 
they’re always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a stench  and there
isn’t no peace even at night in hobbiton  and they pour out filth a purpose 
they’ve fouled all the lower water and it’s getting down into brandywine  if
they want to make the shire into a desert  they’re going the right way about
it  i don’t believe that fool of a pimple’s behind all this  it’s sharkey 
i say ’
‘that’s right ’ put in young tom  ‘why  they even took pimple’s old
ma  that lobelia  and he was fond of her  if no one else was  some of the
hobbiton folk  they saw it  she comes down the lane with her old umbrella  some
of the ruffians were going up with a big cart 
‘ “where be you a-going ” says she 
‘ “to bag end ” says they 
‘ “what for ” says she 
‘ “to put up some sheds for sharkey ” says they 
‘ “who said you could ” says she 
‘ “sharkey ” says they  “so get out o’ the road  old hagling ”
‘ “i’ll give you sharkey  you dirty thieving ruffians ” says she  and
ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader  near twice her size  so they took
her  dragged her off to the lockholes  at her age too  they’ve took others we
miss more  but there’s no denying she showed more spirit than most ’
into the middle of this talk came sam  bursting in with his gaffer  old
gamgee did not look much older  but he was a little deafer 
‘good evening  mr  baggins ’ he said  ‘glad indeed i am to see you safe
back  but i’ve a bone to pick with you  in a manner o’ speaking  if i may
make so bold  you didn’t never ought to have a’ sold bag end  as i always
said  that’s what started all the mischief  and while you’re been trapessing
in foreign parts  chasing black men up mountains from what my sam says  though
what for he don’t make clear  they’ve been and dug up bagshot row and ruined
my taters ’
‘i am very sorry  mr  gamgee ’ said frodo  ‘but now i’ve come back 
i’ll do my best to make amends ’
‘well  you can’t say fairer than that ’ said the gaffer  ‘mr  frodo
baggins is a real gentlehobbit  i always have said  whatever you may think of
some others of the name  begging your pardon  and i hope my sam’s behaved
hisself and given satisfaction ’
‘perfect satisfaction  mr  gamgee ’ said frodo  ‘indeed  if you will
believe it  he’s now one of the most famous people in all the lands  and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the sea and beyond the great
river ’ sam blushed  but he looked gratefully at frodo  for rosie’s eyes
were shining and she was smiling at him 
‘it takes a lot o’ believing ’ said the gaffer  ‘though i can see
he’s been mixing in strange company  what’s come of his weskit  i don’t
hold with wearing ironmongery  whether it wears well or no ’
farmer cotton’s household and all his guests were up early next morning 
nothing had been heard in the night  but more trouble would certainly come
before the day was old  ‘seems as if none o’ the ruffians were left up at
bag end ’ said cotton  ‘but the gang from waymeet will be along any time
now ’
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in  he was in high
spirits  ‘the thain has raised all our country ’ he said  ‘and the news is
going like fire all ways  the ruffians that were watching our land have fled off
south  those that escaped alive  the thain has gone after them  to hold off the
big gang down that way  but he’s sent mr peregrin back with all the other folk
he can spare ’
the next news was less good  merry  who had been out all night  came riding
in about ten o’clock  ‘there’s a big band about four miles away ’ he
said  ‘they’re coming along the road from waymeet  but a good many stray
ruffians have joined up with them  there must be close on a hundred of them  and
they’re fire-raising as they come  curse them ’
‘ah  this lot won’t stay to talk  they’ll kill  if they can ’ said
farmer cotton  ‘if tooks don’t come sooner  we’d best get behind cover and
shoot without arguing  there’s got to be some fighting before this is settled 
mr  frodo ’
the tooks did come sooner  before long they marched in  a hundred strong 
from tuckborough and the green hills with pippin at their head  merry now had
enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians  scouts reported that they were
keeping close together  they knew that the countryside had risen against them 
and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly  at its centre in
bywater  but however grim they  might be  they seemed to have no leader among
them who understood warfare  they came on without any precautions  merry laid
his plans quickly 
the ruffians came tramping along the east road  and without halting turned up
the bywater road  which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low
hedges on top  round a bend  about a furlong from the main road  they met a
stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned  that halted them  at the same moment
they became aware that the hedges on both sides  just above their heads  were
all lined with hobbits  behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more
waggons that had been hidden in a field  and so blocked the way back  a voice
spoke to them from above 
‘well  you have walked into a trap ’ said merry  ‘your fellows from
hobbiton did the same  and one is dead and the rest are prisoners  lay down your
weapons  then go back twenty paces and sit down  any who try to break out will
be shot ’
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily  a few of them obeyed  but
were immediately set on by their fellows  a score or more broke back and charged
the waggons  six were shot  but the remainder burst out  killing two hobbits 
and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end  two more
fell as they ran  merry blew a loud horn-call  and there were answering calls
from a distance 
‘they won’t get far ’ said pippin  ‘all that country is alive with
our hunters now ’
behind  the trapped men in the lane  still about four score  tried to climb
the barrier and the banks  and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or
hew them with axes  but many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the
west side  and attacked their enemies fiercely  being now more bent on killing
than escaping  several hobbits fell  and the rest were wavering  when merry and
pippin  who were on the east side  came across and charged the ruffians  merry
himself slew the leader  a great squint-eyed brute like a huge orc  then he drew
his forces off  encircling the last remnant of the men in a wide ring of
archers 
at last all was over  nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field 
and a dozen were prisoners  nineteen hobbits were killed  and some thirty were
wounded  the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off to an old
sand-pit nearby and there buried  in the battle pit  as it was afterwards
called  the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the hill-side  where
later a great stone was set up with a garden about it  so ended the battle of
bywater  1419  the last battle fought in the shire  and the only battle since
the greenfields  1147  away up in the northfarthing  in consequence  though it
happily cost very few lives  it has a chapter to itself in the red book  and the
names of all those who took part were made into a roll  and learned by heart by
shire-historians  the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the
cottons dates from this time  but at the top of the roll in all accounts stand
the names of captains meriadoc and peregrin 
frodo had been in the battle  but he had not drawn sword  and his chief part
had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses  from slaying
those of their enemies who threw down their weapons  when the fighting was over 
and the later labours were ordered  merry  pippin  and sam joined him  and they
rode back with the cottons  they ate a late midday meal  and then frodo said
with a sigh  ‘well  i suppose it is time now that we dealt with the
“chief” ’
‘yes indeed  the sooner the better ’ said merry  ‘and don’t be too
gentle  he’s responsible for bringing in these ruffians  and for all the evil
they have done ’
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits  ‘for
it’s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at bag end ’ he said  ‘we
don’t know ’ then they set out on foot  frodo  sam  merry  and pippin led
the way 
it was one of the saddest hours in their lives  the great chimney rose up
before them  and as they drew near the old village across the water  through
rows of new mean houses along each side of the road  they saw the new mill in
all its frowning and dirty ugliness  a great brick building straddling the
stream  which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow  all along the
bywater road every tree had been felled 
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped  even sam’s
vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw  the old grange on
the west side had been knocked down  and its place taken by rows of tarred
sheds  all the chestnuts were gone  the banks and hedgerows were broken  great
waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass  bagshot row
was a yawning sand and gravel quarry  bag end up  beyond could not be seen for a
clutter of large huts 
‘they’ve cut it down ’ cried sam  ‘they’ve cut down the party
tree ’ he pointed to where the tree  had stood under which bilbo had made his
farewell speech  it was lying lopped and dead in the field  as if this was the
last straw sam burst into tears 
a laugh put an end to them  there was a surly hobbit lounging over the low
wall of the mill-yard  he was grimy-faced and black-handed  ‘don’t ‘ee
like it  sam ’ he sneered  ‘but you always was soft  i thought you’d gone
off in one o’ them ships you used to prattle about  sailing  sailing  what
d’you want to come back for  we’ve work to do in the shire now ’
‘so i see ’ said sam  ‘no time for washing  but time for wall-propping 
but see here  master sandyman  i’ve a score to pay in this village  and
don’t you make it any longer with your jeering  or you’ll foot a bill too
big for your purse ’
ted sandyman spat over the wall  ‘garn ’ he said  ‘you can’t touch
me  i’m a friend o’ the boss’s  but he’ll touch you all right  if i have
any more of your mouth ’
‘don’t waste any more words on the fool  sam ’ said frodo  ‘i hope
there are not many more hobbits that have become like this  it would be a worse
trouble than all the damage the men have done ’
‘you are dirty and insolent  sandyman ’ said merry  ‘and also very much
out of your reckoning  we are just going up the hill to remove your precious
boss  we have dealt with his men ’
ted gaped  for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that at a
sign from merry now marched over the bridge  dashing back into the mill he ran
out with a horn and blew it loudly 
‘save your breath ’ laughed merry  ‘i’ve a better ’ then lifting up
his silver horn he winded it  and its clear call rang over the hill  and out of
the holes and sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton the hobbits answered  and came
pouring out  and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company up the
road to bag end 
at the top of the lane the party halted  and frodo and his friends went on 
and they came at last to the once beloved place  the garden was full of huts and
sheds  some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light 
there were piles of refuse everywhere  the door was scarred  the bell-chain was
dangling loose  and the bell would not ring  knocking brought no answer  at
length they pushed and the door yielded  they went in  the place stank and was
full of filth and disorder  it did not appear to have been used for some time 
‘where is that miserable lotho hiding ’ said merry  they had searched
every room and found no living thing save rats and mice  ‘shall we turn on the
others to search the sheds ’
‘this is worse than mordor ’ said sam  ‘much worse in a way  it comes
home to you  as they say  because it is home  and you remember it before it was
all ruined ’
‘yes  this is mordor ’ said frodo  ‘just one of its works  saruman was
doing its work all the time  even when he thought he was working for himself 
and the same with those that saruman tricked  like lotho ’
merry looked round in dismay and disgust  ‘let’s get out ’ he said 
‘if i had known all the mischief he had caused  i should have stuffed my pouch
down saruman’s throat ’
‘no doubt  no doubt  but you did not  and so i am able to welcome you
home ’ there standing at the door was saruman himself  looking well-fed and
well-pleased  his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement 
a sudden light broke on frodo  ‘sharkey ’ he cried 
saruman laughed  ‘so you have heard the name  have you  all my people used
to call me that in isengard  i believe  a sign of affection  possibly «
but evidently you did not expect to see me here ’
‘i did not ’ said frodo  ‘but i might have guessed  a little mischief
in a mean way  gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it 
‘quite capable ’ said saruman  ‘and more than a little  you made me
laugh  you hobbit-lordlings  riding along with all those great people so secure
and so pleased with your little selves  you thought you had done very well out
of it all  and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time in the
country  saruman’s home could be all wrecked  and he could be turned out  but
no one could touch yours  oh no  gandalf would look after your affairs ’
saruman laughed again  ‘not he  when his tools have done their task he
drops them  but you must go dangling after him  dawdling and talking  and riding
round twice as far as you needed  “well ” thought i  “if they’re such
fools  i will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson  one ill turn deserves
another ” it would have been a sharper lesson  if only you had given me a
little more time and more men  still i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives  and it will be pleasant to think of that
and set it against my injuries ’
‘well  if that is what you find pleasure in ’ said frodo  ‘i pity you 
it will be a pleasure of memory only  i fear  go at once and never return ’
the hobbits of the villages had seen saruman come out of one of the huts  and
at once they came crowding up to the door of bag end  when they heard frodo’s
command  they murmured angrily 
‘don’t let him go  kill him  he’s a villain and a murderer  kill
him ’
saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled  ‘kill him ’ he
mocked  ‘kill him  if you think there are enough of you  my brave hobbits ’
he drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes  ‘but do not
think that when i lost all my goods i lost all my power  whoever strikes me
shall be accursed  and if my blood stains the shire  it shall wither and never
again be healed ’
the hobbits recoiled  but frodo said  ‘do not believe him  he has lost all
power  save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you  if you let it 
but i will not have him slain  it is useless to meet revenge with revenge  it
will heal nothing  go  saruman  by the speediest way ’
‘worm  worm ’ saruman called  and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue 
crawling  almost like a dog  to the road again  worm ’ said saruman  ‘these
fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again  come along ’
saruman turned to go  and wormtongue shuffled after him  but even as saruman
passed close to frodo a knife flashed in his hand  and he stabbed swiftly  the
blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped  a dozen hobbits  led by sam 
leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground  sam drew his
sword 
‘no  sam ’ said frodo  ‘do not kill him even now  for he has not hurt
me  and in any case i do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood  he was
great once  of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against 
he is fallen  and his cure is beyond us  but i would still spare him  in the
hope that he may find it ’
saruman rose to his feet  and stared at frodo  there was a strange look in
his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred  ‘you have grown 
halfling ’ he said  ‘yes  you have grown very much  you are wise  and cruel 
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness  and now i must go hence in bitterness 
in debt to your mercy  i hate it and you  well  i go and i will trouble you no
more  but do not expect me to wish you health and long life  you will have
neither  but that is not my doing  i merely foretell ’
he walked away  and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass  but their
knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons  wormtongue hesitated  and
then followed his master 
‘wormtongue ’ called frodo  ‘you need not follow him  i know of no evil
you have done to me  you can have rest and food here for a while  until you are
stronger and can go your own ways ’
wormtongue halted and looked back at him  half prepared to stay  saruman
turned  ‘no evil ’ he cackled  ‘oh no  even when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars  but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding  you know  don’t you  worm  will you tell them ’
wormtongue cowered down and whimpered  ‘no  no ’
‘then i will ’ said saruman  ‘worm killed your chief  poor little
fellow  your nice little boss  didn’t you  worm  stabbed him in his sleep  i
believe  buried him  i hope  though worm has been very hungry lately  no  worm
is not really nice  you had better leave him to me ’
a look of wild hatred came into wormtongue’s red eyes  ‘you told me to 
you made me do it ’ he hissed 
saruman laughed  ‘you do what sharkey says  always  don’t you  worm 
well  now he says  follow ’ he kicked wormtongue in the face as he grovelled 
and turned and made off  but at that something snapped  suddenly wormtongue rose
up  drawing a hidden knife  and then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on
saruman’s back  jerked his head back  cut his throat  and with a yell ran off
down the lane  before frodo could recover or speak a word  three hobbit-bows
twanged and wormtongue fell dead 
to the dismay of those that stood by  about the body of saruman a grey mist
gathered  and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire  as a pale
shrouded figure it loomed over the hill  for a moment it wavered  looking to the
west  but out of the west came a cold wind  and it bent away  and with a sigh
dissolved into nothing 
frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror  for as he looked it
seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it  and it shrank  and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull  lifting up the
skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it  he covered it over  and turned
away 
‘and that’s the end of that ’ said sam  ‘a nasty end  and i wish i
needn’t have seen it  but it’s a good riddance ’
‘and the very last end of the war  i hope ’ said merry 
‘i hope so ’ said frodo and sighed  ‘the very last stroke  but to think
that it should fall here  at the very door of bag end  among all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that ’
‘i shan’t call it the end  till we’ve cleared up the mess ’ said sam
gloomily  ‘and that’ll take a lot of time and work ’
 
the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work  but it took less time than
sam had feared  the day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving and
released the prisoners from the lockholes  one of the first that they found was
poor fredegar bolger  fatty no longer  he had been taken when the ruffians
smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in the
brockenbores by the hills of scary 
‘you would have done better to come with us after all  poor old
fredegar ’ said pippin  as they carried him out too weak to walk 
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile  ‘who’s this young giant
with the loud voice ’ he whispered  ‘not little pippin  what’s your size
in hats now ’
then there was lobelia  poor thing  she looked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow cell  she insisted on hobbling out on her own
feet  and she had such a welcome  and there was such clapping and cheering when
she appeared  leaning on frodo’s arm but still clutching her umbrella  that
she was quite touched  and drove away in tears  she had never in her life been
popular before  but she was crushed by the news of lotho’s murder  and she
would’ not return to bag end  she gave it back to frodo  and went to her own
people  the bracegirdles of hardbottle 
when the poor creature died next spring-she was after all more than a hundred
years old - frodo was surprised and much moved  she had left all that remained
of her money and of lotho’s for him to use in helping hobbits made homeless by
the troubles  so that feud was ended 
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than any  and though he
had perhaps been treated less harshly than some  he needed a lot of feeding up
before he could look the part of mayor  so frodo agreed to act as his deputy 
until mr  whitfoot was in shape again  the only thing that he did as deputy
mayor was to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers  the
task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to merry and
pippin  and it was soon done  the southern gangs  after hearing the news of the
battle of bywater  fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the
thain  before the year’s end the few survivors were rounded up in the woods 
and those that surrendered were shown to the borders 
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace  and sam was kept very busy 
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them  now there
were thousands of willing hands of all ages  from the small but nimble ones of
the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of the gaffers and
gammers  before yule not a brick was left standing of the new shirriff-houses or
of anything that had been built by ‘sharkey’s men’  but the bricks were
used to repair many an old hole  to make it snugger and drier  great stores of
goods and food  and beer  were found that had been hidden away by the ruffians
in sheds and barns and deserted holes  and especially in the tunnels at michel
delving and in the old quarries at scary  so that there was a great deal better
cheer that yule than anyone had hoped for 
one of the first things done in hobbiton  before even the removal of the new
mill  was the clearing of the hill and bag end  and the restoration of bagshot
row  the front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into a large
sheltered garden  and new holes were dug in the southward face  back into the
hill  and they were lined with brick  the gaffer was restored to number three 
and he said often and did not care who heard it 
‘it’s an ill wind as blows nobody no good  as i always say  and all’s
well as ends better ’
there was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given  battle
gardens was thought of  or better smials  but after a while in
sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called new row  it was a purely
bywater joke to refer to it as sharkey’s end 
the trees were the worst loss and damage  for at sharkey’s bidding they had
been cut down recklessly far and wide over the shire  and sam grieved over this
more than anything else  for one thing  this hurt would take long to heal  and
only his great-grandchildren  he thought  would see the shire as it ought to be 
then suddenly one day  for he had been too busy for weeks to give a thought
to his adventures  he remembered the gift of galadriel  he brought the box out
and showed it to the other travellers  for so they were now called by everyone  
and asked their advice 
‘i wondered when you would think of it ’ said frodo  ‘open it ’
inside it was filled with a grey dust  soft and fine  in the middle of which
was a seed  like a small nut with a silver shale  ‘what can i do with this ’
said sam 
‘throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work ’ said
pippin 
‘on what ’ said sam 
‘choose one spot as a nursery  and see what happens to the plants there ’
said merry 
‘but i’m sure the lady would not like me to keep it all for my own
garden  now so many folk have suffered ’ said sam 
‘use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own  sam ’ said frodo 
‘and then use the gift to help your work and better it  and use it sparingly 
there is not much here  and i expect every grain has a value ’
so sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or
beloved trees had been destroyed  and he put a grain of the precious dust in the
soil at the root of each  he went up and down the shire in this labour  but if
he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him  and at the
end he found that he still had a little of the dust left  so he went to the
three-farthing stone  which is as near the centre of the shire as no matter  and
cast it in the air with his blessing  the little silver nut he planted in the
party field where the tree had once been  and he wondered what would come of it 
all through the winter he remained as patient as he could  and tried to restrain
himself from going round constantly to see if anything was happening 
spring surpassed his wildest hopes  his trees began to sprout and grow  as if
time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty  in the party
field a beautiful young sapling leaped up  it had silver bark and long leaves
and burst into golden flowers in april  it was indeed a mallorn  and it
was the wonder of the neighbourhood  in after years  as it grew in grace and
beauty  it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys to see it 
the only mallorn west of the mountains and east of the sea  and one of
the finest in the world 
altogether 1420 in the shire was a marvellous year  not only was there
wonderful sunshine and delicious rain  in due times and perfect measure  but
there seemed something more  an air of richness and growth  and a gleam of a
beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this
middle-earth  all the children born or begotten in that year  and there were
many  were fair to see and strong  and most of them had a rich golden hair that
had before been rare among hobbits  the fruit was so plentiful that young
hobbits very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream  and later they sat on the
lawns under the plum-trees and ate  until they had made piles of stones like
small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror  and then they moved on  and
no one was ill  and everyone was pleased  except those who had to mow the grass 
in the southfarthing the vines were laden  and the yield of ‘leaf’ was
astonishing  and everywhere there was so much corn that at harvest every barn
was stuffed  ‘the northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of 1420 malt
was long remembered and became a byword  indeed a generation later one might
hear an old gaffer in an inn  after a good pint of well-earned ale  put down his
mug with a sigh  ‘ah  that was proper fourteen-twenty  that was ’
sam stayed at first at the cottons’ with frodo  but when the new row was
ready he went with the gaffer  in addition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end  but he was often away in the
shire on his forestry work  so he was not at home in early march and did not
know that frodo had been ill  on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton
found frodo lying on his bed  he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain
about his neck and he seemed half in a dream 
‘it is gone for ever ’ he said  ‘and now all is dark and empty ’
but the fit passed  and when sam got back on the twenty-fifth  frodo had
recovered  and he said nothing about himself  in the meanwhile bag end had been
set in order  and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back all
the old furniture and gear  so that the old hole soon looked very much as it
always had done 
when all was at last ready frodo said  ‘when are you going to move in and
join me  sam ’
sam looked a bit awkward 
‘there is no need to come yet  if you don’t want to ’ said frodo 
‘but you know the gaffer is close at hand  and he will be very well looked
after by widow rumble ’
it s not that  mr  frodo  said sam  and he went very red 
‘well  what is it ’
‘it’s rosie  rose cotton ’ said sam  ‘it seems she didn’t like my
going abroad at all  poor lass  but as i hadn’t spoken  she couldn’t say so 
and i didn’t speak  because i had a job to do first  but now i have spoken 
and she says  “well  you’ve wasted a year  so why wait longer ”
“wasted ” i says  “i wouldn’t call it that ” still i see what she
means  i feel torn in two  as you might say ’
‘i see ’ said frodo  ‘you want to get married  and yet you want to live
with me in bag end too  but my dear sam  how easy  get married as soon as you
can  and then move in with rosie  there’s room enough in bag end for as big a
family as you could wish for ’
and so it was settled  sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring of 1420
 which was also famous for its weddings   and they came and lived at bag end 
and if sam thought himself lucky  frodo knew that he was more lucky himself  for
there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with such care  when
the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet
life  writing a great deal and going through all his notes  he resigned the
office of deputy mayor at the free fair that mid-summer  and dear old will
whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at banquets 
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow  and there was
much coming and going between buckland and bag end  the two young travellers cut
a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales and their finery  and
their wonderful parties  ‘lordly’ folk called them  meaning nothing but
good  for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts
so bright and their shields so splendid  laughing and singing songs of far away 
and if they were now large and magnificent  they were unchanged otherwise 
unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment
than ever before 
frodo and sam  however  went back to ordinary attire  except that when there
was need they both wore long grey cloaks  finely woven and clasped at the throat
with beautiful brooches  and mr  frodo wore always a white jewel on a chain that
he often would finger 
all things now went well  with hope always of becoming still better  and sam
was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish  nothing for him
marred that whole year  except for some vague anxiety about his master  frodo
dropped quietly out of all the doings of the shire  and sam was pained to notice
how little honour he had in his own country  few people knew or wanted to know
about his deeds and adventures  their admiration and respect were given mostly
to mr  meriadoc and mr  peregrin and  if sam had known it  to himself  also in
the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles 
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very
strange  he was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away 
‘what’s the matter  mr  frodo ’ said sam 
‘i am wounded ’ he answered  ‘wounded  it will never really heal ’
but then he got up  and the turn seemed to pass  and he was quite himself the
next day  it was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the date was
october the sixth  two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under
weathertop 
time went on  and 1421 came in  frodo was ill again in march  but with a
great effort he concealed it  for sam had other things to think about  the first
of sam and rosie’s children was born on the twenty-fifth of march  a date that
sam noted 
‘well  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘i’m in a bit of a fix  rose and me had
settled to call him frodo  with your leave  but it’s not him  it’s her 
though as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope for  taking after rose more
than me  luckily  so we don’t know what to do ’
‘well  sam ’ said frodo  ‘what’s wrong with the old customs  choose a
flower name like rose  half the maidchildren in the shire are called by such
names  and what could be better ’
‘i suppose you’re right  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘i’ve heard some
beautiful names on my travels  but i suppose they’re a bit too grand for daily
wear and tear  as you might say  the gaffer  he says  “make it short  and then
you won’t have to cut it short before you can use it ” but if it’s to be a
flower-name  then i don’t trouble about the length  it must be a beautiful
flower  because  you see  i think she is very beautiful  and is going to be
beautifuller still ’
frodo thought for a moment  ‘well  sam  what about elanor 
the sun-star  you remember the little golden flower in the grass of lothlórien ’
‘you’re right again  mr  frodo ’ said sam delighted  ‘that’s what i
wanted ’
little elanor was nearly six months old  and 1421 had passed to its autumn 
when frodo called sam into the study 
‘it will be bilbo’s birthday on thursday  sam ’ he said  ‘and he will
pass the old took  he will be a hundred and thirty-one ’
‘so he will ’ said sam  ‘he’s a marvel ’
‘well  sam ’ said frodo  ‘i want you to see rose and find out if she
can spare you  so that you and i can go off together  you can’t go far or for
a long time now  of course ’ he said a little wistfully 
‘well  not very well  mr  frodo ’
‘of course not  but never mind  you can see me on my way  tell rose that
you won’t be away very long  not more than a fortnight  and you’ll come back
quite safe ’
‘i wish i could go all the way with you to rivendell  mr  frodo  and see
mr  bilbo ’ said sam  ‘and yet the only place i really want to be in is
here  i am that torn in two ’
‘poor sam  it will feel like that  i am afraid ’ said frodo  ‘but you
will be healed  you were meant to be solid and whole  and you will be ’
in the next day or two frodo went through his papers and his writings with
sam  and he handed over his keys  there was a big book with plain red leather
covers  its tall pages were now almost filled  at the beginning there were many
leaves covered with bilbo’s thin wandering hand  but most of it was written in
frodo’s firm flowing script  it was divided into chapters but chapter 80 was
unfinished  and after that were some blank leaves  the title page had many
titles on it  crossed out one after another  so 
my diary  my unexpected journey  there and back again  and what happened
after 
adventures of five hobbits  the tale of the great ring  compiled by bilbo
baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his friends  what we did
in the war of the ring 
here bilbo’s hand ended and frodo had written 
the downfall

of the

lord of the rings

and the

return of the king

 as seen by the little people  being the memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the
shire  supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of the
wise  
together with extracts from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivendell 
‘why  you have nearly finished it  mr  frodo ’ sam exclaimed  ‘well 
you have kept at it  i must say ’
‘i have quite finished  sam ’ said frodo  ‘the last pages are for
you ’
on september the twenty-first they set out together  frodo on the pony that
had borne him all the way from minas tirith  and was now called strider  and sam
on his beloved bill  it was a fair golden morning  and sam did not ask where
they were going  he thought he could guess 
they took the stock road over the hills and went towards the woody end  and
they let their ponies walk at their leisure  they camped in the green hills  and
on september the twenty-second they rode gently down into the beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away 
‘if that isn’t the very tree you hid behind when the black rider first
showed up  mr  frodo ’ said sam pointing to the left  ‘it seems like a dream
now ’
it was evening  and the stars were glimmering in the eastern sky as they
passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the hill between the
hazel-thickets  sam was silent  deep in his memories  presently he became aware
that frodo was singing softly to himself  singing the old walking-song  but the
words were not quite the same 
still round the corner there may wait

a new road or a secret gate 

and though i oft have passed them by 

a day will come at last when i

shall take the hidden paths that run

west of the moon  east of the sun 
and as if in answer  from down below  coming up the road out of the valley 
voices sang 
a  elbereth gilthoniel 

silivren penna míriel

o menel aglar elenath 

gilthoniel  a  elbereth 

 
we still remember  we who dwell

in this far land beneath the trees

the starlight on the western seas 
frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows  until they saw a
shimmer as the travellers came towards them 
there was gildor and many fair elven folk  and there to sam’s wonder rode
elrond and galadriel  elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his
forehead  and a silver harp was in his hand  and upon his finger was a ring of
gold with a great blue stone  vilya  mightiest of the three  but galadriel sat
upon a white palfrey and was robed all in glimmering white  like clouds about
the moon  for she herself seemed to shine with a soft light  on her finger was
nenya  the ring wrought of mithril  that bore a single white stone
flickering like a frosty star  riding slowly behind on a small grey pony  and
seeming to nod in his sleep  was bilbo himself 
elrond greeted them gravely and graciously  and galadriel smiled upon them 
‘well  master samwise ’ she said  ‘i hear and see that you have used my
gift well  the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved ’ sam
bowed  but found nothing to say  he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was 
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes  ‘hullo  frodo ’ he said  ‘well 
i have passed the old took today  so that’s settled  and now i think i am
quite ready to go on another journey  are you coming ’
‘yes  i am coming ’ said frodo  ‘the ring-bearers should go
together ’
‘where are you going  master ’ cried sam  though at last he understood
what was happening 
‘to the havens  sam ’ said frodo 
‘and i can’t come ’
‘no  sam  not yet anyway  not further than the havens  though you too were
a ring-bearer  if only for a little while  your time may come  do not be too
sad  sam  you cannot be always torn in two  you will have to be one and whole 
for many years  you have so much to enjoy and to be  and to do ’
‘but ’ said sam  and tears started in his eyes  ‘i thought you were
going to enjoy the shire  too  for years and years  after all you have done ’
‘so i thought too  once  but i have been too deeply hurt  sam  i tried to
save the shire  and it has been saved  but not for me  it must often be so  sam 
when things are in danger  some one has to give them up  lose them  so that
others may keep them  but you are my heir  all that i had and might have had i
leave to you  and also you have rose  and elanor  and frodo-lad will come  and
rosie-lass  and merry  and goldilocks  and pippin  and perhaps more that i
cannot see  your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere  you will be the
mayor  of course  as long as you want to be  and the most famous gardener in
history  and you will read things out of the red book  and keep alive the memory
of the age that is gone  so that people will remember the great danger and so
love their beloved land all the more  and that will keep you as busy and as
happy as anyone can be  as long as your part of the story goes on 
‘come now  ride with me ’
then elrond and galadriel rode on  for the third age was over  and the days
of the rings were passed  and an end was come of the story and song of those
times  with them went many elves of the high kindred who would no longer stay in
middle-earth  and among them  filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and
without bitterness  rode sam  and frodo  and bilbo  and the elves delighted to
honour them 
though they rode through the midst of the shire all the evening and all the
night  none saw them pass  save the wild creatures  or here and there some
wanderer in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the trees  or a light and
shadow flowing through the grass as the moon went westward  and when they had
passed from the shire  going about the south skirts of the white downs  they
came to the far downs  and to the towers  and looked on the distant sea  and so
they rode down at last to mithlond  to the grey havens in the long firth of
lune 
as they came to the gates círdan the shipwright came forth to greet
them  very tall he was  and his beard was long  and he was grey and old 
save that his eyes were keen as stars  and he looked at them and bowed  and
said  ‘all is now ready ’
then círdan led them to the havens  and there was a white ship lying 
and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in
white awaiting them  as he turned and came towards them frodo saw that gandalf
now wore openly upon his hand the third ring  narya the great  and the stone
upon it was red as fire  then those who were to go were glad  for they knew that
gandalf also would take ship with them 
but sam was now sorrowful at heart  and it seemed to him that if the parting
would be bitter  more grievous still would be the long road home alone  but even
as they stood there  and the elves were going aboard  and all was being made
ready to depart  up rode merry and pippin in great haste  and amid his tears
pippin laughed 
‘you tried to give us the slip once before and failed  frodo ’ he said 
‘this time you have nearly succeeded  but you have failed again  it was not
sam  though  that gave you away this time  but gandalf himself ’
‘yes ’ said gandalf  ‘for it will be better to ride back three together
‘than one alone  well  here at last  dear friends  on the shores of the sea
comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth  go in peace  i will not say  do
not weep  for not all tears are an evil ’
then frodo kissed merry and pippin  and last of all sam  and went aboard  and
the sails were drawn up  and the wind blew  and slowly the ship slipped away
down the long grey firth  and the light of the glass of galadriel that frodo
bore glimmered and was lost  and the ship went out into the high sea and passed
on into the west  until at last on a night of rain frodo smelled a sweet
fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water 
and then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of bombadil  the
grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back  and he beheld
white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise 
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven  and as
he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost
in the west  there still he stood far into the night  hearing only the sigh and
murmur of the waves on the shores of middle-earth  and the sound of them sank
deep into his heart  beside him stood merry and pippin  and they were silent 
at last the three companions turned away  and never again looking back they
rode slowly homewards  and they spoke no word to one another until they came
back to the shire  but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey
road 
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road  and then merry and
pippin rode on to buckland  and already they were singing again as they went 
but sam turned to bywater  and so came back up the hill  as day was ending once
more  and he went on  and there was yellow light  and fire within  and the
evening meal was ready  and he was expected  and rose drew him in  and set him
in his chair  and put little elanor upon his lap 
he drew a deep breath  ‘well  i’m back ’ he said
