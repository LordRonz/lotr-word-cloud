pippin looked out from the shelter of gandalf’s cloak  he wondered if he
was awake or still sleeping  still in the swift-moving dream in which he had
been wrapped so long since the great ride began  the dark world was rushing by
and the wind sang loudly in his ears  he could see nothing but the wheeling
stars  and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of
the south marched past  sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their journey  but his memory was drowsy and uncertain 
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt  and then in
the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold  and they had come to the silent town
and the great empty house on the hill  and hardly had they reached its shelter
when the winged shadow had passed over once again  and men wilted with fear  but
gandalf had spoken soft words to him  and he had slept in a corner  tired but
uneasy  dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving
orders  and then again riding  riding in the night  this was the second  no  the
third night since he had looked in the stone  and with that hideous memory he
woke fully  and shivered  and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing
voices 
a light kindled in the sky  a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers
pippin cowered back  afraid for a moment  wondering into what dreadful country
gandalf was bearing him  he rubbed his eyes  and then he saw that it was the
moon rising above the eastern shadows  now almost at the full  so the night was
not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on  he stirred and spoke 
‘where are we  gandalf ’ he asked 
‘in the realm of gondor ’ the wizard answered  ‘the land of anórien
is still passing by ’
there was a silence again for a while  then  ‘what is that ’ cried pippin
suddenly  clutching at gandalf’s cloak  ‘look  fire  red fire  are there
dragons in this land  look  there is another ’
for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse  ‘on  shadowfax  we must hasten 
time is short  see  the beacons of gondor are alight  calling for aid  war is
kindled  see  there is the fire on amon dîn  and flame on eilenach  and
there they go speeding west  nardol  erelas  min-rimmon  calenhad  and the
halifirien on the borders of rohan ’
but shadowfax paused in his stride  slowing to a walk  and then he lifted up
his head and neighed  and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses came  and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard  and three riders
swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the west 
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away  and the night flowed
over him like a roaring wind 
pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf telling him
of the customs of gondor  and how the lord of the city had beacons built on the
tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range  and maintained
posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his
errand-riders to rohan in the north  or to belfalas in the south  ‘it is long
since the beacons of the north were lit ’ he said  ‘and in the ancient days
of gondor they were not needed  for they had the seven stones ’ pippin stirred
uneasily 
‘sleep again  and do not be afraid ’ said gandalf  ‘for you are not
going like frodo to mordor  but to minas tirith  and there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere in these days  if gondor falls  or the ring is taken 
then the shire will be no refuge ’
‘you do not comfort me ’ said pippin  but nonetheless sleep crept over
him  the last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a
glimpse of high white peaks  glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as
they caught the light of the westering moon  he wondered where frodo was  and if
he was already in mordor  or if he was dead  and he did not know that frodo from
far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of the
day 
pippin woke to the sound of voices  another day of hiding and a night of
journey had fleeted by  it was twilight  the cold dawn was at hand again  and
chill grey mists were about them  shadowfax stood steaming with sweat  but he
held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness  many tall men heavily
cloaked stood beside him  and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone 
partly ruinous it seemed  but already before the night was passed the sound of
hurried labour could be heard  beat of hammers  clink of trowels  and the creak
of wheels  torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog  gandalf
was speaking to the men that barred his way  and as he listened pippin became
aware that he himself was being discussed 
‘yea truly  we know you  mithrandir ’ said the leader of the men  ‘and
you know the pass-words of the seven gates and are free to go forward  but we do
not know your companion  what is he  a dwarf out of the mountains in the north 
we wish for no strangers in the land at this time  unless they be mighty men of
arms in whose faith and help we can trust ’
‘i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor ’ said gandalf  ‘and
as for valour  that cannot be computed by stature  he has passed through more
battles and perils than you have  ingold  though you be twice his height  and he
comes now from the storming of isengard  of which we bear tidings  and great
weariness is on him  or i would wake him  his name is peregrin  a very valiant
man ’
‘man ’ said ingold dubiously  and the others laughed 
‘man ’ cried pippin  now thoroughly roused  ‘man  indeed not  i am a
hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man  save perhaps now and again by
necessity  do not let gandalf deceive you ’
‘many a doer of great deeds might say no more ’ said ingold  ‘but what
is a hobbit ’
‘a halfling ’ answered gandalf  ‘nay  not the one that was spoken
of ’ he added seeing the wonder in the men’s faces  ‘not he  yet one of
his kindred ’
‘yes  and one who journeyed with him ’ said pippin  ‘and boromir of
your city was with us  and he saved me in the snows of the north  and at the
last he was slain defending me from many foes ’
‘peace ’ said gandalf  ‘the news of that grief should have been told
first to the father ’
‘it has been guessed already ’ said ingold  ‘for there have been
strange portents here of late  but pass on now quickly  for the lord of minas
tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son  be he
man or-‘
‘hobbit ’ said pippin  ‘little service can i offer to your lord  but
what i can do  i would do  remembering boromir the brave ’
‘fare you well ’ said ingold  and the men made way for shadow fax  and he
passed through a narrow gate in the wall  ‘may you bring good counsel to
denethor in his need  and to us all  mithrandir ’ ingold cried  ‘but you
come with tidings of grief and danger  as is your wont  they say ’
‘because i come seldom but when my help is needed ’ answered gandalf 
‘and as for counsel  to you i would say that you are over-late in repairing
the wall of the pelennor  courage will now be your best defence against the
storm that is at hand - that and such hope as i bring  for not all the tidings
that i bring are evil  but leave your trowels and sharpen your swords ’
‘the work will be finished ere evening ’ said ingold  ‘this is the last
portion of the wall to be put in defence  the least open to attack  for it looks
towards our friends of rohan  do you know aught of them  will they answer the
summons  think you ’
‘yes  they will come  but they have fought many battles at your back  this
road and no road looks towards safety any longer  be vigilant  but
for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of anórien
and no riders of rohan  and you may yet  fare you well  and sleep not ’
gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the rammas echor  so the men of
gondor called the out wall that they had built with great labour  after ithilien
fell under the shadow of their enemy  for ten leagues or more it ran from the
mountains’ feet and so back again  enclosing in its fence the fields of the
pelennor  fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes and terraces falling to
the deep levels of the anduin  at its furthest point from the great gate of the
city  north-eastward  the wall was four leagues distant  and there from a
frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river  and men had made it
high and strong  for at that point  upon a walled causeway  the road came in
from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and passed through a guarded gate
between embattled towers  at its nearest point the wall was little more than one
league from the city  and that was south-eastward  there anduin  going in a wide
knee about the hills of emyn arnen in south ithilien  bent sharply west  and the
out-wall rose upon its very brink  and beneath it lay the quays and landings of
the harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs 
the townlands were rich  with wide tilth and many orchards  and homesteads
there were with oast and garner  fold and byre  and many rills rippling through
the green from the highlands down to anduin  yet the herdsmen and husbandmen
that dwelt there were not many  and the most part of the people of gondor lived
in the seven circles of the city  or in the high vales of the mountain-borders 
in lossarnach  or further south in fair lebennin with its five swift streams 
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea  they were reckoned
men of gondor  yet their blood was mingled  and there were short and swarthy
folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the
shadow of the hills in the dark years ere the coming of the kings  but beyond 
in the great fief of belfalas  dwelt prince imrahil in his castle of dol amroth
by the sea  and he was of high blood  and his folk also  tall men and proud with
sea-grey eyes 
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky 
and pippin roused himself and looked up  to his left lay a sea of mist  rising
to a bleak shadow in the east  but to his right great mountains reared their
heads  ranging from the west to a steep and sudden end  as if in the making of
the land the river had burst through a great barrier  carving out a mighty
valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come  and there where the
white mountains of ered nimrais came to their end he saw  as gandalf had
promised  the dark mass of mount mindolluin  the deep purple shadows of its high
glens  and its tall face whitening in the rising day  and upon its out-thrust
knee was the guarded city  with its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the
earth 
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white 
blushing faintly in the dawn  and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern
shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the city  then pippin cried
aloud  for the tower of ecthelion  standing high within the topmost walls’
shone out against the sky  glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver  tall and
fair and shapely  and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals 
and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning
breeze’ and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets 
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the
rising of the sun  and its iron doors rolled back before them 
‘mithrandir  mithrandir ’ men cried  ‘now we know that the storm is
indeed nigh ’
‘it is upon you ’ said gandalf  ‘i have ridden on its wings  let me
pass  i must come to your lord denethor  while his stewardship lasts  whatever
betide  you have come to the end of the gondor that you have known  let me
pass ’
then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no
further  though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at
the horse that bore him  for the people of the city used horses very little and
they were seldom seen in their streets  save only those ridden by the
errand-riders of their lord  and they said  ‘surely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of rohan  maybe the rohirrim will come soon to strengthen
us ’ but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road 
for the fashion of minas tirith was such that it was built on seven levels 
each delved into the hill  and about each was set a wall  and in each wall was a
gate  but the gates were not set in a line  the great gate in the city wall was
at the east point of the circuit  but the next faced half south  and the third
half north  and so to and fro upwards  so that the paved way that climbed
towards the citadel turned first this way and then that across the face of the
hill  and each time that it passed the line of the great gate it went through an
arched tunnel  piercing a vast pier of rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided
in two all the circles of the city save the first  for partly in the primeval
shaping of the hill  partly by the mighty craft and labour of old  there stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the gate a towering bastion of stone 
its edge sharp as a ship-keel facing east  up it rose  even to the level of the
topmost circle  and there was crowned by a battlement  so that those in the
citadel might  like mariners in a mountainous ship  look from its peak sheer
down upon the gate seven hundred feet below  the entrance to the citadel also
looked eastward  but was delved in the heart of the rock  thence a long lamp-lit
slope ran up to the seventh gate  thus men reached at last the high court  and
the place of the fountain before the feet of the white tower  tall and shapely 
fifty fathoms from its base to the pinnacle  where the banner of the stewards
floated a thousand feet above the plain 
a strong citadel it was indeed  and not to be taken by a host of enemies  if
there were any within that could hold weapons  unless some foe could come behind
and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin  and so come upon the narrow shoulder
that joined the hill of guard to the mountain mass  but that shoulder  which
rose to the height of the fifth wall  was hedged with great ramparts right up to
the precipice that overhung its western end  and in that space stood the houses
and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords  for ever silent between the mountain
and the tower 
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city  vaster and more
splendid than anything that he had dreamed of  greater and stronger than
isengard  and far more beautiful  yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay  and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there 
in every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and
arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes  names
pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there  and yet now
they were silent  and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements  nor voice was
heard in their halls  nor any face looked out from door or empty window 
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate  and the warm sun that
shone down beyond the river  as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien  glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars  and the great arch with keystone
carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head  gandalf dismounted  for no
horse was allowed in the citadel  and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away
at the soft word of his master 
the guards of the gate were robed in black  and their helms were of strange
shape  high-crowned  with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face  and above
the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds  but the helms gleamed
with a flame of silver  for they were indeed wrought of mithril 
heirlooms from the glory of old days  upon the black surcoats were embroidered
in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many-pointed
stars  this was the livery of the heirs of elendil  and none wore it now in all
gondor  save the guards of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown 
already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them  and at once
they were admitted  silently  and without question  quickly gandalf strode
across the white-paved court  a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun 
and a sward of bright green lay about it  but in the midst  drooping over the
pool  stood a dead tree  and the falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and
broken branches back into the clear water 
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf  it looked mournful  he
thought  and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where
everything else was well tended 
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree 
the words that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind  and then he
found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower  and
behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the house of stone 
they walked down a paved passage  long and empty  and as they went gandalf
spoke softly to pippin  ‘be careful of your words  master peregrin  this is no
time for hobbit pertness  théoden is a kindly old man  denethor is
of another sort  proud and subtle  a man of far greater lineage and power 
though he is not called a king  but he will speak most to you  and question you
much  since you can tell him of his son boromir  he loved him greatly  too much
perhaps  and the more so because they were unlike  but under cover of this love
he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me 
do not tell him more than you need  and leave quiet the matter of frodo’s
errand  i will deal with that in due time  and say nothing about aragorn either 
unless you must ’
‘why not  what is wrong with strider ’ pippin whispered  ‘he meant to
come here  didn’t he  and he’ll be arriving soon himself anyway ’
‘maybe  maybe ’ said gandalf  ‘though if he comes  it is likely to be
in some way that no one expects  not even denethor  it will be better so  at
least he should come unheralded by us ’
gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal  ‘see  master pippin 
there is no time to instruct you now in the history of gondor  though it might
have been better  if you had learned something of it  when you were still
birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire  do as i bid  it is
scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord
to speak over much of the coming of one who will  if he comes  claim the
kingship  is that enough ’
‘kingship ’ said pippin amazed 
‘yes ’ said gandalf  ‘if you have walked all these days with closed
ears and mind asleep  wake up now ’ he knocked on the door 
the door opened  but no one could be seen to open it  pippin looked into a
great hall  it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either side  beyond
the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof  monoliths of black marble  they
rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of beasts and leaves  and
far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold  inset with flowing
traceries of many colours  no hangings nor storied webs  nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood  were to be seen in that long solemn hall  but between the
pillars there stood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone 
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath  and awe fell on
him  as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead  at the far end upon a
dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped like a
crowned helm  behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a
tree in flower  but the throne was empty  at the foot of the dais  upon the
lowest step which was broad and deep  there was a stone chair  black and
unadorned  and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap  in his hand was a white
rod with a golden knob  he did not look up  solemnly they paced the long floor
towards him  until they stood three paces from his footstool  then gandalf
spoke 
‘hail  lord and steward of minas tirith  denethor son of ecthelion  i am
come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour ’
then the old man looked up  pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones
and skin like ivory  and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes  and he
was reminded not so much of boromir as of aragorn  ‘dark indeed is the
hour ’ said the old man  ‘and at such times you are wont to come 
mithrandir  but though all the signs forebode that the doom of gondor is drawing
nigh  less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness  it has been told to
me that you bring with you one who saw my son die  is this he ’
‘it is ’ said gandalf  ‘one of the twain  the other is with théoden
of rohan and may come hereafter  halflings they are  as you see  yet this is not
he of whom the omens spoke ’
‘yet a halfling still ’ said denethor grimly  ‘and little love do i
bear the name  since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew
away my son on the wild errand to his death  my boromir  now we have need of
you  faramir should have gone in his stead ’
‘he would have gone ’ said gandalf  ‘be not unjust in your grief 
boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it  he was a
masterful man  and one to take what he desired  i journeyed far with him and
learned much of his mood  but you speak of his death  you have had news of that
ere we came ’
‘i have received this ’ said denethor  and laying down his rod he lifted
from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at  in each hand he held up one
half of a great horn cloven through the middle  a wild-ox horn bound with
silver 
‘that is the horn that boromir always wore ’ cried pippin 
‘verily ’ said denethor  ‘and in my turn i
bore it  and so did each eldest son of our house  far back into the vanished
years before the failing of the kings  since vorondil father of mardil hunted
the wild kine of araw in the far fields of rhûn  i heard it blowing dim
upon the northern marches thirteen days ago  and the river brought it to
me  broken  it will wind no more ’ he paused and there was a heavy silence 
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin  ‘what say you to that 
halfling ’
‘thirteen  thirteen days ’ faltered pippin  ‘yes  i think that would be
so  yes  i stood beside him  as he blew the horn  but no help came  only more
orcs ’
‘so ’ said denethor  looking keenly at pippin’s face  ‘you were
there  tell me more  why did no help come  and how did you escape  and yet he
did not  so mighty a man as he was  and only orcs to withstand him ’
pippin flushed and forgot his fear  ‘the mightiest man may be slain by one
arrow ’ he said  ‘and boromir was pierced by many  when last i saw him he
sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side  then i
swooned and was made captive  i saw him no more  and know no more  but i honour
his memory  for he was very valiant  he died to save us  my kinsman meriadoc and
myself  waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark lord  and though he
fell and failed  my gratitude is none the less ’
then pippin looked the old man in the eye  for pride stirred strangely within
him  still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice  ‘little
service  no doubt  will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit  a
halfling from the northern shire  yet such as it is  i will offer it  in payment
of my debt ’ twitching aside his grey cloak  pippin drew forth his small sword
and laid it at denethor’s feet 
a pale smile  like a gleam of cold sun on a winter’s evening  passed over
the old man’s face  but he bent his head and held out his hand  laying the
shards of the horn aside  ‘give me the weapon ’ he said 
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him  ‘whence came this ’ said
denethor  ‘many  many years lie on it  surely this is a blade wrought by our
own kindred in the north in the deep past ’
‘it came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ‘ said
pippin  ‘but only evil wights dwell there now  and i will not willingly tell
more of them ’
‘i see that strange tales are woven about you ’ said denethor  ‘and
once again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling  i accept
your service  for you are not daunted by words  and you have courteous speech 
strange though the sound of it may be to us in the south  and we shall have need
of all folk of courtesy  be they great or small  in the days to come  swear to
me now ’
‘take the hilt ’ said gandalf  ‘and speak after the lord  if you are
resolved on this ’
‘i am ’ said pippin 
the old man laid the sword along his lap  and pippin put his hand to the
hilt  and said slowly after denethor 
‘here do i swear fealty and service to gondor  and to the lord and steward
of the realm  to speak and to be silent  to do and to let be  to come and to go 
in need or plenty  in peace or war  in living or dying  from this hour
henceforth  until my lord release me  or death take me  or the world end  so say
i  peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings ’
and this do i hear  denethor son of ecthelion  lord of gondor  steward of the
high king  and i will not forget it  nor fail to reward that which is given 
fealty with love  valour with honour  oath-breaking with vengeance ’ then
pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath 
‘and now ’ said denethor  ‘my first command to you  speak and be not
silent  tell me your full tale  and see that you recall all that you can of
boromir  my son  sit now and begin ’ as he spoke he struck a small silver gong
that stood near his footstool  and at once servants came forward  pippin saw
then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door  unseen
as he and gandalf entered 
‘bring wine and food and seats for the guests ’ said denethor  ‘and see
that none trouble us for one hour ’
‘it is all that i have to spare  for there is much else to heed ’ he said
to gandalf  ‘much of more import  it may seem  and yet to me less pressing 
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day ’
‘and earlier  it is to be hoped ’ said
gandalf  ‘for i have not ridden hither from isengard  one hundred and fifty
leagues  with the speed of wind  only to bring you one small warrior  however
courteous  is it naught to you that théoden has fought a great battle and
that isengard is overthrown  and that i have broken the staff of
saruman ’
‘it is much to me  but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my own
counsel against the menace of the east ’ he turned his dark eyes on gandalf 
and now pippin saw a likeness between the two  and he felt the strain between
them  almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire  drawn from eye to eye 
that might suddenly burst into flame 
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than gandalf did  more
kingly  beautiful  and powerful  and older  yet by a sense other than sight
pippin perceived that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom  and a
majesty that was veiled  and he was older  far older  ‘how much older ’ he
wondered  and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it
before  treebeard had said something about wizards  but even then he had not
thought of gandalf as one of them  what was gandalf  in what far time and place
did he come into the world  and when would he leave it  and then his musings
broke off  and he saw that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the
eye  as if reading the other’s mind  but it was denethor who first withdrew
his gaze 
‘yea ’ he said  ‘for though the stones be lost  they say  still the
lords of gondor have keener sight than lesser men  and many messages come to
them  but sit now ’
then men came bearing a chair and a low stool  and one brought a salver with
a silver flagon and cups  and white cakes  pippin sat down  but he could not
take his eyes from the old lord  was it so  or had he only imagined it  that as
he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon pippin’s
face 
‘now tell me your tale  my liege ’ said denethor  half kindly  half
mockingly  ‘for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome
indeed ’
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the
lord of gondor  stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions  and all the while
conscious of gandalf at his side  watching and listening  and  so pippin felt 
holding in check a rising wrath and impatience  when the hour was over and
denethor again rang the gong  pippin felt worn out  ‘it cannot be more than
nine o’clock ’ he thought  ‘i could now eat three breakfasts on end ’
‘lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for him ’ said
denethor  ‘and his companion may lodge with him for the present  if he will 
but be it known that i have now sworn him to my service  and he shall be known
as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser pass-words  send word to the
captains that they shall wait on me here  as soon as may be after the third hour
has rung 
‘and you  my lord mithrandir  shall come too  as and when you will  none
shall hinder your coming to me at any time  save only in my brief hours of
sleep  let your wrath at an old man’s folly run off and then return to my
comfort ’
‘folly ’ said gandalf  ‘nay  my lord  when you are a dotard you will
die  you can use even your grief as a cloak  do you think that i do not
understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least 
while i sit by ’
‘if you understand it  then be content ’ returned denethor  ‘pride
would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need  but you deal out such
gifts according to your own designs  yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other men’s purposes  however worthy  and to him there is no
purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of gondor  and the
rule of gondor  my lord  is mine and no other man’s  unless the king should
come again ’
‘unless the king should come again ’ said gandalf  ‘well  my lord
steward  it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event  which
few now look to see  in that task you shall have all the aid that you are
pleased to ask for  but i will say this  the rule of no realm is mine  neither
of gondor nor any other  great or small  but all worthy things that are in peril
as the world now stands  those are my care  and for my part  i shall not wholly
fail of my task  though gondor should perish  if anything passes through this
night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come 
for i also am a steward  did you not know ’ and with that he turned and strode
from the hall with pippin running at his side 
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word to him as they went  their
guide brought them from the doors of the hall  and then led them across the
court of the fountain into a lane between tall buildings of stone  after several
turns they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side 
not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain  within  upon
the first floor above the street  up a wide carven stair  he showed them to a
fair room  light and airy  with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured  it
was sparely furnished  having but a small table  two chairs and a bench  but at
either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels
and basins for washing  there were three high narrow windows that looked
northward over the great curve of anduin  still shrouded in mists  towards the
emyn muil and rauros far away  pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over
the deep stone sill 
‘are you angry with me  gandalf ’ he said  as their guide went out and
closed the door  ‘i did the best i could ’
‘you did indeed ’ said gandalf  laughing suddenly  and he came and stood
beside pippin  putting his arm about the hobbit’s shoulders and gazing out of
the window  pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own 
for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry  yet in the wizard’s face
he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow  though as he looked more intently
he perceived that under all there was a great joy  a fountain of mirth enough to
set a kingdom laughing  were it to gush forth 
‘indeed you did your best ’ said the wizard  ‘and i hope that it may be
long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such
terrible old men  still the lord of gondor learned more from you than you may
have guessed  pippin  you could not hide the fact that boromir did not lead the
company from moria  and that there was one among you of high honour who was
coming to minas tirith  and that he had a famous sword  men think much about the
stories of old days in gondor  and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildur’s bane  since boromir went away 
‘he is not as other men of this time  pippin  and whatever be his descent
from father to son  by some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him  as it does in his other son  faramir  and yet did not in boromir whom he
loved best  he has long sight  he can perceive  if he bends his will thither 
much of what is passing in the minds of men  even of those that dwell far off 
it is difficult to deceive him  and dangerous to try 
‘remember that  for you are now sworn to his service  i do not know what
put it into your head  or your heart  to do that  but it was well done  i did
not hinder it  for generous deed should not be checked by cold counsel  it
touched his heart  as well  may i say it  as pleasing his humour  and at least
you are free now to move about as you will in minas tirith - when you are not on
duty  for there is another side to it  you are at his command  and he will not
forget  be wary still ’
he fell silent and sighed  ‘well  no need to brood on what tomorrow may
bring  for one thing  tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today  for
many days to come  and there is nothing more that i can do to help it  the board
is set  and the pieces are moving  one piece that i greatly desire to find is
faramir  now the heir of denethor  i do not think that he is in the city  but i
have had no time to gather news  i must go  pippin  i must go to this lords’
council and learn what i can  but the enemy has the move  and he is about to
open his full game  and pawns are likely to see as much of it as any  peregrin
son of paladin  soldier of gondor  sharpen your blade ’
gandalf went to the door  and there he turned  ‘i am in haste pippin ’ he
said  ‘do me a favour when you go out  even before you rest  if you are not
too weary  go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed  these people are
kindly to beasts  for they are a good and wise folk  but they have less skill
with horses than some ’
with that gandalf went out  and as he did so  there came the note of a clear
sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel  three strokes it rang  like silver
in the air  and ceased  the third hour from the rising of the sun 
after a minute pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about
the street  the sun was now shining warm and bright  and the towers and tall
houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward  high in the blue air mount
mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak  armed men went to and fro in
the ways of the city  as if going at the striking of the hour to changes of post
and duty 
‘nine o’clock we’d call it in the shire ’ said pippin aloud to
himself  ‘just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring
sunshine  and how i should like breakfast  do these people ever have it  or is
it over  and when do they have dinner  and where ’
presently he noticed a man  clad in black and white  coming along the narrow
street from the centre of the citadel towards him  pippin felt lonely and made
up his mind to speak as the man passed  but he had no need  the man came
straight up to him 
‘you are peregrin the halfling ’ he said  ‘i am told that you have been
sworn to the service of the lord and of the city  welcome  he held out his hand
and pippin took it 
‘i am named beregond son of baranor  i have no duty this morning  and i
have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words  and to tell you some of the
many things that no doubt you will wish to know  and for my part  i would learn
of you also  for never before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we
have heard rumour of them  little is said of them in any tale that we know 
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir  do you know him well ’
‘well ’ said pippin  ‘i have known of him all my short life  as
you might say  and lately i have travelled far with him  but there is much to
read in that book  and i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two  yet
perhaps i know him as well as any but a few  aragorn was the only one of our
company  i think  who really knew him ’
‘aragorn ’ said beregond  ‘who is he ’
‘oh ’ stammered pippin  ‘he was a man who went about with us  i think
he is in rohan now ’
‘you have been in rohan  i hear  there is much that i would ask you of that
land also  for we put much of what little hope we have in its people  but i am
forgetting my errand  which was first to answer what you would ask  what would
you know  master peregrin ’
‘er well ’ said pippin  ‘if i may venture to say so  rather a burning
question in my mind at present is  well  what about breakfast and all that  i
mean  what are the meal-times  if you understand me  and where is the
dining-room  if there is one  and the inns  i looked  but never a one could i
see as we rode up  though i had been borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as
soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men ’
beregond looked at him gravely  ‘an old campaigner  i see ’ he said 
‘they say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food
and of drink  though i am not a travelled man myself  then you have not yet
eaten today ’
‘well  yes  to speak in courtesy  yes ’ said pippin  ‘but no more than
a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord  but he
racked me for it with an hour of questions  and that is hungry work ’
beregond laughed  ‘at the table small men may do the greater deeds  we say 
but you have broken your fast as well as any man in the citadel  and with
greater honour  this is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of
war  we rise ere the sun  and take a morsel in the grey light  and go to our
duties at the opening hour  but do not despair ’ he laughed again  seeing the
dismay in pippin’s face  ‘those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to
refresh their strength in the mid-morning  then there is the nuncheon  at noon
or after as duties allow  and men gather for the daymeal  and such mirth as
there still may be  about the hour of sunset 
‘come  we will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment  and eat
and drink on the battlement  and survey the fair morning ’
‘one moment ’ said pippin blushing  ‘greed  or hunger by your courtesy 
put it out of my mind  but gandalf  mithrandir as you call him  asked me to see
to his horse - shadowfax  a great steed of rohan  and the apple of the king’s
eye  i am told  though he has given him to mithrandir for his services  i think
his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men  and if his good
will is of any value to this city  you will treat shadowfax with all honour 
with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit  if it is possible ’
‘hobbit ’ said beregond 
‘that is what we call ourselves ’ said pippin 
‘i am glad to learn it ’ said beregond  ‘for now i may say that strange
accents do not mar fair speech  and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk  but come 
you shall make me acquainted with this good horse  i love beasts  and we see
them seldom in this stony city  for my people came from the mountain-vales  and
before that from ithilien  but fear not  the visit shall be short  a mere call
of courtesy  and we will go thence to the butteries ’
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended  for in the sixth
circle  outside the walls of the citadel  there were some fair stables where a
few swift horses were kept  hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the
lord  messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of denethor or his
chief captains  but now all the horses and the riders were out and away 
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head  ‘good
morning ’ said pippin  ‘gandalf will come as soon as he may  he is busy  but
he sends greetings  and i am to see that all is well with you  and you resting 
i hope  after your long labours ’
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped  but he allowed beregond to handle his
head gently and stroke his great flanks 
‘he looks as if he were spoiling for a race  and not newly come from a
great journey ’ said beregond  ‘how strong and proud he is  where is his
harness  it should be rich and fair ’
‘none is rich and fair enough for him ’ said pippin  ‘he will have
none  if he will consent to bear you  bear you he does  and if not  well  no
bit  bridle  whip  or thong will tame him  farewell  shadowfax  have patience 
battle is coming ’
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed  so that the stable shook  and they
covered their ears  then they took their leave  seeing that the manger was well
filled 
‘and now for our manger ’ said beregond  and he led pippin back to the
citadel  and so to a door in the north side of the great tower  there they went
down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps  there were hatches in
the walls at the side  and one of these was open 
‘this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard ’ said
beregond  ‘greetings  targon ’ he called through the hatch  ‘it is early
yet  but here is a newcomer that the lord has taken into his service  he has
ridden long and far with a tight belt  and has had sore labour this morning  and
he is hungry  give us what you have ’
they got there bread  and butter  and cheese and apples  the last of the
winter store  wrinkled but sound and sweet  and a leather flagon of new-drawn
ale  and wooden platters and cups  they put all into a wicker basket and climbed
back into the sun  and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the
great out-thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill  from there they could look out on the morning over
the world 
they ate and drank  and they talked now of gondor and its ways and customs 
now of the shire and the strange countries that pippin had seen  and ever as
they talked beregond was more amazed  and looked with greater wonder at the
hobbit  swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat  or standing tiptoe upon
it to peer over the sill at the lands below 
‘i will not hide from you  master peregrin ’ said beregond  ‘that to us
you look almost as one of our children  a lad of nine summers or so  and yet you
have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could boast of 
i thought it was the whim of our lord to take him a noble page  after the manner
of the kings of old  they say  but i see that it is not so  and you must pardon
my foolishness ’
‘i do ’ said pippin  ‘though you are not far wrong  i am still little
more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people  and it will be four years yet
before i “come of age”  as we say in the shire  but do not bother about me 
come and look and tell me what i can see ’
the sun was now climbing  and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up 
the last of them were floating away  just overhead  as wisps of white cloud
borne on the stiffening breeze from the east  that was now flapping and tugging
the flags and white standards of the citadel  away down in the valley-bottom 
five leagues or so as the eye leaps  the great river could now be seen grey and
glittering  coming out of the north-west  and bending in a mighty sweep south
and west again  till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer  far beyond which
lay the sea fifty leagues away 
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out before him  dotted into the
distance with farmsteads and little walls  barns and byres  but nowhere could he
see any kine or other beasts  many roads and tracks crossed the green fields 
and there was much coming and going  wains moving in lines towards the great
gate  and others passing out  now and again a horseman would ride up  and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the city  but most of the traffic went out along
the chief highway  and that turned south  and then bending swifter than the
river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight  it was wide and well-paved 
and along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding-track  and beyond that a
wall  on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro  but all the street seemed to be
choked with great covered wains going south  but soon pippin saw that all was in
fact well-ordered  the wains were moving in three lines  one swifter drawn by
horses  another slower  great waggons with fair housings of many colours  drawn
by oxen  and along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by
trudging men 
‘that is the road to the vales of tumladen and lossarnach  and the
mountain-villages  and then on to lebennin ’ said beregond  ‘there go the
last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children  and the women
that must go with them  they must all be gone from the gate and the road clear
for a league before noon  that was the order  it is a sad necessity ’ he
sighed  ‘few  maybe  of those now sundered will meet again  and there were
always too few children in this city  but now there are none-save some young
lads that will not depart  and may find some task to do  my own son is one of
them ’
they fell silent for a while  pippin gazed anxiously eastward  as if at any
moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields  ‘what can i see
there ’ he asked  pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the
anduin  ‘is that another city  or what is it ’
‘it was a city ’ said beregond  ‘the chief city of gondor  of which
this was only a fortress  for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of
anduin  which our enemies took and burned long ago  yet we won it back in the
days of the youth of denethor  not to dwell in  but to hold as an outpost  and
to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms  and then came the fell riders
out of minas morgul ’
‘the black riders ’ said pippin  opening his eyes  and they were wide and
dark with an old fear re-awakened 
‘yes  they were black ’ said beregond  ‘and i see that you know
something of them  though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales ’
‘i know of them ’ said pippin softly  ‘but i will not speak of them
now  so near  so near ’ he broke off and lifted his eyes above the river  and
it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow 
perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight  their jagged edges
softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air  perhaps it was but a
cloud-wall  and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom  but even as he looked it
seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering  very slowly  slowly
rising to smother the regions of the sun 
‘so near to mordor ’ said beregond quietly  ‘yes  there it lies  we
seldom name it  but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow  sometimes it
seems fainter and more distant  sometimes nearer and darker  it is growing and
darkening now  and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too  and the fell
riders  less than a year ago they won back the crossings  and many of our best
men were slain  boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back from this
western shore  and we hold still the near half of osgiliath  for a little while 
but we await now a new onslaught there  maybe the chief onslaught of the war
that comes ’
‘when ’ said pippin  ‘have you a guess  for i saw the beacons last
night and the errand-riders  and gandalf said that it was a sign that war had
begun  he seemed in a desperate hurry  but now everything seems to have slowed
up again ’
‘only because everything is now ready ’ said beregond  ‘it is but the
deep breath before the plunge ’
‘but why were the beacons lit last night ’
‘it is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged ’ answered
beregond  ‘but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains  they
have many ways of gathering news  and the lord denethor is unlike other men  he
sees far  some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the tower at
night  and bends his thought this way and that  he can read somewhat of the
future  and that he will at times search even the mind of the enemy  wrestling
with him  and so it is that he is old  worn before his time  but however that
may be  my lord faramir is abroad  beyond the river on some perilous errand  and
he may have sent tidings 
‘but if you would know what i think set the beacons ablaze  it was the news
that came yestereve out of lebennin  there is a great fleet drawing near to the
mouths of anduin  manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south  they have long
ceased to fear the might of gondor  and they have allied them with the enemy 
and now make a heavy stroke in his cause  for this attack will draw off much of
the help that we looked to have from lebennin and belfalas  where folk are hardy
and numerous  all the more do our thoughts go north to rohan  and the more glad
are we for these tidings of victory that you bring 
‘and yet’ - he paused and stood up  and looked round  north 
east  and south - ‘the doings at isengard should warn us that we are caught
now in a great net and strategy  this is no longer a bickering at the fords 
raiding from ithilien and from anórien  ambushing and pillaging  this is
a great war long-planned  and we are but one piece in it  whatever pride
may say  things move in the far east beyond the inland sea  it is reported  and
north in mirkwood and beyond  and south in harad  and now all realms shall be
put to the test  to stand  or fall - under the shadow 
‘yet  master peregrin  we have this honour  ever we bear the brunt of the
chief hatred of the dark lord  for that hatred comes down out of the depths of
time and over the deeps of the sea  here will the hammer-stroke fall hardest 
and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste  for if we fall  who
shall stand  and  master peregrin  do you see any hope that we shall stand ’
pippin did not answer  he looked at the great walls  and the towers and brave
banners  and the sun in the high sky  and then at the gathering gloom in the
east  and he thought of the long fingers of that shadow  of the orcs in the
woods and the mountains  the treason of isengard  the birds of evil eye  and the
black riders even in the lanes of the shire - and of the winged terror 
the nazgûl  he shuddered  and hope seemed to wither  and even at that
moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured  as though a dark wing had
passed across it  almost beyond hearing he thought he caught  high and far up in
the heavens  a cry  faint  but heart-quelling  cruel and cold  he
blanched and cowered against the wall 
‘what was that ’ asked beregond  ‘you also felt something ’
‘yes ’ muttered pippin  ‘it is the sign of our fall  and the shadow of
doom  a fell rider of the air ’
‘yes  the shadow of doom ’ said beregond  ‘i fear that minas tirith
shall fall  night comes  the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away ’
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak  then
suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the banners
still streaming in the breeze  he shook himself  ‘it is passed ’ he said 
‘no  my heart will not yet despair  gandalf fell and has returned and is with
us  we may stand  if only on one leg  or at least be left still upon our
knees ’
‘rightly said ’ cried beregond  rising and striding to and fro  ‘nay 
though all things must come utterly to an end in time  gondor shall not perish
yet  not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of
carrion before them  there are still other fastnesses  and secret ways of escape
into the mountains  hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where
the grass is green ’
‘all the same  i wish it was over for good or ill ’ said pippin  ‘i am
no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle  but waiting on the edge of
one that i can’t escape is worst of all  what a long day it seems already  i
should be happier  if we were not obliged to stand and watch  making no move 
striking nowhere first  no stroke would have been struck in rohan  i think  but
for gandalf ’
‘ah  there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel ’ said
beregond  ‘but things may change when faramir returns  he is bold  more bold
than many deem  for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be
wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song  as he is  and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field  but such is faramir  less reckless
and eager than boromir  but not less resolute  yet what indeed can he do  we
cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm  our reach is shortened  and
we cannot strike till some foe comes within it  then our hand must be heavy ’
he smote the hilt of his sword 
pippin looked at him  tall and proud and noble  as all the men that he had
yet seen in that land  and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the
battle  ‘alas  my own hand feels as light as a feather ’ he thought  but he
said nothing  ‘a pawn did gandalf say  perhaps but on the wrong chessboard ’
so they talked until the sun reached its height  and suddenly the noon-bells
were rung  and there was a stir in the citadel  for all save the watchmen were
going to their meal 
‘will you come with me ’ said beregond  ‘you may join my mess for this
day  i do not know to what company you will be assigned  or the lord may hold
you at his own command  but you will be welcome  and it will be well to meet as
many men as you may  while there is yet time ’
‘i shall be glad to come ’ said pippin  ‘i am lonely  to tell you the
truth  i left my best friend behind in rohan  and i have had no one to talk to
or jest with  perhaps i could really join your company  are you the captain  if
so  you could take me on  or speak for me ’
‘nay  nay ’ beregond laughed  ‘i am no captain  neither office nor rank
nor lordship have i  being but a plain man of arms of the third company of the
citadel  yet  master peregrin  to be only a man of arms of the guard of the
tower of gondor is held worthy in the city  and such men have honour in the
land ’
‘then it is far beyond me ’ said pippin  ‘take me back to our room  and
if gandalf is not there  i will go where you like - as your guest ’
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message  so pippin went with
beregond and was made known to the men of the third company  and it seemed that
beregond got as much honour from it as his guest  for pippin was very welcome 
there had already been much talk in the citadel about mithrandir’s companion
and his long closeting with the lord  and rumour declared that a prince of the
halflings had come out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five
thousand swords  and some said that when the riders came from rohan each would
bring behind him a halfling warrior  small maybe  but doughty 
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale  he could not be
rid of his new rank  only fitting  men thought  to one befriended by boromir and
honoured by the lord denethor  and they thanked him for coming among them  and
hung on his words and stories of the outlands  and gave him as much food and ale
as he could wish  indeed his only trouble was to be ‘wary’ according to the
counsel of gandalf  and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a
hobbit among friends 
at length beregond rose  ‘farewell for this time ’ he said  ‘i have
duty now till sundown  as have all the others here  i think  but if you are
lonely  as you say  maybe you would like a merry guide about the city  my son
would go with you gladly  a good lad  i may say  if that pleases you  go down to
the lowest circle and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath celerdain  the
lampwrights’ street  you will find him there with other lads that are
remaining in the city  there may be things worth seeing down at the great gate
ere the closing ’
he went out  and soon after all the others followed  the day was still fine 
though it was growing hazy  and it was hot for march  even so far southwards 
pippin felt sleepy  but the lodging seemed cheerless  and he decided to go down
and explore the city  he took a few morsels that he had saved to shadowfax  and
they were graciously accepted  though the horse seemed to have no lack  then he
walked on down many winding ways 
people stared much as he passed  to his face men were gravely courteous 
saluting him after the manner of gondor with bowed head and hands upon the
breast  but behind him he heard many calls  as those out of doors cried to
others within to come and see the prince of the halflings  the companion of
mithrandir  many used some other tongue than the common speech  but it was not
long before he learned at least what was meant by ernil i pheriannath and
knew that his title had gone down before him into the city 
he came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to the
lowest and widest circle  and there he was directed to the lampwrights’
street  a broad way running towards the great gate  in it he found the old
guesthouse  a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running back
from the street  and between them a narrow greensward  behind which was the
many-windowed house  fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch and a
flight of steps down on to the grass  boys were playing among the pillars  the
only children that pippin had seen in minas tirith  and he stopped to look at
them  presently one of them caught sight of him  and with a shout he sprang
across the grass and came into the street  followed by several others  there he
stood in front of pippin  looking him up and down 
‘greetings ’ said the lad  ‘where do you come from  you are a stranger
in the city ’
‘i was ’ said pippin  ‘but they say i have become a man of gondor ’
‘oh come ’ said the lad  ‘then we are all men here  but how old are
you  and what is your name  i am ten years already  and shall soon be five feet 
i am taller than you  but then my father is a guard  one of the tallest  what is
your father ’
‘which question shall i answer first ’ said pippin  ‘my father farms
the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire  i am nearly twenty-nine 
so i pass you there  though i am but four feet  and not likely to grow any more 
save sideways ’
‘twenty-nine ’ said the lad and whistled  ‘why  you are quite old  as
old as my uncle iorlas  still ’ he added hopefully  ‘i wager i could stand
you on your head or lay you on your back ’
‘maybe you could  if i let you ’ said pippin with a laugh  ‘and maybe i
could do the same to you  we know some wrestling tricks in my little country 
where  let me tell you  i am considered uncommonly large and strong  and i have
never allowed anyone to stand me on my head  so if it came to a trial and
nothing else would serve  i might have to kill you  for when you are older  you
will learn that folk are not always what they seem  and though you may have
taken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey  let me warn you  i am not  i am
a halfling  hard  bold  and wicked ’ pippin pulled such a grim face that the
boy stepped back a pace  but at once he returned with clenched fists and the
light of battle in his eye 
‘no ’ pippin laughed  ‘don’t believe what strangers say of themselves
either  i am not a fighter  but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say who he is ’
the boy drew himself up proudly  ‘i am bergil son of beregond of the
guards ’ he said 
‘so i thought ’ said pippin  ‘for you look like your father  i know him
and he sent me to find you ’
‘then why did you not say so at once ’ said bergil  and suddenly a look
of dismay came over his face  ‘do not tell me that he has changed his mind 
and will send me away with the maidens  but no  the last wains have gone ’
‘his message is less bad than that  if not good ’ said pippin  ‘he says
that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head  you might show me round
the city for a while and cheer my loneliness  i can tell you some tales of far
countries in return ’
bergil clapped his hands  and laughed with relief  ‘all is well ’ he
cried  ‘come then  we were soon going to the gate to look on  we will go
now ’
‘what is happening there ’
‘the captains of the outlands are expected up the south road ere sundown 
come with us and you will see ’
bergil proved a good comrade  the best company pippin had had since he parted
from merry  and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the
streets  heedless of the many glances that men gave them  before long they found
themselves in a throng going towards the great gate  there pippin went up much
in the esteem of bergil  for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard
saluted him and let him pass through  and what was more  he allowed him to take
his companion with him 
‘that is good ’ said bergil  ‘we boys are no longer allowed to pass the
gate without an elder  now we shall see better ’
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of
the great paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran  all eyes were
turned southwards  and soon a murmur rose  ‘there is dust away there  they are
coming ’
pippin and bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd  and
waited  horns sounded at some distance  and the noise of cheering rolled towards
them like a gathering wind  then there was a loud trumpet-blast  and all about
them people were shouting 
‘forlong  forlong ’ pippin heard men calling  ‘what do they say ’ he
asked 
‘forlong has come ’ bergil answered  ‘old forlong the fat  the lord of
lossarnach  that is where my grandsire lives  hurrah  here he is  good old
forlong ’
leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse  and on it sat a
man of wide shoulders and huge girth  but old and grey-bearded  yet mail-clad
and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear  behind him marched proudly a
dusty line of men  well-armed and bearing great battle-axes  grim-faced they
were  and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen
in gondor 
‘forlong ’ men shouted  ‘true heart  true friend  forlong ’ but when
the men of lossarnach had passed they muttered  ‘so few  two hundreds  what
are they  we hoped for ten times the number  that will be the new tidings of the
black fleet  they are sparing only a tithe of their strength  still every little
is a gain ’
and so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the
gate  men of the outlands marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark hour 
but always too few  always less than hope looked
for or need asked  the men of ringló vale behind the son of their lord 
dervorin striding on foot  three hundreds  from the uplands of morthond  the
great blackroot vale  tall duinhir with his sons  duilin and derufin  and
five hundred bowmen  from the anfalas  the langstrand far away  a long line of
men of many sorts  hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages  scantily
equipped save for the household of golasgil their lord  from lamedon  a few grim
hillmen without a captain  fisher-folk of the ethir  some hundred or more spared
from the ships  hirluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath gelin with
three hundreds of gallant green-clad men  and last and proudest  imrahil  prince
of dol amroth  kinsman of the lord  with gilded banners bearing his token of the
ship and the silver swan  and a company of knights in full harness riding grey
horses  and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms  tall as lords  grey-eyed 
dark-haired  singing as they came 
and that was all  less than three thousands full told  no more would come 
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the city and died away  the
onlookers stood silent for a while  dust hung in the air  for the wind had died
and the evening was heavy  already the closing hour was drawing nigh  and the
red sun had gone behind mindolluin  shadow came down on the city 
pippin looked up  and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey  as
if a vast dust and smoke hung above them  and light came dully through it  but
in the west the dying sun had set all the fume on fire  and now mindolluin stood
black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers  ‘so ends a fair day in
wrath ’ he said forgetful of the lad at his side 
‘so it will  if i have not returned before the sundown-bells ’ said
bergil  ‘come  there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate ’
hand in hand they went back into the city  the last to pass the gate before
it was shut  and as they reached the lampwrights’ street all the bells in the
towers tolled solemnly  lights sprang in many windows  and from the houses and
wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of song 
‘farewell for this time ’ said bergil  ‘take my greetings to my
 father  and thank him for the company that he sent  come again soon  i beg 
almost i wish now that there was no war  for we might have had some merry times 
we might have journeyed to lossarnach  to my grandsire’s house  it is good to
be there in spring  the woods and fields are full of flowers  but maybe we will
go thither together yet  they will never overcome our lord  and my father is
very valiant  farewell and return ’
they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel  it seemed a long
way  and he grew hot and very hungry  and night closed down swift and dark  not
a star pricked the sky  he was late for the daymeal in the mess  and beregond
greeted him gladly  and sat him at his side to hear news of his son  after the
meal pippin stayed a while  and then took his leave  for a strange gloom was on
him  and now he desired very much to see gandalf again 
‘can you find your way ’ said beregond at the door of the small hall  on
the north side of the citadel  where they had sat  ‘it is a black night  and
all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the city 
and none are to shine out from the walls  and i can give you news of another
order  you will be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow  i fear you will
not be for the third company  still we may hope to meet again  farewell and
sleep in peace ’
the lodging was dark  save for a little lantern set on the table  gandalf was
not there  gloom settled still more heavily on pippin  he climbed on the bench
and tried to peer out of a window  but it was like looking into a pool of ink 
he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed  for a while he lay and
listened for sounds of gandalf’s return  and then he fell into an uneasy
sleep 
in the night he was wakened by a light  and he saw that gandalf had come and
was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove  there were
candles on the table and rolls of parchment  he heard the wizard sigh  and
mutter  ‘when will faramir return ’
‘hullo ’ said pippin  poking his head round the curtain  ‘i thought you
had forgotten all about me  i am glad to see you back  it has been a long
day ’
‘but the night will be too short ’ said gandalf  ‘i have come back
here  for i must have a little peace  alone  you should sleep  in a bed while
you still may  at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again  no 
when the summons comes  not at sunrise  the darkness has begun  there will be no
dawn ’
 
gandalf was gone  and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night 
when merry came back to aragorn  he had only a light bundle  for he had lost his
pack at parth galen  and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up
among the wreckage of isengard  hasufel was already saddled  legolas and gimli
with their horse stood close by 
‘so four of the company still remain ’ said aragorn  ‘we will ride on
together  but we shall not go alone  as i thought  the king is now determined to
set out at once  since the coming of the winged shadow  he desires to return to
the hills under cover of night ’
‘and then whither ’ said legolas 
‘i cannot say yet ’ aragorn answered  ‘as for the king  he will go to
the muster that he commanded at edoras  four nights from now  and there  i
think  he will hear tidings of war  and the riders of rohan will go down to
minas tirith  but for myself  and any that will go with me      ’
‘i for one ’ cried legolas  ‘and gimli with him ’ said the dwarf 
‘well  for myself ’ said aragorn  ‘it is dark before me  i must go down
also to minas tirith  but i do not yet see the road  an hour long prepared
approaches ’
‘don’t leave me behind ’ said merry  ‘i have not been of much use
yet  but i don’t want to be laid aside  like baggage to be called for when all
is over  i don’t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now 
though  of course  the king did say that i was to sit by him when he came to his
house and tell him all about the shire ’
‘yes ’ said aragorn  ‘and your road lies with him  i think  merry  but
do not look for mirth at the ending  it will be long 
i fear  ere théoden sits at ease again in meduseld  many hopes will
wither in this bitter spring ’
soon all were ready to depart  twenty-four horses  with gimli behind legolas 
and merry in front of aragorn  presently they were riding swiftly through the
night  they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen  when a rider
galloped up from the rear of their line 
‘my lord ’ he said to the king  ‘there are horsemen behind us  as we
crossed the fords i thought that i heard them  now we are sure  they are
overtaking us  riding hard ’
théoden at once called a halt  the riders turned about and seized
their spears  aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground  and drawing his
sword he stood by the king’s stirrup  éomer and his esquire rode back
to the rear  merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever  and he
wondered  if there was a fight  what he should do  supposing the king’s small
escort was trapped and overcome  but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the
wild fields of rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles 
‘no good ’ he thought  he drew his sword and tightened his belt 
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud  but suddenly it rode
out clear again  then they all heard the sound of hoofs  and at the same moment
they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords  the moonlight
glinted here and there on the points of spears  the number of the pursuers could
not be told  but they seemed no fewer than the king’s escort  at the least 
when they were some fifty paces off  éomer
cried in a loud voice  ‘halt  halt  who rides in rohan ’
the pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand  a silence followed  and
then in the moonlight  a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slowly
forward  his hand showed white as he held it up  palm outward  in token of
peace  but the king’s men gripped their weapons  at ten paces the man stopped 
he was tall  a dark standing shadow  then his clear voice rang out 
‘rohan  rohan did you say  that is a glad word  we seek that land in haste
from long afar ’
‘you have found it ’ said éomer  ‘when you crossed the fords
yonder you entered it  but it is the realm of théoden the king  none ride
here save by his leave  who are you  and what is your haste ’
‘halbarad dúnadan  ranger of the north
i am ’ cried the man  ‘we seek one aragorn son of arathorn  and we heard
that he was in rohan ’
‘and you have found him also ’ cried aragorn  giving his reins to merry 
he ran forward and embraced the newcomer  ‘halbarad ’ he said  ‘of all
joys this is the least expected ’
merry breathed a sigh of relief  he had thought that this was some last trick
of saruman’s  to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him  but it
seemed that there would be no need to die in théoden’s defence 
not yet at any rate  he sheathed his sword 
‘all is well ’ said aragorn  turning back  ‘here are some of my own kin
from the far land where i dwelt  but why they come  and how many they be 
halbarad shall tell us ’
‘i have thirty with me ’ said halbarad  ‘that is all of our kindred
that could be gathered in haste  but the brethren elladan and elrohir have
ridden with us  desiring to go to the war  we rode as swiftly as we might when
your summons came ’
‘but i did not summon you ’ said aragorn  ‘save only in wish  my
thoughts have often turned to you  and seldom more than tonight  yet i have sent
no word  but come  all such matters must wait  you find us riding in haste and
danger  ride with us now  if the king will give his leave ’
théoden was indeed glad of the news  ‘it is well ’ he said 
‘if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself  my lord aragorn  thirty such
knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads ’
then the riders set out again  and aragorn for a while rode with the dúnedain 
and when they had spoken of tidings in the north and in the south  elrohir said
to him 
‘i bring word to you from my father  the days are short  if thou art in
haste  remember the paths of the dead ’
‘always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire ’
answered aragorn  ‘but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road ’
‘that will soon be seen ’ said elrohir  ‘but let us speak no more of
these things upon the open road ’
and aragorn said to halbarad  ‘what is that that you bear  kinsman ’ for
he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff  as it were a standard  but
it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs 
‘it is a gift that i bring you from the lady of rivendell ’ answered
halbarad  ‘she wrought it in secret  and long was the making  but she also
sends word to you  the days now are short  either our hope cometh  or all
hopes end  therefore i send thee what i have made for thee  fare well  elfstone ’
and aragorn said  ‘now i know what you bear  bear it still for me a
while ’ and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars  and
then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night’s journey lasted 
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from
deeping-coomb and came back to the hornburg  there they were to lie and rest for
a brief while and take counsel 
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli  ‘the sun is high ’
said legolas  ‘all others are up and doing  come  master sluggard  and look at
this place while you may ’
‘there was a battle here three nights ago ’ said gimli  ‘and here
legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc  come and see how it
was  and there are caves  merry  caves of wonder  shall we visit them  legolas 
do you think ’
‘nay  there is no time ’ said the elf  ‘do not spoil the wonder with
haste  i have given you my word to return hither with you  if a day of peace and
freedom comes again  but it is now near to noon  and at that hour we eat  and
then set out again  i hear ’
merry got up and yawned  his few hours’ sleep had not been nearly enough 
he was tired and rather dismal  he missed pippin  and felt that he was only a
burden  while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not
fully understand  ‘where is aragorn ’ he asked 
‘in a high chamber of the burg ’ said legolas  ‘he has neither rested
nor slept  i think  he went thither some hours ago  saying that he must take
thought  and only his kinsman  halbarad  went with him  but some dark doubt or
care sits on him ’
‘they are a strange company  these newcomers ’ said gimli  ‘stout men
and lordly they are  and the riders of rohan look almost as boys beside them 
for they are grim men of face  worn like weathered rocks for the most part  even
as aragorn himself  and they are silent ’
‘but even as aragorn they are courteous  if they break their silence ’
said legolas  ‘and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir  less
sombre is their gear than the others’  and they are fair and gallant as
elven-lords  and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of elrond of
rivendell ’
‘why have they come  have you heard ’ asked merry  he had now dressed 
and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders  and the three passed out
together towards the ruined gate of the burg 
‘they answered a summons  as you heard ’ said gimli  ‘word came to
rivendell  they say  aragorn has need of his
kindred  let the dúnedain ride to him in rohan  but whence
this message came they are now in doubt  gandalf sent it  i would guess ’
‘nay  galadriel ’ said legolas  ‘did she not speak through gandalf of
the ride of the grey company from the north ’
‘yes  you have it ’ said gimli  ‘the lady of the wood  she read many
hearts and desires  now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk 
legolas ’
legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and east 
and his fair face was troubled  ‘i do not think that any would come ’ he
answered  ‘they have no need to ride to war  war already marches on their own
lands ’
for a while the three companions walked together  speaking of this and that
turn of the battle  and they went down from the broken gate  and passed the
mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road  until they stood on
helm’s dike and looked into the coomb  the death down already stood there 
black and tall and stony  and the great trampling and scoring of the grass by
the huorns could be plainly seen  the dunlendings and many men of the garrison
of the burg were at work on the dike or in the fields and about the battered
walls behind  yet all seemed strangely quiet  a weary valley resting after a
great storm  soon they turned back and went to the midday meal in the hall of
the burg 
the king was already there  and as soon as they entered he called for merry
and had a seat set for him at his side  ‘it is not as i would have it ’ said
théoden  ‘for this is little like my fair house in edoras  and your
friend is gone  who should also be here  but it may be long ere we sit  you and
i  at the high table in meduseld  there will be no time for feasting when
i return thither  but come now  eat and drink  and let us speak together while
we may  and then you shall ride with me ’
‘may i ’ said merry  surprised and delighted  ‘that would be
splendid ’ he had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words  ‘i am
afraid i am only in everybody’s way ’ he stammered  ‘but i should like to
do anything i could  you know ’
‘i doubt it not ’ said the king  ‘i have had a good hill-pony made
ready for you  he will bear you as swift as any
horse by the roads that we shall take  for i will ride from the burg by mountain
paths  not by the plain  and so come to edoras by way of dunharrow where the
lady éowyn awaits me  you shall be my esquire  if you will  is there gear
of war in this place  éomer  that my sword-thain could use ’
‘there are no great weapon-hoards here  lord ’ answered éomer 
‘maybe a light helm might be found to fit him  but we have no mail or sword
for one of his stature ’
‘i have a sword ’ said merry  climbing from
his seat  and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade  filled
suddenly with love for this old man  he knelt on one knee  and took his hand and
kissed it  ‘may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire on your lap théoden
king ’ he cried  ‘receive my service  if you will ’
‘gladly will i take it ’ said the king  and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hobbit  he blessed him  ‘rise now  meriadoc 
esquire of rohan of the household of meduseld ’ he said  ‘take your sword
and bear it unto good fortune ’
‘as a father you shall be to me ’ said merry 
‘for a little while ’ said théoden 
they talked then together as they ate  until presently éomer spoke 
‘it is near the hour that we set for our going  lord ’ he said  ‘shall i
bid men sound the horns  but where is aragorn  his place is empty and he
has not eaten ’
‘we will make ready to ride ’ said théoden  ‘but let word be
sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh ’
the king with his guard and merry at his side passed down from the gate of
the burg to where the riders were assembling on the green  many were already
mounted  it would be a great company  for the king was leaving only a small
garrison in the burg  and all who could be spared were riding to the weapontake
at edoras  a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night  but still
there would be some five hundred more to go with the king  for the most part men
from the fields and dales of westfold 
a little apart the rangers sat  silent  in an ordered company  armed with
spear and bow and sword  they were clad in cloaks of dark grey  and their hoods
were cast now over helm and head  their horses were strong and of proud bearing 
but rough-haired  and one stood there without a rider  aragorn’s own horse
that they had brought from the north  roheryn was his name  there was no gleam
of stone or gold  nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness  nor did
their riders bear any badge or token  save only that each cloak was pinned upon
the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star 
the king mounted his horse  snowmane  and merry sat beside him on his pony 
stybba was his name  presently éomer came out from the gate  and with him
was aragorn  and halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black  and two
tall men  neither young nor old so much alike were they  the sons of elrond 
that few could tell them apart  dark-haired  grey-eyed  and their faces
elven-fair  clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey  behind them
walked legolas and gimli  but merry had eyes only for aragorn  so startling was
the change that he saw in him  as if in one night many years had fallen on his
head  grim was his face  grey-hued and weary 
‘i am troubled in mind  lord ’ he said  standing by the king’s horse 
‘i have heard strange words  and i see new perils
far off  i have laboured long in thought  and now i fear that i must change my
purpose  tell me  théoden  you ride now to dunharrow  how long will it be
ere you come there ’
‘it is now a full hour past noon ’ said
éomer  ‘before the night of the third day from now we should come to
the hold  the moon will then be one night past his full  and the muster that the
king commanded will be held the day after  more speed we cannot make  if the
strength of rohan is to be gathered ’
aragorn was silent for a moment  ‘three days ’ he murmured  ‘and the
muster of rohan will only be begun  but i see that it cannot now be hastened ’
he looked up  and it seemed that he had made some decision  his face was less
troubled  then  by our leave  lord  i must take new counsel for myself and my
kindred  we must ride our own road  and no longer in secret  for me the time of
stealth has passed  i will ride east by the swiftest way  and i will take the
paths of the dead ’
‘the paths of the dead ’ said théoden 
and trembled  ‘why do you speak of them ’ éomer turned and gazed at
aragorn  and it seemed to merry that the faces of the riders that sat within
hearing turned pale at the words  ‘if there be in truth such paths ’ said théoden 
‘their gate is in dunharrow  but no living man may pass it ’
‘alas  aragorn my friend ’ said éomer  ‘i had hoped that we
should ride to war together  but if you seek the paths of the dead  then our
parting is come  and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again
under the sun ’
‘that road i will take  nonetheless ’ said aragorn  ‘but i say to you 
éomer  that in battle we may yet meet again  though all the hosts of
mordor should stand between ’
‘you will do as you will  my lord aragorn ’ said théoden  ‘it is
your doom  maybe  to tread strange paths that others dare not  this parting
grieves me  and my strength is lessened by it  but now i must take the
mountain-roads and delay no longer  farewell ’
‘farewell  lord ’ said aragorn  ‘ride unto great renown  farewell 
merry  i leave you in good hands  better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs
to fangorn  legolas and gimli will still hunt with me  i hope  but we shall not
forget you ’
‘good-bye ’ said merry  he could find no more to say  he felt very small 
and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words  more than ever he
missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin  the riders were ready  and their
horses were fidgeting  he wished they would start arid get it over 
now théoden spoke to éomer  and he lifted up his hand
and cried aloud  and with that word the riders set forth  they rode over the
dike and down the coomb  and then  turning swiftly eastwards  they took a path
that skirted the foothills for a mile or so  until bending south it passed back
among the hills and disappeared from view  aragorn rode to the dike and watched
till the king’s men were far down the coomb  then he turned to halbarad 
‘there go three that i love  and the smallest not the least ’ he said 
‘he knows not to what end he rides  yet if he knew  he still would go on ’
‘a little people  but of great worth are the shire-folk ’ said halbarad 
‘little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders 
and yet i grudge it not ’
‘and now our fates are woven together ’ said aragorn  ‘and yet  alas 
here we must part  well  i must eat a little  and then we also must hasten away 
come  legolas and gimli  i must speak with you as i eat ’
together they went back into the burg  yet for some time aragorn sat silent
at the table in the hall  and the others waited for him to speak  ‘come ’
said legolas at last  ‘speak and be comforted  and shake off the shadow  what
has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey morning ’
‘a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the
hornburg ’ answered aragorn  ‘i have looked in the stone of orthanc  my
friends ’
‘you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry ’ exclaimed gimli
with fear and astonishment in his face  ‘did you say aught to - him  even
gandalf feared that encounter ’
‘you forget to whom you speak ’ said aragorn sternly  and his eyes
glinted  ‘did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors of edoras  what
do you fear that i should say to him  nay  gimli ’ he said in a softer voice 
and the grimness left his face  and he looked like one who has laboured in
sleepless pain for many nights  ‘nay  my friends  i and the lawful master of
the stone  and i had both the right and the strength to use it  or so i judged 
the right cannot be doubted  the strength was enough - barely ’
he drew a deep breath  ‘it was a bitter struggle  and the weariness is slow
to pass  i spoke no word to him  and in the end i wrenched the stone to my own
will  that alone he will find hard to endure  and he beheld me  yes  master
gimli  he saw me  but in other guise than you see me here  if that will aid him 
then i have done ill  but i do not think so  to know that i lived and walked the
earth was a blow to his heart  i deem  for he knew it not till now  the eyes in
orthanc did not see through the armour of théoden 
but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil  now in the very
hour of his great designs the heir of isildur and the sword are revealed  for l
showed the blade re-forged to him  he is not so mighty yet that he is
above fear  nay  doubt ever gnaws him ’
‘but he wields great dominion  nonetheless ’ said gimli  ‘and now he
will strike more swiftly ’
‘the hasty stroke goes oft astray ’ said aragorn  ‘we must press our
enemy  and no longer wait upon him for the move  see my friends  when i had
mastered the stone  i learned many things  a grave peril i saw coming
unlooked-for upon gondor from the south that will draw off great strength from
the defence of minas tirith  if it is not countered swiftly  i deem that the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone ’
‘then lost it must be ’ said gimli  ‘for what help is there to send
thither  and how could it come there in time ’
‘i have no help to send  therefore i must go myself ’ said aragorn 
‘but there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the
coastlands before all is lost  that is the paths of the dead ’
‘the paths of the dead ’ said gimli  ‘it is a fell name  and little to
the liking to the men of rohan  as i saw  can the living use such a road and not
perish  and even if you pass that way  what will so few avail to counter the
strokes of mordor ’
‘the living have never used that road since the coming of the rohirrim ’
said aragorn  ‘for it is closed to them  but in this dark hour the heir of
isildur may use it  if he dare  listen  this is the word that the sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in rivendell  wisest in lore  bid aragorn
remember the words of the seer  and the paths of the dead ’
‘and what may be the words of the seer ’ said legolas 
“thus spoke malbeth the seer  in the days of arvedui  last king at
fornost ’ said aragorn 
over the land there lies a long shadow 

westward reaching wings of darkness 

the tower trembles  to the tombs of kings

doom approaches  the dead awaken 

for the hour is come for the oathbreakers 

at the stone of erech they shall stand again

and hear there a horn in the hills ringing 

whose shall the horn be  who shall call them

from the prey twilight  the forgotten people 

the heir of him to whom the oath they swore 

from the north shall he come  need shall drive him 

he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead 
‘dark ways doubtless  said gimli  but no darker than these staves are to
me ’
‘if you would understand them better  then i bid you come with me ’ said
aragorn  ‘for that way i now shall take  but i do not go gladly  only need
drives me  therefore  only of your free will would i have you come  for you will
find both toil and great fear  and maybe worse ’
‘i will go with you even on the paths of the dead  and to whatever  end
they may lead ’ said gimli 
‘i also will come ’ said legolas  ‘for i do not fear the dead ’
‘i hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight ’
said gimli  ‘for otherwise i see not why we should trouble them ’
‘that we shall know if ever we come to erech ’ said aragorn  ‘but the
oath that they broke was to fight against sauron  and they must fight therefore 
if they are to fulfil it  for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was
brought  it was said  from númenor by
isildur  and it was set upon a hill  and upon it the king of the mountains swore
allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of gondor  but when sauron
returned and grew in might again  isildur summoned the men of the mountains
to fulfil their oath  and they would not  for they had worshipped sauron in the
dark years 
‘then isildur said to their king  “thou shalt be the last king  and if
the west prove mightier than thy black master  this curse i lay upon thee and
thy folk  to rest never until your oath is fulfilled  for this war will last
through years uncounted  and you shall be summoned once again ere the end ”
and they fled before the wrath of isildur  and did not dare to go forth to war
on sauron’s part  and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains
and had no dealings with other men  but slowly dwindled in the barren hills  and
the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the hill of erech and all places
where that people lingered  but that way i must go  since there are none living
to help me ’
he stood up  ‘come ’ he cried  and drew his sword  and it flashed in the
twilit hall of the burg  ‘to the stone of erech  i seek the paths of the dead 
come with me who will ’
legolas and gimli made no answer  but they rose and followed aragorn from the
hall  on the green there waited  still and silent  the hooded rangers  legolas
and gimli mounted  aragorn sprang upon roheryn  then halbarad lifted a great
horn  and the blast of it echoed in helm’s deep  and with that they leapt
away  riding down the coomb like thunder  while all the men that were left on
dike or burg stared in amaze 
and while théoden went by slow paths in the hills  the grey company
passed swiftly over the plain  and on the next day in the afternoon they came
to edoras  and there they halted only briefly  ere they passed up the valley 
and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell 
the lady éowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming  for no
mightier men had she seen than the dúnedain and the fair sons of elrond 
but on aragorn most of all her eyes rested  and when they sat at supper with
her  they talked together  and she heard of all that had passed since théoden
rode away  concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her  and when she
heard of the battle in helm’s deep and the great slaughter of their foes  and
of the charge of théoden and his knights  then her eyes shone 
but at last she said  ‘lords  you are weary and shall now go to your beds
with such ease as can be contrived in haste  but tomorrow fairer housing shall
be found for you ’
but aragorn said  ‘nay  lady  be not troubled for us  if we may lie here
tonight and break our fast tomorrow  it will be enough  for i ride on an errand
most urgent  and with the first light of morning we must go ’
she smiled on him and said  ‘then it was kindly done  lord  to ride so many
miles out of your way to bring tidings to éowyn  and to speak with her in
her exile ’
‘indeed no man would count such a journey wasted ’ said aragorn  ‘and
yet  lady  i could not have come hither  if it were not that the road which i
must take leads me to dunharrow ’
and she answered as one that likes not what is said  “then  lord  you are
astray  for out of harrowdale no road runs east or south  and you had best
return as you came ’
‘nay  lady ’ said he  ‘i am not astray  for i walked in this land ere
you were born to grace it  there is a road out of this valley  and that road i
shall take  tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead ’
then she stared at him as one that is stricken  and her face blanched  and
for long she spoke no more  while all sat silent  ‘but  aragorn ’ she said
at last  ‘is it then your errand to seek death  for that is all that you will
find on that road  they do not suffer the living to pass ’
‘they may suffer me to pass ’ said aragorn  ‘but at the least i will
adventure it  no other road will serve ’
‘but this is madness ’ she said  ‘for here are men of renown and
prowess  whom you should not take into the shadows  but should lead to war 
where men are needed  i beg you to remain and ride with my brother  for then all
our hearts will be gladdened  and our hope be the brighter ’
‘it is not madness  lady ’ he answered  ‘for i go on a path appointed 
but those who follow me do so of their free will  and if they wish now to remain
and ride with the rohirrim  they may do so  but i shall take the paths of the
dead  alone  if needs be ’
then they said no more  and they ate in silence  but her eyes were ever upon
aragorn  and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind  at length
they arose  and took their leave of the lady  and thanked her for her care  and
went to their rest 
but as aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and
gimli  and his companions had gone in  there came the lady éowyn
after him and called to him  he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night 
for she was clad in white  but her eyes were on fire 
‘aragorn ’ she said  ‘why will you go on this deadly road ’
‘because i must ’ he said  ‘only so can i see any hope of doing
my part in the war against sauron  i do not choose paths of peril  éowyn 
were i to go where my heart dwells  far in the north i would now be wandering in
the fair valley of rivendell ’
for a while she was silent  as if pondering what this might mean  then
suddenly she laid her hand on his arm  ‘you are a stern lord and resolute ’
she said  ‘and thus do men win renown ’ she paused  ‘lord ’ she said 
‘if you must go  then let me ride in your following  for i am weary of
skulking in the hills  and wish to face peril and battle ’
‘your duty is with your people ’ he answered 
‘too often have i heard of duty ’ she cried  ‘but am i not of the house
of eorl  a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse  i have waited on faltering feet
long enough  since they falter no longer  it seems  may i not now spend my life
as i will ’
‘few may do that with honour ’ he answered  ‘but as for you  lady  did
you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord’s return  if
you had not been chosen  then some marshal or captain would have been set in the
same place  and he could not ride away from his charge  were he weary of it or
no ’
‘shall i always be chosen ’ she said bitterly  ‘shall i always be left
behind when the riders depart  to mind the house while they win renown  and find
food and beds when they return ’
‘a time may come soon ’ said he  ‘when none will return  then there
will be need of valour without renown  for none shall remember the deeds that
are done in the last defence of your homes  yet the deeds will not be less
valiant because they are unpraised ’
and she answered  ‘all your words are but to say  you are a woman  and your
part is in the house  but when the men have died in battle and honour  you have
leave to be burned in the house  for the men will need it no more  but i am of
the house of eorl and not a serving-woman  i can ride and wield blade  and i do
not fear either pain or death ’
‘what do you fear  lady ’ he asked 
‘a cage ’ she said  ‘to stay behind bars  until use and old age accept
them  and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire ’
‘and yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that i had chosen 
because it is perilous ’
‘so may one counsel another ’ she said  ‘yet i do not bid you flee from
peril  but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory  i
would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly ’
‘nor would i ’ he said  ‘therefore i say to you  lady  stay  for you
have no errand to the south ’
‘neither have those others who go with thee  they go only because they
would not be parted from thee - because they love thee ’ then she turned and
vanished into the night 
when the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risen
above the high ridges in the east  aragorn made
ready to depart  his company was all mounted  and he was about to leap into the
saddle  when the lady éowyn came to bid them farewell  she was clad as a
rider and girt with a sword  in her hand she bore a cup  and she set it to her
lips and drank a little  wishing them good speed  and then she gave the
cup to aragorn  and he drank  and he said  ‘farewell  lady of rohan  i drink
to the fortunes of your house  and of you  and of all your people  say to your
brother  beyond the shadows we may meet again ’
then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were nearby that she wept  and in one
so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous  but she said  ‘aragorn  wilt
thou go ’
‘i will ’ he said 
‘then wilt thou not let me ride with this company  as i have asked ’
‘i will not  lady ’ he said  ‘for that i could not grant without leave
of the king and of your brother  and they will not return until tomorrow  but i
count now every hour  indeed every minute  farewell ’
then she fell on her knees  saying  ‘i beg thee ’
‘nay  lady ’ he said  and taking her by the hand he raised her  then he
kissed her hand  and sprang into the saddle  and rode away  and did not look
back  and only those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain that he
bore 
but éowyn stood still as a figure carven in stone  her hands
clenched at her sides  and she watched them until they passed into the shadows
under the black dwimorberg  the haunted mountain  in which was the gate of the
dead  when they were lost to view  she turned  stumbling as one that is blind 
and went back to her lodging  but none of her folk saw this parting  for they
hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until the day was up  and the
reckless strangers were gone 
and some said  ‘they are elvish wights  let them go where they belong  into
the dark places  and never return  the times are evil enough ’
the light was still grey as they rode  for the sun had not yet climbed over
the black ridges of the haunted mountain before them  a dread fell on them  even
as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimholt 
there under the gloom of black trees that not even legolas could long endure
they found a hollow place opening at the mountain’s root  and right in their
path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom 
‘my blood runs chill ’ said gimli  but the others were silent  and his
voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet  the horses would not pass
the threatening stone  until the riders dismounted and led them about  and so
they came at last deep into the glen  and there stood a sheer wall of rock  and
in the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night  signs and
figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read  and fear flowed from it
like a grey vapour 
the company halted  and there was not a heart among them that did not quail 
unless it were the heart of legolas of the elves  for whom the ghosts of men
have no terror 
‘this is an evil door ’ said halbarad  ‘and my death lies beyond it  i
will dare to pass it nonetheless  but no horse will enter ’
‘but we must go in  and therefore the horses must go too ’ said aragorn 
‘for if ever we come through this darkness  many leagues lie beyond  and every
hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer  follow me ’
then aragorn led the way  and such was the strength of his will in that hour
that all the dúnedain and their horses followed him  and indeed the love
that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were
willing to face even the terror of the door  if their masters’ hearts
were steady as they walked beside them  but arod  the horse of rohan  refused
the way  and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see 
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went soft in
the gloom  until he suffered himself to be led  and legolas passed in  and there
stood gimli the dwarf left all alone 
his knees shook  and he was wroth with himself  ‘here is a thing unheard
of ’ he said  ‘an elf will go underground and a
dwarf dare not ’ with that he plunged in  but it seemed to him that he dragged
his feet like lead over the threshold  and at once a blindness came upon him 
even upon gimli glóin’s son who had walked unafraid in many deep places
of the world 
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow  and now he went ahead bearing one
aloft  and elladan with another went at the rear  and gimli  stumbling behind 
strove to overtake him  he could see nothing but the dim flame of the torches 
but if the company halted  there seemed an endless whisper of voices all about
him  a murmur of words in no tongue that he had ever heard before 
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage  and yet steadily
fear grew on the dwarf as he went on  most of all because he knew now that there
could be no turning back  all the paths behind were thronged by an unseen host
that followed in the dark 
so time unreckoned passed  until gimli saw a sight that he was ever
afterwards loth to recall  the road was wide  as far as he could judge  but now
the company came suddenly into a great empty space  and there were no longer any
walls upon either side  the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk 
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorn’s torch drew
near  then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be 
‘does he feel no fear ’ muttered the dwarf  ‘in any other cave gimli glóin’s
son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold  but not here  let it
lie ’
nonetheless he drew near  and saw aragorn kneeling  while elladan held aloft
both torches  before him were the bones of a mighty man  he had been clad in
mail  and still his harness lay there whole  for the cavern’s air was as dry
as dust  and his hauberk was gilded  his belt was of gold and garnets  and rich
with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor  he had
fallen near the far wall of the cave  as now could be seen  and before him stood
a stony door closed fast  his finger-bones were still clawing at the cracks  a
notched and broken sword lay by him  as if he had hewn at the rock in his last
despair 
aragorn did not touch him  but after gazing silently for a while he rose and
sighed  ‘hither shall the flowers of simbelmynë
come never unto world’s end ’ he murmured  ‘nine mounds and seven there
are now green with grass  and through all the long years he has lain at the door
that he could not unlock  whither does it lead  why would he pass  none shall
ever know 
‘for that is not my errand ’ he cried  turning back and speaking to the
whispering darkness behind  ‘keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the
accursed years  speed only we ask  let us pass  and then come  i summon you to
the stone of erech ’
there was no answer  unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than the
whispers before  and then a chill blast came in which the torches flickered and
went out  and could not be rekindled  of the time that followed  one hour or
many  gimli remembered little  the others pressed on  but he was ever hindmost 
pursued by a groping horror that seemed always just about to seize him  and a
rumour came after him like the shadow-sound of many feet  he stumbled on until
he was crawling like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endure no
more  he must either find an ending and escape or run back in madness to meet
the following fear 
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water  a sound hard and clear as a stone
falling into a dream of dark shadow  light grew  and lo  the company passed
through another gateway  high-arched and broad  and a rill ran out beside them 
and beyond  going steeply down  was a road between sheer cliffs  knife-edged
against the sky far above  so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky was
dark  and in it small stars glinted  yet as gimli after learned it was still two
hours ere sunset of the day on which they had set out from dunharrow  though for
all that he could then tell it might have been twilight in some later year  or
in some other world 
the company now mounted again  and gimli returned to legolas  they rode in
file  and evening came on and a deep blue dusk  and still fear pursued them 
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the dwarf saw before his face
the glitter in the elf’s bright eyes  behind them rode elladan  last of the
company  but not the last of those that took the downward road 
‘the dead are following ’ said legolas  ‘i see shapes of men and of
horses  and pale banners like shreds of cloud  and spears like winter-thickets
on a misty night  the dead are following ’
‘yes  the dead ride behind  they have been summoned ’ said elladan 
the company came at last out of the ravine  as suddenly as it they had issued
from a crack in a wall  and there lay the uplands of a great vale before them 
and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over many falls 
‘where in middle-earth are we ’ said gimli  and elladan answered  ‘we
have descended from the uprising of the morthond  the long chill river that
flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of dol amroth  you will not need
to ask hereafter how comes its name  blackroot men call it ’
the morthond vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern
faces of the mountains  its steep slopes were grass-grown  but all was grey in
that hour  for the sun had gone  and far below lights twinkled in the homes of
men  the vale was rich and many folk dwelt there 
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear  ‘friends 
forget your weariness  ride now  ride  we must come to the stone of erech ere
this day passes  and long still is the way ’ so without looking back they rode
the mountain-fields  until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent and
found a road that went down into the land 
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came  and doors were shut  and
folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer  ever there
rose the same cry in the gathering night  ‘the king of the dead  the king of
the dead is come upon us ’
bells were ringing far below  and all men fled before the face of aragorn 
but the grey company in their haste rode like hunters  until their horses were
stumbling with weariness  and thus  just ere midnight  and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the mountains  they came at last to the hill of erech 
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty fields
about it  for upon the top stood a black stone  round as a great globe  the
height of a man  though its half was buried in the ground  unearthly it looked 
as though it had fallen from the sky  as some
believed  but those who remembered still the lore of westernesse told that it
had been brought out of the ruin of númenor and there set by isildur at
his landing  none of the people of the valley dared to approach it  nor
would they dwell near  for they said that it was a trysting-place of the
shadow-men  and there they would gather in times of fear  thronging round the
stone and whispering 
to that stone the company came and halted in the dead of night  then elrohir
gave to aragorn a silver horn  and he blew upon it and it seemed to those that
stood near that they heard a sound of answering horns  as if it was an echo in
deep caves far away  no other sound they heard  and yet they were aware of a
great host gathered all about the hill on which they stood  and a chill wind
like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains  but aragorn dismounted 
and standing by the stone he cried in a great voice 
‘oathbreakers  why have ye come ’
and a voice was heard out of the night that answered him  as if from far
away 
‘to fulfil our oath and have peace ’
then aragorn said  ‘the hour is come at last  now i go to pelargir upon
anduin  and ye shall come after me  and when all this land is clean of the
servants of sauron  i will hold the oath fulfilled  and ye shall have peace and
depart for ever  for i am elessar  isildur’s heir of gondor ’
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had
brought  and behold  it was black  and if there was any device upon it  it was
hidden in the darkness  then there was silence  and not a whisper nor a sigh was
heard again all the long night  the company camped beside the stone  but they
slept little  because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round 
but when the dawn came  cold and pale  aragorn rose at once  and he led the
company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among
them had known  save he alone  and only his will held them to go on  no other
mortal men could have endured it  none but the dúnedain
of the north  and with them gimli the dwarf and legolas of the elves 
they passed tarlang’s neck and came into lamedon  and the shadow host
pressed behind and fear went on before them  until they came to calembel upon
ciril  and the sun went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west
behind them  the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted  for many
men had gone away to war  and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead  but the next day there came no dawn  and
the grey company passed on into the darkness of the storm of mordor and were
lost to mortal sight  but the dead followed them 
 
now all roads were running together to the east to meet the coming of war and
the onset of the shadow  and even as pippin stood at the great gate of the city
and saw the prince of dol amroth ride in with his banners  the king of rohan
came down out of the hills 
day was waning  in the last rays of the sun the riders cast long pointed
shadows that went on before them  darkness had already crept beneath the
murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides  the king rode now
slowly at the end of the day  presently the path turned round a huge bare
shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft-sighing trees  down  down
they went in a long winding file  when at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places  the sun was gone 
twilight lay upon the waterfalls 
all day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass
behind  cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad walls  and now through a stony
gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale  the riders followed it  and
suddenly harrowdale lay before them  loud with the noise of waters in the
evening  there the white snowbourn  joined by the lesser stream  went rushing 
fuming on the stones  down to edoras and the green hills and the plains  away to
the right at the head of the great dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its
vast buttresses swathed in cloud  but its jagged peak  clothed in everlasting
snow  gleamed far above the world  blue-shadowed upon the east  red-stained by
the sunset in the west 
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country  of which he had heard
many tales upon their long road  it was a skyless world  in which his eye 
through dim gulfs of shadowy air  saw only ever-mounting slopes  great walls of
stone behind great walls  and frowning precipices wreathed with mist  he sat for
a moment half dreaming  listening to the noise of water  the whisper of dark
trees  the crack of stone  and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all
sound  he loved mountains  or he had loved the thought of them marching on the
edge of stories brought from far away  but now he was borne down by the
insupportable weight of middle-earth  he longed to shut out the immensity in a
quiet room by a fire 
he was very tired  for though they had ridden slowly  they had ridden with
very little rest  hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had jogged up
and down  over passes  and through long dales  and across many streams 
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king’s side  not
noticing that many of the riders smiled to see the
two together  the hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony  and the lord of rohan
on his great white horse  then he had talked to théoden  telling him
about his home and the doings of the shire-folk  or listening in turn to tales
of the mark and its mighty men of old  but most of the time  especially
on this last day  merry had ridden by himself just behind the king  saying
nothing  and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of rohan that he
heard the men behind him using  it was a language in which there seemed to be
many words that he knew  though spoken more richly and strongly than in the
shire  yet he could not piece the words together  at times some rider would lift
up his clear voice in stirring song  and merry felt his heart leap  though he
did not know what it was about 
all the same he had been lonely  and never more so than now at the day’s
end  he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to  and what
would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli  then suddenly like a cold touch
on his heart he thought of frodo and sam  ‘i am forgetting them ’ he said to
himself reproachfully  ‘and yet they are more important than all the rest of
us  and i came to help them  but now they must be hundreds of miles away  if
they are still alive ’ he shivered 
‘harrowdale at last ’ said éomer  ‘our journey is almost at an
end ’ they halted  the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply  only a
glimpse  as through a tall window  could be seen of the great valley in the
gloaming below  a single small light could be seen twinkling by the
river 
‘this journey is over  maybe ’ said théoden  ‘but i have far yet
to go  last night the moon was full  and in the morning i shall ride to edoras
to the gathering of the mark ’
‘but if you would take my counsel ’ said
éomer in a low voice  ‘you would then return hither  until the war is
over  lost or won ’
théoden smiled  ‘nay  my son  for so i will call you  speak not the
soft words of wormtongue in my old ears ’ he drew himself up and looked back
at the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind  ‘long years in
the space of days it seems since i rode west  but never will i lean on a staff
again  if the war is lost  what good will be my hiding in the hills  and if it
is won  what grief will it be  even if i fall  spending my last strength  but we
will leave this now  tonight i will lie in the hold of dunharrow  one evening of
peace at least is left us  let us ride on ’
in the deepening dusk they came down into the valley  here the snowbourn
flowed near to the western walls of the dale  and soon the path led them to a
ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones  the ford was
guarded  as the king approached many men sprang up out of the shadow of the
rocks  and when they saw the king they cried with
glad voices  ‘théoden king  théoden king  the king of the mark
returns ’
then one blew a long call on a horn  it echoed in the valley  other horns
answered it  and lights shone out across the river 
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above  sounding
from some hollow place  as it seemed  that gathered their notes into one voice
and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone 
so the king of the mark came back victorious out of the west to dunharrow
beneath the feet of the white mountains  there he
found the remaining strength of his people already assembled  for as soon as his
coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford  bearing messages from
gandalf  dúnhere  chieftain of the folk of harrowdale  was at
their head 
‘at dawn three days ago  lord ’ he said  ‘shadowfax came like a wind
out of the west to edoras  and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to
gladden our hearts  but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathering of
the riders  and then came the winged shadow ’
‘the winged shadow ’ said théoden  ‘we saw it also  but that was
in the dead of night before gandalf left us ’
‘maybe  lord ’ said dúnhere  ‘yet the same  or another like to
it  a flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird  passed over
edoras that morning  and all men were shaken with fear  for it stooped upon
meduseld  and as it came low  almost to the gable  there came a cry that stopped
our hearts  then it was that gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the
fields  but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains  and he bade us
to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked  so it has been done 
gandalf spoke with great authority  we trust that it is as you would wish 
naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things ’
‘it is well ’ said théoden  ‘i will ride now to the hold  and
there before i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains  let them come
to me as soon as may be ’
the road now led eastward straight across the valley  which was at that point
little more than half a mile in width  flats and meads of rough grass  grey now
in the falling night  lay all about  but in front on the far side of the dale
merry saw a frowning wall  a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn 
cloven by the river in ages past 
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of men  some thronged to
the roadside  hailing the king and the riders from the west with glad cries  but
stretching away into the distance behind there were ordered rows of tents and
booths  and lines of picketed horses  and great store of arms  and piled spears
bristling like thickets of new-planted trees  now all the great assembly was
falling into shadow  and yet  though the night-chill blew cold from the heights
no lanterns glowed  no fires were lit  watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and
fro 
merry wondered how many riders there were  he could not guess their number in
the gathering gloom  but it looked to him like a great army  many thousands
strong  while he was peering from side to side the king’s party came up under
the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley  and there suddenly the path
began to climb  and merry looked up in amazement  he was on a road the like of
which he had never seen before  a great work of men’s hands in years beyond
the reach of song  upwards it wound  coiling like a snake  boring its way across
the sheer slope of rock  steep as a stair  it looped backwards and forwards as
it climbed  up it horses could walk  and wains could be slowly hauled  but no
enemy could come that way  except out of the air  if it was defended from above 
at each turn of the road there were great standing stones that had been carved
in the likeness of men  huge and clumsy-limbed  squatting cross-legged with
their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies  some in
the wearing of the years had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes
that still stared sadly at the passers-by  the riders hardly glanced at them 
the púkel-men they called them  and heeded them little  no power
or terror was left in them  but merry gazed at them with wonder and a feeling
almost of pity  as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk 
after a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some
hundreds of feet above the valley  but still far below he could dimly see a
winding line of riders crossing the ford and filing along the road towards the
camp prepared for them  only the king and his guard were going up into the hold 
at last the king’s company came to a sharp brink  and the climbing road
passed into a cutting between walls of rock  and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland  the firienfeld men called it  a green mountain-field of
grass and heath  high above the deep-delved courses of the snowbourn  laid upon
the lap of the great mountains behind  the starkhorn southwards  and northwards
the saw-toothed mass of irensaga  between which there faced the riders  the grim
black wall of the dwimorberg  the haunted mountain rising out of steep slopes of
sombre pines  dividing the upland into two there marched a double line of
unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees 
those who dared to follow that road came soon to the black dimholt under
dwimorberg  and the menace of the pillar of stone  and the yawning shadow of the
forbidden door 
such was the dark dunharrow  the work of long-forgotten men  their name was
lost and no song or legend remembered it  for what purpose they had made this
place  as a town or secret temple or a tomb of kings  none
could say  here they laboured in the dark years  before ever a ship came to the
western shores  or gondor of the dúnedain was built  and now they had
vanished  and only the old púkel-men were left  still sitting at the
turnings of the road 
merry stared at the lines of marching stones  they were worn and black  some
were leaning  some were fallen  some cracked or broken  they looked like rows of
old and hungry teeth  he wondered what they could be  and he hoped that the king
was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond  then he saw that there
were clusters of tents and booths on either side of the stony way  but these
were not set near the trees  and seemed rather to huddle away from them towards
the brink of the cliff  the greater number were on the right  where the
firienfeld was wider  and on the left there was a smaller camp  in the midst of
which stood a tall pavilion  from this side a rider now came out to meet them 
and they turned from the road 
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was a woman with long braided hair
gleaming in the twilight  yet she wore a helm and was clad to the waist like a
warrior and girded with a sword 
‘hail  lord of the mark ’ she cried  ‘my heart is glad at your
returning ’
‘and you  éowyn ’ said théoden  ‘is all well with
you ’
‘all is well ’ she answered  yet it seemed to merry that her voice belied
her  and he would have thought that she had been weeping  if that could be
believed of one so stern of face  ‘all is well  it was a weary road for the
people to take  torn suddenly from their homes  there were hard words  for it is
long since war has driven us from the green fields  but there have been no evil
deeds  all is now ordered  as you see  and your lodging is prepared for you  for
i have had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming ’
‘so aragorn has come then ’ said éomer  ‘is he still here ’
‘no  he is gone ’ said éowyn turning away and looking at the
mountains dark against the east and south 
‘whither did he go ’ asked éomer 
‘i do not know ’ she answered  ‘he came at night  and rode away
yestermorn  ere the sun had climbed over the mountain-tops  he is gone ’
‘you are grieved  daughter ’ said théoden  ‘what has happened 
tell me  did he speak of that road ’ he pointed away along the darkening
lines of stones towards the dwimorberg  ‘of the paths of the dead ’
‘yes  lord ’ said éowyn  ‘and he has passed into the shadows
from which none have returned  i could not dissuade him  he is gone ’
‘then our paths are sundered ’ said éomer  ‘he is lost  we
must ride without him  and our hope dwindles ’
slowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass  speaking no
more  until they came to the king’s pavilion  there merry found that
everything was made ready  and that he himself was not forgotten  a little tent
had been pitched for him beside the king’s lodging  and there he sat alone 
while men passed to and fro  going in to the king and taking counsel with him 
night came on  and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned
with stars  but the east was dark and blank  the marching stones faded slowly
from sight  but still beyond them  blacker than the gloom  brooded the vast
crouching shadow of the dwimorberg 
‘the paths of the dead ’ he muttered to himself  ‘the paths of the
dead  what does all this mean  they have all left me now  they have all gone to
some doom  gandalf and pippin to war in the east  and sam and frodo to mordor 
and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead  but my turn will
come soon enough  i suppose  i wonder what they are all talking about  and what
the king means to do  for i must go where he goes now ’
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very
hungry  and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the
same  but at that very moment a trumpet sounded  and a man came summoning him 
the king’s esquire  to wait at the king’s board 
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small space  curtained off with
broidered hangings  and strewn with skins  and
there at a small table sat théoden with éomer and éowyn 
and dúnhere  lord of harrowdale  merry stood beside the king’s stool
and waited on him till presently the old man  coming out of deep thought  turned
to him and smiled 
‘come  master meriadoc ’ he said  ‘you shall not stand  you shall sit
beside me  as long as i remain in my own lands  and lighten my heart with
tales ’
room was made for the hobbit at the king’s left hand  but no one called for
any tale  there was indeed little speech  and they ate and drank for the most
part in silence  until at last  plucking up courage  merry asked the question
that was tormenting him 
‘twice now  lord  i have heard of the paths of the dead ’ he said 
‘what are they  and where has strider  i mean the lord aragorn where has he
gone ’
the king sighed  but no one answered  until at last éomer spoke  ‘we
do not know  and our hearts are heavy ’ he said  ‘but as for the paths of
the dead  you have yourself walked on their first steps  nay  i speak no words
of ill omen  the road that we have climbed is the approach to the door 
yonder in the dimholt  but what lies beyond no man knows ’
‘no man knows ’ said théoden  ‘yet ancient legend  now seldom
spoken  has somewhat to report  if these old tales speak true that have come
down from father to son in the house of eorl  then the door under dwimorberg
leads to a secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end  but
none have ever ventured in to search its secrets  since baldor  son of brego 
passed the door and was never seen among men again  a rash vow he spoke  as he
drained the horn at that feast which brego made to hallow new-built meduseld 
and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir 
‘folk say that dead men out of the dark years guard the way and will suffer
no living man to come to their hidden halls  but at whiles they may themselves
be seen passing out of the door like shadows and down the stony road  then the
people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and shroud their windows and are
afraid  but the dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and
coming death ’
‘yet it is said in harrowdale ’ said éowyn in a low voice  ‘that
in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed
by  whence they came none knew  but they went up the stony road and
vanished into the hill  as if they went to keep a tryst ’
‘then why has aragorn gone that way ’ asked merry  ‘don’t you know
anything that would explain it ’
‘unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that
we have not heard ’ said éomer  ‘none now in the land of the living
can tell his purpose ’
‘greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw him first in the king’s
house ’ said éowyn  ‘grimmer  older  fey i thought him  and like one
whom the dead call ’
‘maybe he was called ’ said théoden 
‘and my heart tells me that i shall not see him again  yet he is a kingly man
of high destiny  and take comfort in this  daughter  since comfort you seem to
need in your grief for this guest  it is said that when the eorlingas
came out of the north and passed at length up the snowbourn  seeking strong
places of refuge in time of need  brego and his son baldor climbed the stair of
the hold and so came before the door  on the threshold sat an old man  aged
beyond guess of years  tall and kingly he had been  but now he was withered as
an old stone  indeed for stone they took him  for he moved not  and he said no
word  until they sought to pass him by and enter  and then a voice came out of
him  as it were out of the ground  and to their amaze it spoke in the western
tongue  the way is shut 
‘then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still  but he did
not look at them  the way is shut  his voice said again it was made by
those who are dead  and the dead keep it  until the time comes  the way is shut 
‘and when will that time be  said baldor  but no answer did he ever
get  for the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face  and no other
tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned  yet
maybe at last the time foretold has come  and aragorn may pass ’
‘but how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no  save by
daring the door ’ said éomer  ‘and that way i would not go though all
the hosts of mordor stood before me  and i were alone and had no other
refuge  alas that a fey mood should fall on a man so greathearted in this hour
of need  are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the
earth  war is at hand ’
he paused  for at that moment there was a noise
outside  a man’s voice crying the name of théoden  and the challenge of
the guard 
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain  ‘a man is
here  lord ’ he said  ‘an errand-rider of gondor  he wishes to come before
you at once ’
‘let him come ’ said théoden 
a tall man entered  and merry choked back a cry  for a moment it seemed to
him that boromir was alive again and had returned  then he saw that it was not
so  the man was a stranger  though as like to boromir as if he were one of his
kin  tall and grey-eyed and proud  he was clad as a rider with a cloak of dark
green over a coat of fine mail  on the front of his helm was wrought a small
silver star  in his hand he bore a single arrow  black-feathered and barbed with
steel  but the point was painted red 
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to théoden  ‘hail lord
of the rohirrim  friend of gondor ’ he said  ‘hirgon i am  errand-rider of
denethor  who bring you this token of war  gondor is in great need  often the
rohirrim have aided us  but now the lord denethor asks for all your
strength and all your speed  lest gondor fall at last ’
‘the red arrow ’ said théoden  holding it  as one who receives a
summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes  his hand trembled  ‘the
red arrow has not been seen in the mark in all my years  has it indeed
come to that  and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my strength and
all my speed may be ’
‘that is best known to yourself  lord ’ said hirgon  ‘but ere long it
may well come to pass that minas tirith is surrounded  and unless you have the
strength to break a siege of many powers  the lord denethor bids me say that he
judges that the strong arms of the rohirrim would be better within his walls
than without ’
‘but he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon horseback and in
the open  and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for the
gathering of our riders  is it not true  hirgon  that the lord of minas tirith
knows more than he sets in his message  for we are already at war  as you may
have seen  and you do not find us all unprepared  gandalf the grey has been
among us  and even now we are mustering for battle in the east ’
‘what the lord denethor may know or guess of all these things i cannot
say ’ answered hirgon  ‘but indeed our case is desperate  my lord does not
issue any command to you  he begs you only to remember old friendship and oaths
long spoken  and for your own good to do all that you may  it is reported to us
that many kings have ridden in from the east to the service of mordor  from the
north to the field of dagorlad there is skirmish and rumour of war  in the south
the haradrim are moving  and fear has fallen on all our coastlands  so that
little help will come to us thence  make haste  for it is before the walls of
minas tirith that the doom of our time will be decided  and if the tide be not
stemmed there  then it will flow over all the fair fields of rohan  and even in
this hold among the hills there shall be no refuge ’
‘dark tidings ’ said théoden  ‘yet not all unguessed  but
say to denethor that even if rohan itself felt no peril  still we would come to
his aid  but we have suffered much loss in our battles with saruman the traitor 
and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east  as his own
tidings make clear  so great a power as the dark lord seems now to wield might
well contain us in battle before the city and yet strike with great force across
the river away beyond the gate of kings 
‘but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence  we will come  the
weapontake was set for the morrow  when all is ordered we will set out  ten
thousand spears i might have sent riding over the plain to the dismay of your
foes  it will be less now  i fear  for i will not leave my strongholds all
unguarded  yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me  for say to
denethor that in this hour the king of the mark himself will come down to the
land of gondor  though maybe he will not ride back  but it is a long road  and
man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight  a week it may be from
tomorrow’s morn ere you hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the
north 
‘a week ’ said hirgon  ‘if it must be so  it must  but you are like to
find only ruined walls in seven days from now  unless other help unlooked-for
comes  still  you may at the least disturb the orcs and swarthy men from their
feasting in the white tower ’
‘at the least we will do that ’ said théoden  ‘but i myself am
new-come from battle and long journey  and i will now go to rest  tarry
here this night  then you shall look on the muster of rohan and ride away the
gladder for the sight  and the swifter for the rest  in the morning counsels are
best  and night changes many thoughts 
with that the king stood up  and they all rose  ‘go now each to your
rest ’ he said  ‘and sleep well  and you  master meriadoc  i need no more
tonight  but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen ’
‘i will be ready ’ said merry  ‘even if you bid me ride with you on the
paths of the dead ’
‘speak not words of omen ’ said the king  ‘for there may be more roads
than one that could bear that name  but i did not say that i would bid you ride
with me on any road  good night ’
‘i won’t be left behind  to be called for on return ’ said merry  ‘i
won’t be left  i won’t ’ and repeating this over and over again to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent 
he was wakened by a man shaking him  ‘wake up  wake up  master holbytla ’
he cried  and at length merry came out of deep dreams and sat up with a start 
it still seemed very dark  he thought 
‘what is the matter ’ he asked 
‘the king calls for you ’
‘but the sun has not risen  yet ’ said merry 
‘no  and will not rise today  master holbytla  nor ever again  one would
think under this cloud  but time does not stand still  though the sun be lost 
make haste ’
flinging on some clothes  merry looked outside  the world was darkling  the
very air seemed brown  and all things about were black and grey and shadowless 
there was a great stillness  no shape of cloud could be seen  unless it were far
away westward  where the furthest groping fingers of the great gloom still
crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them  overhead there hung a
heavy roof  sombre and featureless  and light seemed rather to be failing than
growing 
merry saw many folk standing  looking up and muttering  all their faces were
grey and sad  and some were afraid  with a sinking heart he made his way to the
king  hirgon the rider of gondor was there before him  and beside him stood now
another man  like him and dressed alike  but shorter and broader  as merry
entered he was speaking to the king 
‘it comes from mordor  lord ’ he said  ‘it began last night at sunset 
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i saw it rise and creep across the
sky  and all night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars  now the great
cloud hangs over all the land between here and the mountains of shadow  and it
is deepening  war has already begun ’
for a while the king sat silent  at last he spoke  ‘so we come to it in the
end ’ he said  ‘the great battle of our time  in which many things shall
pass away  but at least there is no longer need for hiding  we will ride the
straight way and the open road and with all our speed  the muster shall begin at
once  and wait for none that tarry  have you good store in minas tirith  for if
we must ride now in all haste  then we must ride light  with but meal and water
enough to last us into battle ’
‘we have very great store long prepared ’ answered hirgon  ride now as
light and as swift as you may ’
‘then call the heralds  éomer ’ said théoden  ‘let the
riders be marshalled ’
éomer went out  and presently the trumpets rang in the hold and were
answered by many others from below  but their voices no longer sounded clear
and brave as they had seemed to merry the night before  dull they seemed and
harsh in the heavy air  braying ominously 
the king turned to merry  ‘i am going to war  master meriadoc ’ he said 
‘in a little while i shall take the road  i release you from
my service  but not from my friendship  you shall abide here  and if you will 
you shall serve the lady éowyn  who will govern the folk in my stead ’
‘but  but  lord ’ merry stammered  ‘i offered you my sword  i do not
want to be parted from you like this  théoden
king  and as all my friends have gone to the battle’ i should be ashamed to
stay behind ’
‘but we ride on horses tall and swift ’ said théoden  ‘and great
though your heart be  you cannot ride on such beasts ’
‘then tie me on to the back of one  or let me hang on a stirrup  or
something ’ said merry  ‘it is a long way to run  but run i shall  if i
cannot ride  even if i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late ’
théoden smiled  ‘rather than that i would bear you with me on
snowmane ’ he said  ‘but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld  for that way i shall go  so far stybba can bear
you  the great race will not begin till we reach the plains ’
then éowyn rose up  ‘come now  meriadoc ’ she said  ‘i will show
you the gear that i have prepared fur you ’ they went out together  ‘this
request only did aragorn make to me ’ said éowyn  as they passed among
the tents  ‘that you should be armed for battle  i have granted it  as i
could  for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end ’
now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of the king’s guard and there
an armourer brought out to her a small helm  and a round shield  and other gear 
‘no mail have we to fit you ’ said éowyn  ‘nor any time for the
forging of such a hauberk  but here is also a stout jerkin of leather  a
belt  and a knife  a sword you have ’
merry bowed  and the lady showed him the shield  which was like the shield
that had been given to gimli  and it bore on it the device of the white horse 
‘take all these things ’ she said  ‘and bear them to good fortune 
farewell now  master meriadoc  yet maybe we shall meet again  you and i ’
so it was that amid a gathering gloom the king of the mark made ready to lead
all his riders on the eastward road  hearts were heavy and many quailed in the
shadow  but they were a stern people  loyal to their lord  and little weeping or
murmuring was heard  even in the camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras
were housed  women and children and old men  doom hung over them  but they faced
it silently 
two swift hours passed  and now the king sat upon his white horse  glimmering
in the half light  proud and tall he seemed  though the hair that flowed beneath
his high helm was like snow  and many marvelled at him and took heart to see him
unbent and unafraid 
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many
companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of riders fully armed  and many
hundreds of other men with spare horses lightly burdened  a single
trumpet sounded  the king raised his hand  and then silently the host of the
mark began to move  foremost went twelve of the king’s household-men  riders
of renown  then the king followed with éomer on his right  he had said
farewell to éowyn above in the hold  and the memory was grievous 
but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead  behind him merry rode on
stybba with the errand riders of gondor  and behind them again twelve more of
the king’s household  they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with
stern and unmoved faces  but when they had come almost to the end of the line
one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit  a young man  merry thought as he
returned the glance  less in height and girth than most  he caught the glint of
clear grey eyes  and then he shivered  for it came suddenly to him that it was
the face of one without hope who goes in search of death 
on down the grey road they went beside the snowbourn rushing on its stones 
through the hamlets of underharrow and upbourn  where many sad faces of women
looked out from dark doors  and so without horn or harp or music of men’s
voices the great ride into the east began with which the songs of rohan were
busy for many long lives of men thereafter 
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning

with thane and captain rode thengel’s son 

to edoras he came  the ancient halls

of the mark-wardens mist-enshrouded 

golden timbers were in gloom mantled 

farewell he bade to his free people 

hearth and high-seat  and the hallowed places 

where long he had feasted ere the light faded 

forth rode the king  fear behind him 

fate before him  fealty kept he 

oaths he had taken  all fulfilled them 

forth rode théoden  five nights and days

east and onward rode the eorlingas

through folde and fenmarch and the firienwood 

six thousand spears to sunlending 

mundburg the mighty under mindolluin 

sea-kings’ city in the south-kingdom

foe-beleaguered  fire-encircled 

doom drove them on  darkness took them 

horse and horseman  hoofbeats afar

sank into silence  so the songs tell us 
it was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to edoras  although it
was then but noon by the hour  there he halted only a short while and
strengthened his host by some three score of riders that came late to the
weapontake  now having eaten he made ready to set out again  and he wished his
esquire a kindly farewell  but merry begged for the last time not to be parted
from him 
‘this is no journey for such steeds as stybba  as i have told you ‘ said
théoden  ‘and in such a battle as we think to make on the fields
of gondor what would you do  master meriadoc  sword-thain though you be  and
greater of heart than of stature ’
‘as for that  who can tell ’ answered merry  ‘but why  lord  did you
receive me as sword-thain  if not to stay by your side  and i would not have it
said of me in song only that i was always left behind ’
‘i received you for your safe-keeping ’ answered théoden  ‘and
also to do as i might bid  none of my riders can bear you as burden  if the
battle were before my gates  maybe your deeds would be remembered by the
minstrels  but it is a hundred leagues and two to mundburg where denethor is
lord  i will say no more ’
merry bowed and went away unhappily  and stared at the lines of horsemen 
already the companies were preparing to start  men were tightening girths 
looking to saddles  caressing their horses  some gazed uneasily at the lowering
sky  unnoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit’s ear 
‘where will wants not  a way opens  so we say ’ he whispered 
‘and so i have found myself ’ merry looked up and saw that it was the young
rider whom he had noticed in the morning  ‘you wish to go whither the lord of
the mark goes  i see it in your face ’
‘i do ’ said merry 
‘then you shall go with me ’ said the rider  ‘i will bear you before
me  under my cloak until we are far afield  and this darkness is yet darker 
such good will should not be denied  say no more to any man  but come ’
‘thank you indeed ’ said merry  ‘thank you  sir  though i do not know
your name ’
‘do you not ’ said the rider softly  ‘then call me dernhelm ’
thus it came to pass that when the king set out  before dernhelm sat meriadoc
the hobbit  and the great grey steed windfola made little of the burden  for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men  though lithe and well-knit in frame 
on into the shadow they rode  in the willow-thickets where snowbourn flowed
into entwash  twelve leagues east of edoras  they camped that night  and then on
again through the folde  and through the fenmarch  where to their right great
oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor  but away to their left the mists lay on the marshes
fed by the mouths of entwash  and as they rode rumour came of war in the north 
lone men  riding wild  brought word of foes assailing their east-borders  of
orc-hosts marching in the wold of rohan 
‘ride on  ride on ’ cried éomer  ‘too late now to turn aside 
the fens of entwash must guard our flank  haste now we need  ride on ’
and so king théoden departed from his own
realm  and mile by mile the long road wound away  and the beacon hills marched
past  calenhad  min-rimmon  erelas  nardol  but their fires were quenched  all
the lands were grey and still  and ever the shadow deepened before them 
and hope waned in every heart 
 
pippin was roused by gandalf  candles were lit in their chamber  for only a
dim twilight came through the windows  the air was heavy as with approaching
thunder 
‘what is the time ’ said pippin yawning 
‘past the second hour ’ said gandalf  ‘time to get up and make yourself
presentable  you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new
duties ’
‘and will he provide breakfast ’
‘no  i have provided it  all that you will get till noon  food is now doled
out by order ’
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and  he thought  very inadequate pat
of butter which was set out for him  beside a cup of thin milk  ‘why did you
bring me here ’ he said 
‘you know quite well ’ said gandalf  ‘to keep you out of mischief  and
if you do not like being here  you can remember that you brought it on
yourself ’ pippin said no more 
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down the cold corridor to
the door of the tower hall  there denethor sat in a grey gloom  like an old
patient spider  pippin thought  he did not seem to have moved since the day
before  he beckoned gandalf to a seat  but pippin was left for a while standing
unheeded  presently the old man turned to him 
‘well  master peregrin  i hope that you used yesterday to your profit  and
to your liking  though i fear that the board is barer in this city than you
could wish ’
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or done was
somehow known to the lord of the city  and much was guessed of what he thought
as well  he did not answer 
‘what would you do in my service ’
‘i thought  sir  that you would tell me my duties ’
‘i will  when i learn what you are fit for ’ said denethor  ‘but that i
shall learn soonest  maybe  if i keep you beside me  the esquire of my chamber
has begged leave to go to the out-garrison  so you shall take his place for a
while  you shall wait on me  bear errands  and talk to me  if war and council
leave me any leisure  can you sing ’
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘well  yes  well enough for my own people  but we
have no songs fit for great halls and evil times  lord  we seldom sing of
anything more terrible than wind or rain  and most of my songs are about things
that make us laugh  or about food and drink  of course ’
‘and why should such songs be unfit for my halls  or for such hours as
these  we who have lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes from
a land untroubled by it  then we may feel that our vigil was not fruitless 
though it may have been thankless ’
pippin’s heart sank  he did not relish the idea of singing any song of the
shire to the lord of minas tirith  certainly not the comic ones that he knew
best  they were too  well  rustic for such an occasion  he was however spared
the ordeal for the present  he was not commanded to sing  denethor turned to
gandalf  asking questions about the rohirrim and their policies  and the
position of éomer  the king’s nephew  pippin marvelled at the amount
that the lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away  though
it must  he thought  be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad 
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while  ‘go
to the armouries of the citadel ’ he said  ‘and get you there the livery and
gear of the tower  it will be ready  it was commanded yesterday  return when you
are clad ’
it was as he said  and pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garments 
all of black and silver  he had a small hauberk  its rings forged of steel 
maybe  yet black as jet  and a high-crowned helm with small raven-wings on
either side  set with a silver star in the centre of the circlet  above the mail
was a short surcoat of black  but broidered on the breast in silver with the
token of the tree  his old clothes were folded and
put away  but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of lórien  though
not to wear it when on duty  he looked now  had he known it  verily ernil
i pheriannath  the prince of the halflings  that folk had called him  but he
felt uncomfortable  and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits 
it was dark and dim all day  from the sunless dawn until evening the heavy
shadow had deepened  and all hearts in the city were oppressed  far above a
great cloud streamed slowly westward from the black land  devouring light  borne
upon a wind of war  but below the air was still and breathless  as if all the
vale of anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm 
about the eleventh hour  released at last for a while from service  pippin
came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting more supportable  in the messes he met beregond again  who
had just come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard-towers upon the
causeway  together they strolled out to the walls  for pippin felt imprisoned
indoors  and stifled even in the lofty citadel  now they sat side by side again
in the embrasure looking eastward  where they had eaten and talked the day
before 
it was the sunset-hour  but the great pall had now stretched far into the
west  and only as it sank at last into the sea did the sun escape to send out a
brief farewell gleam before the night  even as frodo saw it at the cross-roads
touching the head of the fallen king  but to the fields of the pelennor  under
the shadow of mindolluin  there came no gleam  they were brown and drear 
already it seemed years to pippin since he had sat there before  in some
half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit  a light-hearted wanderer
touched little by the perils he had passed through  now he was one small soldier
in a city preparing for a great assault  clad in the proud but sombre manner of
the tower of guard 
in some other time and place pippin might have been pleased with his new
array  but he knew now that he was taking part in no play  he was in deadly
earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril  the hauberk was
burdensome  and the helm weighed upon his head  his cloak he had cast aside upon
the seat  he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields below and
yawned  and then he sighed 
‘you are weary of this day ’ said beregond 
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘very  tired out with idleness and waiting  i have
kicked my heels at the door of my master’s chamber for many slow hours  while
he has debated with gandalf and the prince and other great persons  and i’m
not used  master beregond  to waiting hungry on others while they eat  it is a
sore trial for a hobbit  that  no doubt you will think i should feel the honour
more deeply  but what is the good of such honour  indeed what is the good even
of food and drink under this creeping shadow  what does it mean  the very air
seems thick and brown  do you often have such glooms when the wind is in the
east ’
‘nay ’ said beregond  ‘this is no weather of the world  this is some
device of his malice  some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he sends
to darken hearts and counsel  and so it doth indeed  i wish the lord faramir
would return  he would not be dismayed  but now  who knows if he will ever come
back across the river out of the darkness ’
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘gandalf  too  is anxious  he was disappointed  i
think  not to find faramir here  and where has he got to himself  he left the
lord’s council before the noon-meal  and in no good mood either  i thought 
perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news ’
suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb  frozen as it were to
listening stones  pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears  but
beregond  who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir 
remained there  stiffened  staring out with starting eyes  pippin knew the
shuddering cry that he had heard  it was the same that he had heard long ago in
the marish of the shire  but now it was grown in power and hatred  piercing the
heart with a poisonous despair 
at last beregond spoke with an effort  ‘they have come ’ he said  ‘take
courage and look  there are fell things below ’
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall  the
pelennor lay dim beneath him  fading away to the scarce guessed line of the
great river  but now wheeling swiftly across it  like shadows of untimely night 
he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms  horrible as
carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles  cruel as death  now they swooped near 
venturing almost within bowshot of the walls  now they circled away 
‘black riders ’ muttered pippin  ‘black riders of the air  but see 
beregond ’ he cried  ‘they are looking for something  surely  see how they
wheel and swoop  always down to that point over there  and can you see something
moving on the ground  dark little things  yes  men on horses  four or five  ah 
i cannot stand it  gandalf  gandalf save us ’
another long screech rose and fell  and he threw himself back again from the
wall  panting like a hunted animal  faint and seemingly remote through that
shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending on a
long high note 
‘faramir  the lord faramir  it is his call ’ cried beregond  ‘brave
heart  but how can he win to the gate  if these foul hell-hawks have other
weapons than fear  but look  they hold on  they will make the gate  no  the
horses are running mad  look  the men are thrown  they are running on foot  no 
one is still up  but he rides back to the others  that will be the captain  he
can master both beasts and men  ah  there one of the foul things is stooping on
him  help  help  will no one go out to him  faramir ’
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom  ashamed of his
terror  while beregond of the guard thought first of the captain whom he loved 
pippin got up and peered out  at that moment he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north  like a small star down on the dusky fields  it
moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came  converging swiftly with
the flight of the four men towards the gate  it seemed to pippin that a pale
light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it  and then as
it drew near he thought that he heard  like an echo in the walls  a great voice
calling 
‘gandalf ’ he cried  ‘gandalf  he always turns up when things are
darkest  go on  go on  white rider  gandalf  gandalf ’ he shouted wildly  like
an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond encouragement 
but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer  one wheeled
towards him  but it seemed to pippin that he raised his hand  and from it a
shaft of white light stabbed upwards  the nazgûl gave a long wailing cry
and swerved away  and with that the four others wavered  and then rising
in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the lowering cloud
above  and down on the pelennor it seemed for a while less dark 
pippin watched  and he saw the horseman and the white rider meet and halt 
waiting for those on foot  men now hurried out to them from the city  and soon
they all passed from sight under the outer walls  and he knew that they were
entering the gate  guessing that they would come at once to the tower and the
steward  he hurried to the entrance of the citadel  there he was joined by many
others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls 
it was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the
outer circles  and there was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir
and mithrandir  presently pippin saw torches  and followed by a press of people
two horsemen riding slowly  one was in white but shining no longer  pale in the
twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled  the other was dark and his head was
bowed  they dismounted  and as grooms took shadowfax and the other horse  they
walked forward to the sentinel at the gate  gandalf steadily  his grey cloak
flung back  and a fire still smouldering in his eyes  the other  clad all in
green  slowly  swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man 
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch 
and when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught his breath  it was the face
of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish  but has mastered it and
now is quiet  proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard 
and pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother boromir - whom
pippin had liked from the first  admiring the great man’s lordly but kindly
manner  yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling
that he had not known before  here was one with an air of high nobility such as
aragorn at times revealed  less high perhaps  yet also less incalculable and
remote  one of the kings of men born into a later time  but touched with the
wisdom and sadness of the elder race  he knew now why beregond spoke his name
with love  he was a captain that men would follow  that he would follow  even
under the shadow of the black wings 
‘faramir ’ he cried aloud with the others  ‘faramir ’ and faramir
catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city  turned and
looked down at him and was amazed 
‘whence come you ’ he said  ‘a halfling  and in the livery of the
tower  whence… ’
but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke  ‘he came with me from
the land of the halflings ’ he said  ‘he came with me  but let us not tarry
here  there is much to say and to do  and you are weary  he shall come with us 
indeed he must  for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than i do 
he must attend on his lord again within this hour  come  pippin  follow us ’
so at length they came to the private chamber of the lord of the city  there
deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal  and wine was brought  and there
pippin  hardly noticed  stood behind the chair of denethor and felt his
weariness little  so eagerly did he listen to all that was said 
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine  he sat upon a
low chair at his father’s left hand  removed a little upon the other side sat
gandalf in a chair of carven wood  and he seemed at first to be asleep  for at
the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out
ten days before  and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the
enemy and his allies  and he told of the fight on the road when the men of harad
and their great beast were overthrown  a captain reporting to his master such
matters as had often been heard before  small things of border-war that now
seemed useless and petty  shorn of their renown 
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin  ‘but now we come to strange
matters ’ he said  ‘for this is not the first halfling that i have seen
walking out of northern legends into the southlands ’
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair  but he said
nothing  and with a look stopped the exclamation on pippin’s lips  denethor
looked at their faces and nodded his head  as though in sign that he had read
much there before it was spoken  slowly  while the others sat silent and still 
faramir told his tale  with his eyes for the most part on gandalf  though now
and again his glance strayed to pippin  as if to refresh his memory of others
that he had seen 
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo and his servant and of
the events at henneth annûn  pippin became aware that gandalf’s hands
were trembling as they clutched the carven wood  white they seemed now and very
old  and as he looked at them  suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin knew
that gandalf  gandalf himself  was troubled  even afraid  the air of the room
was close and still  at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the
travellers  and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol  his voice fell  and he
shook his head and sighed  then gandalf sprang up 
‘cirith ungol  morgul vale ’ he said  ‘the time  faramir  the time 
when did you part with them  when would they reach that accursed valley ’
‘i parted with them in the morning two days ago ’ said faramir  ‘it is
fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the morgulduin  if they went straight
south  and then they would be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower 
at swiftest they could not come there before today  and maybe they have not come
there yet  indeed i see what you fear  but the darkness is not due to their
venture  it began yestereve  and all ithilien was under shadow last night  it is
clear to me that the enemy has long planned an assault on us  and its hour had
already been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping ’
gandalf paced the floor  ‘the morning of two days ago  nigh on three days
of journey  how far is the place where you parted ’
‘some twenty-five leagues as a bird flies ’ answered faramir  ‘but i
could not come more swiftly  yestereve i lay at cair andros  the long isle in
the river northward which we hold in defence  and horses are kept on the hither
bank  as the dark drew on i knew that haste was needed  so i rode thence with
three others that could also be horsed  the rest of my company i sent south to
strengthen the garrison at the fords of osgiliath  i hope that i have not done
ill ’ he looked at his father 
‘ill ’ cried denethor  and his eyes flashed suddenly  ‘why do you ask 
the men were under your command  or do you ask for my judgement on all your
deeds  your bearing is lowly in my presence  yet it is long now since you turned
from your own way at my counsel  see  you have spoken skilfully  as ever  but i 
have i not seen your eye fixed on mithrandir  seeking whether you said well or
too much  he has long had your heart in his keeping 
‘my son  your father is old but not yet dotard  i can see and hear  as was
my wont  and little of what you have half said or left unsaid is now hidden from
me  i know the answer to many riddles  alas  alas for boromir ’
‘if what i have done displeases you  my father ’ said faramir quietly 
‘i wish i had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement
was thrust on me ’
‘would that have availed to change your judgement ’ said denethor  ‘you
would still have done just so  i deem  i know you well  ever your desire is to
appear lordly and generous as a king of old  gracious  gentle  that may well
befit one of high race  if he sits in power and peace  but in desperate hours
gentleness may be repaid with death ’
‘so be it ’ said faramir 
‘so be it ’ cried denethor  ‘but not with your death only  lord
faramir  with the death also of your father  and of all your people  whom it is
your part to protect now that boromir is gone ’
‘do you wish then ’ said faramir  ‘that our places had been
exchanged ’
‘yes  i wish that indeed ’ said denethor  ‘for boromir was loyal to me
and no wizard’s pupil  he would have remembered his father’s need  and would
not have squandered what fortune gave  he would have brought me a mighty
gift ’
for a moment faramir’s restraint gave way  ‘i would ask you  my father 
to remember why it was that i  not he  was in ithilien  on one occasion at least
your counsel has prevailed  not long ago  it was the lord of the city that gave
the errand to him ’
‘stir not the bitterness in the cup that i mixed for myself ’ said
denethor  ‘have i not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue foreboding that
worse yet lay in the dregs  as now indeed i find  would it were not so  would
that this thing had come to me ’
‘comfort yourself ’ said gandalf  ‘in no case would boromir have
brought it to you  he is dead  and died well  may he sleep in peace  yet you
deceive yourself  he would have stretched out his hand to this thing  and taking
it he would have fallen  he would have kept it for his own  and when he returned
you would not have known your son ’
the face of denethor set hard and cold  ‘you found boromir less apt to your
hand  did you not ’ he said softly  ‘but i who was his father say that he
would have brought it to me  you are wise  maybe  mithrandir  yet with all your
subtleties you have not all wisdom  counsels may be found that are neither the
webs of wizards nor the haste of fools  i have in this matter more lore and
wisdom than you deem  ‘
‘what then is your wisdom ’ said gandalf 
‘enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid  to use this thing
is perilous  at this hour  to send it in the hands of a witless halfling into
the land of the enemy himself  as you have done  and this son of mine  that is
madness ’
‘and the lord denethor what would he have done ’
‘neither  but most surely not for any argument would he have set this thing
at a hazard beyond all but a fool’s hope  risking our utter ruin  if the enemy
should recover what he lost  nay  it should have been kept  hidden  hidden dark
and deep  not used  i say  unless at the uttermost end of need  but set beyond
his grasp  save by a victory so final that what then befell would not trouble
us  being dead ’
‘you think  as is your wont  my lord  of gondor only ’ said gandalf 
‘yet there are other men and other lives  and time still to be  and for me  i
pity even his slaves ’
‘and where will other men look for help  if gondor falls ’ answered
denethor  ‘if i had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel  we
should not then shake with dread under this gloom  fearing the worst  and our
counsels would be undisturbed  if you do not trust me to endure the test  you do
not know me yet ’
‘nonetheless i do not trust you ’ said gandalf  ‘had i done so  i could
have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much
anguish  and now hearing you speak i trust you less  no more than boromir  nay 
stay your wrath  i do not trust myself in this  and i refused this thing  even
as a freely given gift  you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself  denethor  yet if you had received this thing  it would have overthrown
you  were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin  still it would burn your
mind away  as the darkness grows  and the yet worse things follow that soon
shall come upon us ’
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again as he faced gandalf  and
pippin felt once more the strain between their wills  but now almost it seemed
as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye  flickering as they fenced 
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke  but suddenly denethor relaxed and
grew cold again  he shrugged his shoulders 
‘if i had  if you had ’ he said  ‘such words and ifs are vain  it has
gone into the shadow  and only time will show what doom awaits it and us  the
time will not be long  in what is left  let all who fight the enemy in their
fashion be at one  and keep hope while they may  and after hope still the
hardihood to die free ’ he turned to faramir  ‘what think you of the
garrison at osgiliath ’
‘it is not strong ’ said faramir  ‘i have sent the company of ithilien
to strengthen it  as i have said ’
‘not enough  i deem ’ said denethor  ‘it is there that the first blow
will fall  they will have need of some stout captain there ’
‘there and elsewhere in many places ’ said faramir  and sighed  ‘alas
for my brother  whom i too loved ’ he rose  ‘may i have your leave 
father ’ and then he swayed and leaned upon his father’s chair 
‘you are weary  i see ’ said denethor  ‘you have ridden fast and far 
and under shadows of evil in the air  i am told ’
‘let us not speak of that ’ said faramir 
‘then we will not ’ said denethor  ‘go now and rest as you may 
tomorrow’s need will be sterner ’
all now took leave of the lord of the city and went to rest while they still
could  outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin beside him
bearing a small torch  made his way to their lodging  they did not speak until
they were behind closed doors  then at last pippin took gandalf’s hand 
‘tell me ’ he said  ‘is there any hope  for frodo  i mean  or at least
mostly for frodo ’
gandalf put his hand on pippin’s head  ‘there never was much hope ’ he
answered  ‘just a fool’s hope  as i have been told  and when i heard of
cirith ungol---‘ he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east  ‘cirith ungol ’ he muttered  ‘why that way 
i wonder ’ he turned  ‘just now  pippin  my heart almost failed me  hearing
that name  and yet in truth i believe that the news that faramir brings has some
hope in it  for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his war at last and
made the first move while frodo was still free  so now for many days he will
have his eye turned this way and that  away from his own land  and yet  pippin 
i feel from afar his haste and fear  he has begun sooner than he would 
something has happened to stir him ’
gandalf stood for a moment in thought  ‘maybe ’ he muttered  ‘maybe
even your foolishness helped  my lad  let me see  some five days ago now he
would discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone  still
what of that  we could not use it to much purpose  or without his knowing  ah  i
wonder  aragorn  his time draws near  and he is strong and stern underneath 
pippin  bold  determined  able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at
need  that may be it  he may have used the stone and shown himself to the enemy 
challenging him  for this very purpose  i wonder  well  we shall not know the
answer till the riders of rohan come  if they do not come too late  there are
evil days ahead  to sleep while we may ’
‘but ’ said pippin 
‘but what ’ said gandalf  ‘only one but will i allow tonight ’
‘gollum ’ said pippin  ‘how on earth could they be going about with
him  even following him  and i could see that faramir did not like the place he
was taking them to any more than you do  what is wrong ’
‘i cannot answer that now ’ said gandalf  ‘yet my heart guessed that
frodo and gollum would meet before the end  for good  or for evil  but of cirith
ungol i will not speak tonight  treachery  treachery i fear  treachery of that
miserable creature  but so it must be  let us remember that a traitor may betray
himself and do good that he does not intend  it can be so  sometimes  good
night  ‘
the next day came with a morning like a brown dusk  and the hearts of men 
lifted for a while by the return of faramir  sank low again  the winged shadows
were not seen again that day  yet ever and anon  high above the city  a faint
cry would come  and many who heard it would stand stricken with a passing dread 
while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept 
and now faramir was gone again  ‘they give him no rest ’ some murmured 
‘the lord drives his son too hard  and now he must do the duty of two  for
himself and for the one that will not return ’ and ever men looked northward 
asking  ‘where are the riders of rohan ’
in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing  but the lord of the city was
master of his council  and he was in no mood that day to bow to others  early in
the morning the council had been summoned  there all the captains judged that
because of the threat in the south their force was too weak to make any stroke
of war on their own part  unless perchance the riders of rohan yet should come 
meanwhile they must man the walls and wait 
‘yet ’ said denethor  ‘we should not lightly abandon the outer
defences  the rammas made with so great a labour  and the enemy must pay dearly
for the crossing of the river  that he cannot do  in force to assail the city 
either north of cair andros because of the marshes  or southwards towards
lebennin because of the breadth of the river  that needs many boats  it is at
osgiliath that he will put his weight  as before when boromir denied him the
passage ’
‘that was but a trial ’ said faramir  ‘today we may make the enemy pay
ten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange  for he can afford to
lose a host better than we to lose a company  and the retreat of those that we
put out far afield will be perilous  if he wins across in force ’
‘and what of cair andros ’ said the prince  ‘that  too  must be held 
if osgiliath is defended  let us not forget the danger on our left  the rohirrim
may come  and they may not  but faramir has told us of great strength drawing
ever to the black gate  more than one host may issue from it  and strike for
more than one passage ’
‘much must be risked in war ’ said denethor  ‘cair andros is manned and
no more can be sent so far  but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do his
lord’s will ’
then all were silent  but at length faramir said  ‘i do not oppose your
will  sire  since you are robbed of boromir  i will go and do what i can in his
stead - if you command it ’
‘i do so ’ said denethor 
‘then farewell ’ said faramir  ‘but if i should return  think better of
me ’
‘that depends on the manner of your return ’ said denethor 
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east  ‘do not throw
your live away rashly or in bitterness ’ he said  ‘you will be needed here 
for other things than war  your father loves you  faramir  and will remember it
ere the end  farewell ’
so now the lord faramir had gone forth again  and had taken with him such
strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared  on the walls some
gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city  and they wondered what chanced
there  for nothing could be seen  and others  as
ever  looked north and counted the leagues to théoden in rohan  ‘will
he come  will he remember our old alliance ’ they said 
‘yes  he will come ’ said gandalf  ‘even if he comes too late  but
think  at best the red arrow cannot have reached him more than two days ago  and
the miles are long from edoras ’
it was night again ere news came  a man rode in haste from the fords  saying
that a host had issued from minas morgul and was already drawing nigh to
osgiliath  and it had been joined by regiments from the south  haradrim  cruel
and tall  ‘and we have learned ‘ said the messenger  ‘that the black
captain leads them once again  and the fear of him has passed before him over
the river ’
with those ill-boding words the third day closed since pippin came to minas
tirith  few went to rest  for small hope had any now that even faramir could
hold the fords for long 
the next day  though the darkness had reached its full and grew no deeper  it
weighed heavier on men’s hearts  and a great dread was on them  ill news came
soon again  the passage of anduin was won by the enemy  faramir was retreating
to the wall of the pelennor  rallying his men to the causeway forts  but he was
ten times outnumbered 
‘if he wins back at all across the pelennor  his enemies will be on his
heels ’ said the messenger  ‘they have paid dear for the crossing but less
dearly than we hoped  the plan has been well laid  it is now seen that in secret
they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in east
osgiliath  they swarmed across like beetles  but it is the black captain that
defeats us  few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming  his own folk
quail at him  and they would slay themselves at his bidding ’
‘then i am needed there more than here ’ said gandalf  and rode off at
once  and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight  and all that night pippin
alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward 
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again  a mockery in the unlightened
dark  when far away he saw fires spring up  across in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood  the watchmen cried aloud  and all men in the city
stood to arms  now ever and anon there was a red flash  and slowly through the
heavy air dull rumbles could be heard 
‘they have taken the wall ’ men cried  ‘they are blasting breaches in
it  they are coming ’
‘where is faramir ’ cried beregond in dismay  ‘say not that he has
fallen ’
it was gandalf that brought the first tidings  with a handful of horsemen he
came in the middle morning  riding as escort to a line of wains  they were
filled with wounded men  all that could be saved from the wreck of the causeway
forts  at once he went to denethor  the lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side  and through
the dim windows  north and south and east  he bent his dark eyes  as if to
pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round  most to the north he looked 
and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might
hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away 
‘is faramir come ’ he asked 
‘no ’ said gandalf  ‘but he still lived when i left him  yet he is
resolved to stay with the rearguard  lest the retreat over the pelennor become a
rout  he may  perhaps  hold his men together long enough  but i doubt it  he is
pitted against a foe too great  for one has come that i feared ’
‘not - the dark lord ’ cried pippin  forgetting his place in his terror 
denethor laughed bitterly  ‘nay  not yet  master peregrin  he will not come
save only to triumph over me when all is won  he uses others as his weapons  so
do all great lords  if they are wise  master halfling  or why should i sit here
in my tower and think  and watch  and wait  spending even my sons  for i can
still wield a brand ’
he stood up and cast open his long black cloak  and behold  he was clad in
mail beneath  and girt with a long sword  great-hilted in a sheath of black and
silver  ‘thus have i walked  and thus now for many years have i slept ’ he
said  ‘lest with age the body should grow soft and timid ’
‘yet now under the lord of barad-dûr the most fell of all his
captains is already master of your outer walls ’ said gandalf  ‘king of
angmar long ago  sorcerer  ringwraith  lord of the nazgûl  a spear of
terror in the hand of sauron  shadow of despair ’
‘then  mithrandir  you had a foe to match you ’ said denethor  ‘for
myself  i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark
tower  is this all that you have returned to say  or can it be that you have
withdrawn because you are overmatched ’
pippin trembled  fearing that gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath  but his
fear was needless  ‘it might be so ’ gandalf answered softly  ‘but our
trial of strength is not yet come  and if words spoken of old be true  not by
the hand of man shall he fall  and hidden from the wise is the doom that awaits
him  however that may be  the captain of despair does not press forward  yet  he
rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just spoken  from the rear 
driving his slaves in madness on before 
‘nay  i came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed  for the
rammas is breached far and wide  and soon the host of morgul will enter in at
many points  and i came chiefly to say this  soon there will be battle on the
fields  a sortie must be made ready  let it be of mounted men  in them lies our
brief hope  for in one thing only is the enemy still poorly provided  he has few
horsemen ’
‘and we also have few  now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of
time ’ said denethor 
‘we are likely to see other newcomers first ’ said gandalf  ‘fugitives
from cair andros have already reached us  the isle has fallen  another army is
come from the black gate  crossing from the north-east ’
‘some have accused you  mithrandir  of delighting to bear ill news ’ said
denethor  ‘but to me this is no longer news  it was known to mw ere nightfall
yesterday  as for the sortie  i had already given thought to it  let us go
down ’
time passed  at length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of the
out-companies  small bands of weary and often wounded men came first with little
order  some were running wildly as if pursued  away to the eastward the distant
fires flickered  and now it seemed that here and there they crept across the
plain  houses and barns were burning  then from many points little rivers of red
flame came hurrying on  winding through the gloom  converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the city-gate to osgiliath 
‘the enemy ’ men murmured  ‘the dike is down  here they come pouring
through the breaches  and they carry torches  it seems  where are our own
folk ’
it drew now to evening by the hour  and the light was so dim that even
far-sighted men upon the citadel could discern little clearly out upon the
fields  save only the burnings that ever multiplied  and the lines of fire that
grew in length and speed  at last  less than a mile from the city  a more
ordered mass of men came into view  marching not running  still holding
together 
the watchers held their breath  ‘faramir must be there ’ they said  ‘he
can govern man and beast  he will make it yet ’
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant  out of the gloom
behind a small company of horsemen galloped  all that was left of the rearguard 
once again they turned at bay  facing the oncoming lines of fire  then suddenly
there was a tumult of fierce cries  horsemen of the enemy swept up  the lines of
fire became flowing torrents  file upon file of
orcs bearing flames  and wild southron men with red banners  shouting with harsh
tongues  surging up  overtaking the retreat  and with a piercing cry out of the
dim sky fell the winged shadows  the nazgûl stooping to the kill 
the retreat became a rout  already men were breaking away  flying wild and
witless here and there  flinging away their weapons  crying out in fear  falling
to the ground 
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel  and denethor at last released the
sortie  drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under the looming walls
outside they had waited for his signal  all the mounted men that were left in
the city  now they sprang forward  formed  quickened to a gallop  and charged
with a great shout  and from the walls an answering shout went up  for foremost
on the field rode the swan-knights of dol amroth with their prince and his blue
banner at their head 
‘amroth for gondor ’ they cried  ‘amroth to faramir ’
like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat  but
one rider outran them all  swift as the wind in the grass  shadowfax bore him 
shining  unveiled once more  a light starting from his upraised hand 
the nazgûl screeched and swept away  for their captain was not yet come
to challenge the white fire of his foe  the hosts of morgul intent on
their prey  taken at unawares in wild career  broke  scattering like sparks in a
gale  the out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers 
hunters became the hunted  the retreat became an onslaught  the field was strewn
with stricken orcs and men  and a reek arose of torches cast away  sputtering
out in swirling smoke  the cavalry rode on 
but denethor did not permit them to go far  though the enemy was checked  and
for the moment driven back  great forces were flowing in from the east  again
the trumpet rang  sounding the retreat  the cavalry of gondor halted  behind
their screen the out-companies re-formed  now steadily they came marching back 
they reached the gate of the city and entered  stepping proudly  and proudly the
people of the city looked on them and cried their praise  and yet they were
troubled in heart  for the companies were grievously reduced  faramir had lost a
third of his men  and where was he 
last of all he came  his men passed in  the mounted knights returned  and at
their rear the banner of dol amroth  and the prince  and in his arms before him
on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman  faramir son of denethor  found
upon the stricken field 
‘faramir  faramir ’ men cried  weeping in
the streets  but he did not answer  and they bore him away up the winding road
to the citadel and his father  even as the nazgûl had swerved aside from
the onset of the white rider  there came flying a deadly dart  and faramir  as
he held at bay a mounted champion of harad  had fallen to the earth  only
the charge of dol amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would
have hewed him as he lay 
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower  and he said  your son
has returned  lord  after great deeds  and he told all that he had seen  but
denethor rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent  then he bade
them make a bed in the chamber and lay faramir upon it and depart  but he
himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit of the tower  and
many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleamed and
flickered from the narrow windows for a while  and then flashed and went out 
and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and sat beside him without
speaking  but the face of the lord was grey  more deathlike than his son’s 
so now at last the city was besieged  enclosed in a ring of foes  the rammas
was broken  and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy  the last word to come
from outside the walls was brought by men flying
down the northward road ere the gate was shut  they were the remnant of the
guard that was kept at that point where the way from anórien and rohan
ran into the townlands  ingold led them  the same who had admitted gandalf
and pippin less than five days before  while the sun still rose and there was
hope in the morning 
‘there is no news of the rohirrim ’ he said  ‘rohan will not come now 
or if they come  it will not avail us  the new host that we had tidings of has
come first  from over the river by way of andros  it is said  they are strong 
battalions of orcs of the eye  and countless companies of men of a new sort that
we have not met before  not tall  but broad and grim  bearded like dwarves 
wielding great axes  out of some savage land in the
wide east they come  we deem  they hold the northward road  and many have passed
on into anórien  the rohirrim cannot come ’
the gate was shut  all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of the
enemy that roamed outside  burning field and tree  and hewing any man that they
found abroad  living or dead  the numbers that had already passed over the river
could not be guessed in the darkness  but when morning  or its dim shadow  stole
over the plain  it was seen that even fear by night had scarcely over-counted
them  the plain was dark with their marching companies  and as far as eyes could
strain in the mirk there sprouted  like a foul fungus-growth  all about the
beleaguered city great camps of tents  black or sombre red 
busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging  digging lines of deep trenches in a
huge ring  just out of bowshot from the walls  and as the trenches were made
each was filled with fire  though how it was kindled or fed  by art or devilry 
none could see  all day the labour went forward  while the men of minas tirith
looked on  unable to hinder it  and as each length of trench was completed  they
could see great wains approaching  and soon yet more companies of the enemy were
swiftly setting up  each behind the cover of a trench  great engines for the
casting of missiles  there were none upon the city walls large enough to reach
so far or to stay the work 
at first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices  for the main wall
of the city was of great height and marvellous
thickness  built ere the power and craft of númenor waned in exile  and
its outward face was like to the tower of orthanc  hard and dark and smooth 
unconquerable by steel or fire  unbreakable except by some convulsion that would
rend the very earth on which it stood 
‘nay ’ they said  ‘not if the nameless one himself should come  not
even he could enter here while we yet live ’ but some answered  ‘while we
yet live  how long  he has a weapon that has brought low many strong places
since the world began  hunger  the roads are cut  rohan will not come ’
but the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall  it was no
brigand or orc-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the lord of mordor’s
greatest foe  a power and mind of malice guided it  as soon as the great
catapults were set  with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch  they
began to throw missiles marvellously high  so that they passed right above the
battlement and fell thudding within the first circle of the city  and many of
them by some secret art burst into flame as they came toppling down 
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall  and all who could be
spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places  then among
the greater casts there fell another hail  less ruinous but more horrible  all
about the streets and lanes behind the gate it tumbled down  small round shot
that did not burn  but when men ran to learn what it might be  they cried aloud
or wept  for the enemy was flinging into the city all the heads of those who had
fallen fighting at osgiliath  or on the rammas  or in the fields  they were grim
to look on  for though some were crushed and shapeless  and some had been
cruelly hewn  yet many had features that could be told  and it seemed that they
had died in pain  and all were branded with the foul token of the lidless eye 
but marred and dishonoured as they were  it often chanced that thus a man would
see again the face of someone that he had known  who had walked proudly once in
arms  or tilled the fields  or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vales in
the hills 
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before the
gate  curses they heeded not  nor understood the tongues of western men  crying
with harsh voices like beasts and carrion-birds  but soon there were few left in
minas tirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor  for yet
another weapon  swifter than hunger  the lord of the dark tower had  dread and
despair 
the nazgûl came again  and as their dark lord now grew and put
forth his strength  so their voices  which uttered only his will and his malice 
were filled with evil and horror  ever they circled above the city  like
vultures that expect their fill of doomed men’s flesh  out of sight and shot
they flew  and yet were ever present  and their deadly voices rent the air  more
unbearable they became  not less  at each new cry  at length even the
stout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace passed
over them  or they would stand  letting their weapons fall from nerveless hands
while into their minds a blackness came  and they thought no more of war  but
only of hiding and of crawling  and of death 
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed in the chamber of the
white tower  wandering in a desperate fever  dying someone said  and soon
‘dying’ all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets  and by him
his father sat  and said nothing  but watched  and gave no longer any heed to
the defence 
no hours so dark had pippin known  not even in the clutches of the uruk-hai 
it was his duty to wait upon the lord  and wait he did  forgotten it seemed 
standing by the door of the unlit chamber  mastering his own fears as best he
could  and as he watched  it seemed to him that denethor grew old before his
eyes  as if something had snapped in his proud will  and his stern mind was
overthrown  grief maybe had wrought it  and remorse  he saw tears on that once
tearless face  more unbearable than wrath 
‘do not weep  lord ’ he stammered  ‘perhaps he will get well  have you
asked gandalf ’
‘comfort me not with wizards ’ said denethor  ‘the fool’s hope has
failed  the enemy has found it  and now his power waxes  he sees our very
thoughts  and all we do is ruinous 
‘i sent my son forth  unthanked  unblessed  out into needless peril  and
here he lies with poison in his veins  nay  nay  whatever may now betide in war 
my line too is ending  even the house of the stewards has failed  mean folk
shall rule the last remnant of the kings of men  lurking in the hills until all
are hounded out ’
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city  ‘nay  i will not come
down ’ he said  ‘i must stay beside my son  he might still speak before the
end  but that is near  follow whom you will  even the grey fool  though his hope
has failed  here i stay ’
so it was that gandalf took command of the last defence of the city of
gondor  wherever he came men’s hearts would lift again  and the winged shadows
pass from memory  tirelessly he strode from citadel
to gate  from north to south about the wall  and with him went the prince of dol
amroth in his shining mail  for he and his knights still held themselves like
lords in whom the race of númenor ran true  men that saw them whispered
saying  ‘belike the old tales speak well  there is elvish blood in the
veins of that folk  for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long
ago ’ and then one would sing amid the gloom some staves of the lay of
nimrodel  or other songs of the vale of anduin out of vanished years 
and yet - when they had gone  the shadows closed on men again  and their
hearts went cold  and the valour of gondor withered into ash  and so slowly they
passed out of a dim day of fears into the darkness of a desperate night  fires
now raged unchecked in the first circle of the city  and the garrison upon the
outer wall was already in many places cut off from retreat  but the faithful who
remained there at their posts were few  most had fled beyond the second gate 
far behind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged  and all day more
force and gear of war had poured across  now at last in the middle night the
assault was loosed  the vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by many
devious paths that had been left between them  on they came  reckless of their
loss as they approached  still bunched and herded  within the range of bowmen on
the wall  but indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage 
though the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of such skill as
gondor once had boasted  then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beaten down  the hidden captain put forth his strength  slowly the great
siege-towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark 
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower  and pippin let them
enter  for they were urgent  denethor turned his head slowly from faramir’s
face  and looked at them silently 
‘the first circle of the city is burning  lord ’ they said  ‘what are
your commands  you are still the lord and steward  not all will follow
mithrandir  men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned ’
‘why  why do the fools fly ’ said denethor  ‘better to burn sooner than
late  for burn we must  go back to your bonfire  and i  i will go now to my
pyre  to my pyre  no tomb for denethor and faramir  no tomb  no long slow sleep
of death embalmed  we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed
hither from the west  the west has failed  go back and burn ’
the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled 
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of faramir that he had
held  ‘he is burning  already burning ’ he said sadly  ‘the house of his
spirit crumbles ’ then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him 
‘farewell ’ he said  ‘farewell  peregrin son of paladin  your service
has been short  and now it is drawing to an end  i release you from the little
that remains  go now  and die in what way seems best to you  and with whom you
will  even that friend whose folly brought you to this death  send for my
servants and then go  farewell ’
‘i will not say farewell  my lord ’ said pippin kneeling  and then
suddenly hobbit-like once more  he stood up and looked the old man in the eyes 
‘i will take your leave  sir ’ he said  ‘for i want to see gandalf very
much indeed  but he is no fool  and i will not think of dying until he despairs
of life  but from my word and your service i do not wish to be released while
you live  and if they come at last to the citadel  i hope to be here and stand
beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me ’
‘do as you will  master halfling ’ said denethor  ‘but my life is
broken  send for my servants ’ he turned back to faramir 
pippin left him and called for the servants  and they came  six men of the
household  strong and fair  yet they trembled at the summons  but in a quiet
voice denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramir’s bed and take it up 
and they did so  and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber  slowly
they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be  and denethor  now
bending on a staff  followed them  and last came pippin 
out from the white tower they walked  as if to a funeral  out into the
darkness  where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull red 
softly they paced the great courtyard  and at a word from denethor halted beside
the withered tree 
all was silent  save for the rumour of war in the city down below  and they
heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool  then
they went on through the citadel gate  where the sentinel stared at them in
wonder and dismay as they passed by  turning westward they came at length to a
door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle  fen hollen it was called  for it
was kept ever shut save at times of funeral  and only the lord of the city might
use that way  or those who bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of
the dead  beyond it went a winding road that descended in many curves down to
the narrow land under the shadow of mindolluin’s precipice where stood the
mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards 
a porter sat in a little house beside the way  and with fear in his eyes he
came forth bearing a lantern in his hand  at the lord’s command he unlocked
the door  and silently it swung back  and they passed through  taking the
lantern from his hand  it was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many-pillared balusters looming in the swaying lantern-beam  their slow feet
echoed as they walked down  down  until at last they came to the silent street 
rath dínen  between pale domes and empty halls and images of men long
dead  and they entered into the house of the stewards and set down their burden 
there pippin  staring uneasily about him  saw that he was in a wide vaulted
chamber  draped as it were with the great shadows that the little lantern threw
upon its shrouded walls  and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables  carved
of marble  and upon each table lay a sleeping form  hands folded  head pillowed
upon stone  but one table near at hand stood broad and bare  upon it at a sign
from denethor they laid faramir and his father side by side  and covered them
with one covering  and stood then with bowed heads as mourners beside a bed of
death  then denethor spoke in a low voice 
‘here we will wait ’ he said  ‘but send not for the embalmers  bring us
wood quick to burn  and lay it all about us  and beneath  and pour oil upon it 
and when i bid you thrust in a torch  do this and speak no more to me 
farewell ’
‘by your leave  lord ’ said pippin and turned and fled in terror from the
deathly house  ‘poor faramir ’ he thought  ‘i must find gandalf  poor
faramir  quite likely he needs medicine more than tears  oh  where can i find
gandalf  in the thick of things  i suppose  and he will have no time to spare
for dying men or madmen ’
at the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard there 
‘your master is not himself ’ he said  ‘go slow  bring no fire to this
place while faramir lives  do nothing until gandalf comes ’
‘who is the master of minas tirith ’ the man answered  ‘the lord
denethor or the grey wanderer ’
‘the grey wanderer or no one  it would seem ’ said pippin  and he sped
back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him  past the
astonished porter  out through the door  and on  till he came near the gate of
the citadel  the sentinel hailed him as he went by  and he recognized the voice
of beregond 
‘whither do you run  master peregrin ’ he cried 
‘to find mithrandir ’ pippin answered 
‘the lord’s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me ’ said
beregond  ‘but tell me quickly  if you may  what goes forward  whither has my
lord gone  i have just come on duty  but i heard that he passed towards the
closed door  and men were bearing faramir before him ’
‘yes ’ said pippin  ‘to the silent street ’
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears  ‘they said that he was dying ’
he sighed  ‘and now he is dead ’
‘no ’ said pippin  ‘not yet  and even now his death might be prevented 
i think  but the lord of the city  beregond  has fallen before his city is
taken  he is fey and dangerous ’ quickly he told of denethor’s strange words
and deeds  ‘i must find gandalf at once ’
‘then you must go down to the battle ’
‘i know  the lord has given me leave  but  beregond  if you can  do
something to stop any dreadful thing happening ’
‘the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave
their post for any cause  save at his own command ’
‘well  you must choose between orders and the life of faramir ’ said
pippin  ‘and as for orders  i think you have a madman to deal with  not a
lord  i must run  i will return if i can ’
he ran on  down  down towards the outer city  men flying back from the
burning passed him  and some seeing his livery turned and shouted  but he paid
no heed  at last he was through the second gate  beyond which great fires leaped
up between the walls  yet it seemed strangely silent  no noise or shouts of
battle or din of arms could be heard  then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and
a great shock  and a deep echoing boom  forcing himself on against a gust of
fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees  pippin turned a corner
opening on the wide place behind the city gate  he stopped dead  he had found
gandalf  but he shrank back  cowering into a shadow 
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on  the drums rolled 
to the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy pressed to the
walls  there came great beasts  like moving houses in the red and fitful light 
the mûmakil of the harad
dragging through the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines  yet their
captain cared not greatly what they did or how many might be slain  their
purpose was only to test the strength of the defence and to keep the men of
gondor busy in many places  it was against the gate that he would throw his
heaviest weight  very strong it might be  wrought of steel and iron  and guarded
with towers and bastions of indomitable stone  yet it was the key  the weakest
point in all that high and impenetrable wall 
the drums rolled louder  fires leaped up  great engines crawled across the
field  and in the midst was a huge ram  great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in
length  swinging on mighty chains  long had it been forging in the dark smithies
of mordor  and its hideous head  founded of black steel  was shaped in the
likeness of a ravening wolf  on it spells of ruin lay  grond they named it  in
memory of the hammer of the underworld of old  great beasts drew it  orcs
surrounded it  and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it 
but about the gate resistance still was stout  and there the knights of dol
amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay  shot and dart fell thick 
siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches  all before the walls on
either side of the gate the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of the
slain  yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up 
grond crawled on  upon its housing no fire would catch  and though now and
again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping ruin
among the orcs innumerable that guarded it  their bodies were cast aside from
its path and others took their place 
grond crawled on  the drums rolled wildly  over the hills of slain a hideous
shape appeared  a horseman  tall  hooded  cloaked in black  slowly  trampling
the fallen  he rode forth  heeding no longer any dart  he halted and held up a
long pale sword  and as he did so a great fear fell on all  defender and foe
alike  and the hands of men drooped to their sides  and no bow sang  for a
moment all was still 
the drums rolled and rattled  with a vast rush grond was hurled forward by
huge hands  it reached the gate  it swung  a deep boom rumbled through the city
like thunder running in the clouds  but the doors of iron and posts of steel
withstood the stroke 
then the black captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful
voice  speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both
heart and stone 
thrice he cried  thrice the great ram boomed  and suddenly upon the last
stroke the gate of gondor broke  as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst
asunder  there was a flash of searing lightning  and the doors tumbled in riven
fragments to the ground 
in rode the lord of the nazgûl  a great black shape against the fires
beyond he loomed up  grown to a vast menace of despair  in rode the lord of the
nazgûl  under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed  and
all fled before his face 
all save one  there waiting  silent and still in the space before the gate 
sat gandalf upon shadowfax  shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the
earth endured the terror  unmoving  steadfast as a graven image in
rath dínen 
‘you cannot enter here ’ said gandalf  and the huge shadow halted  ‘go
back to the abyss prepared for you  go back  fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master  go ’
the black rider flung back his hood  and behold  he had a kingly crown  and
yet upon no head visible was it set  the red fires shone between it and the
mantled shoulders vast and dark  from a mouth unseen there came a deadly
laughter 
‘old fool ’ he said  ‘old fool  this is my hour  do you not know death
when you see it  die now and curse in vain ’ and with that he lifted high his
sword and flames ran down the blade 
gandalf did not move  and in that very moment  away behind in some courtyard
of the city  a cock crowed  shrill and clear he crowed  recking nothing of
wizardry or war  welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the
shadows of death was coming with the dawn 
and as if in answer there came from far away another note  horns  horns 
horns  in dark mindolluin’s sides they dimly echoed  great horns of the north
wildly blowing  rohan had come at last 
 
it was dark and merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled in a
blanket  yet though the night was airless and windless  all about him hidden
trees were sighing softly  he lifted his head  then he heard it again  a sound
like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain-steps  the throb would cease
suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point  now nearer  now further
off  he wondered if the watchmen had heard it 
he could not see them  but he knew that all round him were the companies of
the rohirrim  he could smell the horses in the dark  and could hear their
shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground  the host was
bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about
eilenach beacon  a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the drúadan
forest that lay beside the great road in east anórien 
tired as he was merry could not sleep  he had ridden now for four days on
end  and the ever-deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart  he began to
wonder why he had been so eager to come  when he had been given every excuse 
even his lord’s command  to stay behind  he wondered  too  if the old king
knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry  perhaps not  there seemed to be
some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelm  the marshal who commanded the éored
in which they were riding  he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not to
hear if he spoke  he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was
carrying  dernhelm was no comfort  he never spoke to anyone  merry felt small 
unwanted  and lonely  now the time was anxious  and the host was in peril  they
were less than a day’s ride from the out-walls of minas tirith that encircled
the townlands  scouts had been sent ahead  some had not returned  others
hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them  a host
of the enemy was encamped upon it  three miles west of amon dîn  and some
strength of men was already thrusting along the road and was no more than three
leagues away  orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside  the
king and éomer held council in the watches of the night 
merry wanted somebody to talk to  and he thought of pippin  but
that only increased his restlessness  poor pippin  shut up in the great city of
stone  lonely and afraid  merry wished he was a tall rider like éomer and
could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue  he sat up 
listening to the drums that were beating again  now nearer at hand 
presently he heard voices speaking low  and he saw dim half-shrouded lanterns
passing through the trees  men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark 
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him  cursing the tree-roots  he
recognized the voice of the marshal  elfhelm 
‘i am not a tree-root  sir ’ he said  ‘nor a bag  but a bruised hobbit 
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot ’
‘anything that can keep so in this devil’s mirk ’ answered elfhelm 
‘but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness  orders may
come for a sudden move ’
‘is the enemy coming then ’ asked merry anxiously  ‘are those their
drums  i began to think i was imagining them  as no one else seemed to take any
notice of them ’
‘nay  nay ’ said elfhelm  ‘the enemy is on the road not in the hills 
you hear the woses  the wild men of the woods  thus they talk together from
afar  they still haunt drúadan forest  it is said  remnants of an older
time they be  living few and secretly  wild and wary as the beasts  they
go not to war with gondor or the mark  but now they are troubled by the darkness
and the coming of the orcs  they fear lest the dark years be returning  as seems
likely enough  let us be thankful that they are not
hunting us  for they use poisoned arrows  it is said  and they are woodcrafty
beyond compare  but they have offered their services to théoden  even now
one of their headmen is being taken to the king  yonder go the lights  so much i
have heard but no more  and now i must busy myself with my lord’s
commands  pack yourself up  master bag ’ he vanished into the shadows 
merry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts  but quite apart
from that a great weight of dread was on him  waiting was unbearable  he longed
to know what was going to happen  he got up and soon was walking warily in
pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees 
presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up for the
king under a great tree  a large lantern  covered
above  was hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below  there sat
théoden and éomer  and before them on the ground sat a strange
squat shape of a man  gnarled as an old stone  and the hairs of his scanty beard
straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss  he was short-legged and fat-armed 
thick and stumpy  and clad only with grass about his waist  merry felt that he
had seen him before somewhere  and suddenly he remembered the púkel-men
of dunharrow  here was one of those old images brought to life  or maybe
a creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used by
the forgotten craftsmen long ago 
there was a silence as merry crept nearer  and then the wild man began to
speak  in answer to some question  it seemed  his voice was deep and guttural 
yet to merry’s surprise he spoke the common speech  though in a halting
fashion  and uncouth words were mingled with it 
‘no  father of horse-men ’ he said  ‘we fight not  hunt only  kill gorgûn
in woods  hate orc-folk  you hate gorgûn
too  we help as we can  wild men have long ears and long eyes  know all paths 
wild men live here before stone-houses  before tall men come up out of water ’
‘but our need is for aid in battle ’ said éomer  ‘how will
you and your folk help us ’
‘bring news ’ said the wild man  ‘we look out from hills  we climb big
mountain and look down  stone-city is shut  fire burns there outside  now inside
too  you wish to come there  then you must be quick  but gorgûn
and men out of far-away ’ he waved a short gnarled arm eastward  ‘sit on
horse-road  very many  more than horse-men ’
‘how do you know that ’ said éomer 
the old man’s flat face and dark eyes showed nothing  but his voice was
sullen with displeasure  ‘wild men are wild 
free  but not children ’ he answered  ‘i am great headman  ghân-buri-ghân 
i count many things  stars in sky  leaves on trees  men in the dark  you have a
score of scores counted ten times and five  they have more  big fight  and who
will win  and many more walk round walls of stone-houses ’
‘alas  he speaks all too shrewdly ’ said théoden  ‘and our
scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road  we cannot
sweep them away in sudden onset ’
‘and yet we need great haste ’ said éomer  ‘mundburg is
on fire ’
‘let ghân-buri-ghân finish ’ said the wild man  ‘more than
one road he knows  he will lead you by road where no pits are  no gorgûn
walk  only wild men and beasts  many paths were made when stonehouse-folk were
stronger  they carved hills as hunters carve
beast-flesh  wild men think they ate stone for food  they went through drúadan
to rimmon with great wains  they go no longer  road is forgotten  but not by
wild men  over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass and tree  there
behind rimmon and down to dîn  and back at the end to horse-men’s road 
wild men will show you that road  then you will kill gorgûn
and drive away bad dark with bright iron  and wild men can go back to sleep in
the wild woods ’
éomer and the king spoke together in their own tongue  at length théoden
turned to the wild man  ‘we will receive your offer ’ he said  ‘for though
we leave a host of foes behind  what matter  if the stone-city falls  then we
shall have no returning  if it is saved  then the orc-host itself will be cut
off  if you are faithful  ghân-buri-ghân  then we will give you rich
reward  and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever ’
‘dead men are not friends to living men  and give them no gifts ’ said
the wild man  ‘but if you live after the
darkness  then leave wild men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like
beasts any more  ghân-buri-ghân will not lead you into trap  he will
go himself with father of horse-men  and if he leads you wrong  you will kill
him ’
‘so be it ’ said théoden 
‘how long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road ’
asked éomer  ‘we must go at foot-pace  if you guide us  and i doubt not
the way is narrow ’
‘wild men go quick on feet ’ said ghân  ‘way is wide for four
horses in stonewain valley yonder ’ he waved his hand southwards  ‘but
narrow at beginning and at end  wild man could walk from here to dîn
between sunrise and noon ’
‘then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders ’ said éomer 
‘but we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all  things unforeseen
may hinder us  and if our host is all strung out  it will be long ere it can be
set in order when we issue from the hills  what is the hour now ’
‘who knows ’ said théoden  ‘all is night now ’
‘it is all dark  but it is not all night ’
said ghân  ‘when sun comes we feel her  even when she is hidden  already
she climbs over east-mountains  it is the opening of day in the sky-fields ’
‘then we must set out as soon as may be ’ said éomer  ‘even so
we cannot hope to come to gondor’s aid today ’
merry waited to hear no more  but slipped away to get ready for the summons
to the march  this was the last stage before the battle  it did not seem likely
to him that many of them would survive it  but he thought of pippin and the
flames in minas tirith and thrust down his own dread 
all went well that day  and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting
to waylay them  the wild men had put out a screen of wary hunters  so that no
orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the
hills  the light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered
city  and the riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses 
each company was guided by a wild woodman  but old ghân walked beside the
king  the start had been slower than was hoped  for it had taken time for
the riders  walking and leading their horses  to find paths over the thickly
wooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valley  it
was late in the afternoon when the leaders came to
wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of amon dîn  and
masking a great gap in the line of hills that from nardol to dîn ran east
and west  through the gap the forgotten wain-road long ago had run down  back
into the main horse-way from the city through anórien  but now for many
lives of men trees had had their way with it  and it had vanished  broken and
buried under the leaves of uncounted years  but the thickets offered to the
riders their last hope of cover before they went into open battle  for
beyond them lay the road and the plains of anduin  while east and southwards the
slopes were bare and rocky  as the writhen hills gathered themselves together
and climbed up  bastion upon bastion  into the great mass and shoulders of
mindolluin 
the leading company was halted  and as those behind filed up out of the
trough of the stonewain valley they spread out and passed to camping-places
under the grey trees  the king summoned the captains to council  éomer
sent out scouts to spy upon the road  but old ghân shook his head 
‘no good to send horse-men ’ he said  ‘wild men have already seen all
that can be seen in the bad air  they will come soon and speak to me here ’
the captains came  and then out of the trees crept warily other púkel-shapes
so like old ghân that merry could hardly tell them apart  they spoke to ghân
in a strange throaty language 
presently ghân turned to the king  ‘wild men say many things ‘ he
said  ‘first  be wary  still many men in camp beyond dîn  an hour’s
walk yonder ’ he waved his arm west towards the black beacon  ‘but
none to see between here and stone-folk’s new walls  many busy there  walls
stand up no longer  gorgûn
knock them down with earth-thunder and with clubs of black iron  they are unwary
and do not look about them  they think their
friends watch all roads ’ at that old ghân made a curious gurgling
noise  and it seemed that he was laughing 
‘good tidings ’ cried éomer  ‘even in this gloom hope gleams
again  our enemy’s devices oft serve us in his despite  the accursed
darkness itself has been a cloak to us  and now  lusting to destroy gondor and
throw it down stone from stone  his orcs have taken away my greatest fear  the
out-wall could have been held long against us  now we can sweep through - if
once we win so far ’
‘once again i thank you  ghân-buri-ghân of the woods ’ said
théoden  ‘good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance ’
‘kill gorgûn 
kill orc-folk  no other words please wild men ‘ answered ghân  ‘drive
away bad air and darkness with bright iron ’
‘to do these things we have ridden far ’ said the king  ‘and we shall
attempt them  but what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show ’
ghân-buri-ghân squatted down and touched the earth with his horny
brow in token of farewell  then he got up as if to depart  but suddenly
he stood looking up like some startled woodland animal snuffling a strange air 
a light came in his eyes 
‘wind is changing ’ he cried  and with that  in a twinkling as it seemed 
he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms  never to be seen by any rider
of rohan again  not long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbed again 
yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the wild men were unfaithful 
strange and unlovely though they might appear 
‘we need no further guidance ’ said elfhelm  ‘for there are riders in
the host who have ridden down to mundburg in days of peace  i for one  when we
come to the road it will veer south  and there will lie before us still seven
leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands  along most of that way there is
much grass on either side of the road  on that stretch the errand-riders of
gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed  we may ride it swiftly and without
great rumour ’
‘then since we must look for fell deeds and the need
of all our strength ’ said éomer  ‘i counsel that we rest now  and
set out hence by night  and so time our going that we come upon the fields when
tomorrow is as light as it will be  or when our lord gives the signal ’
to this the king assented  and the captains departed  but soon elfhelm
returned  ‘the scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey wood 
lord ’ he said  ‘save two men only  two dead men and two dead horses ’
‘well ’ said éomer  ‘what of it ’
‘this  lord  they were errand-riders of gondor  hirgon was one maybe  at
least his hand still clasped the red arrow  but his head was hewn off  and this
also  it would seem by the signs that they were fleeing westward when
they fell  as i read it  they found the enemy already on the out-wall  or
assailing it  when they returned - and that would be two nights ago  if they
used fresh horses from the posts  as is their wont  they could not reach the
city and turned back ’
‘alas ’ said théoden  ‘then denethor has heard no news of our
riding and will despair of our coming ’
‘need brooks no delay  yet late is better than never ’
said éomer  ‘and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer
than ever before since men spoke with mouth ’
it was night  on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving
silently  now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward 
far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the black sky and
the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it  they were drawing near
the rammas of the pelennor  but the day was not yet come 
the king rode in the midst of the leading company  his household-men about
him  elfhelm’s éored came
next  and now merry noticed that dernhelm had left his place and in the darkness
was moving steadily forward  until at last he was riding just in rear of the
king’s guard  there came a check  merry heard voices in front speaking softly 
out-riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall  they came
to the king 
‘there are great fires  lord ’ said one  ‘the city is all set about
with flame  and the field is full of foes  but all seem drawn off to the
assault  as well as we could guess  there are few left upon the out-wall  and
they are heedless  busy in destruction ’
‘do you remember the wild man’s words 
lord ’ said another  ‘i live upon the open wold in days of peace  wídfara
is my name  and to me also the air brings messages  already the wind is turning 
there comes a breath out of the south  there is a sea-tang in it  faint though
it be  the morning will bring new things  above the reek it will be dawn
when you pass the wall ’
‘if you speak truly  wídfara  then may you live beyond this day in
years of blessedness ’ said théoden  he turned to the men of his
household who were near  and he spoke now in a clear voice so that many
also of the riders of the first éored
heard him 
‘now is the hour come  riders of the mark  sons of eorl  foes and fire are
before you  and your homes far behind  yet  though you fight upon an alien
field  the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever  oaths ye have
taken  now fulfil them all  to lord and land and league of friendship ’
men clashed spear upon shield 
‘éomer  my son  you lead the first éored ’ said théoden 
‘and it shall go behind the king’s banner in the centre  elfhelm 
lead your company to the right when we pass the wall  and grimbold shall lead
his towards the left  let the other companies behind follow these three that
lead  as they have chance  strike wherever the enemy gathers  other plans we
cannot make  for we know not yet how things stand upon the field  forth now  and
fear no darkness ’
the leading company rode off as swiftly as they could  for it was still deep
dark  whatever change wídfara might forebode  merry was riding behind
dernhelm  clutching with the left hand while with the other he tried to
loosen his sword in its sheath  he felt now bitterly the truth of the old
king’s words  in such a battle what would you do meriadoc  just
this ’ he thought  ‘encumber a rider  and hope at best to stay in my seat
and not be pounded to death by galloping hoofs ’
it was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood  they soon
reached them  too soon for merry  wild cries broke out  and there was some clash
of arms  but it was brief  the orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed 
and they were quickly slain or driven off  before the ruin of the north-gate in
the rammas the king halted again  the first éored
drew up behind him and about him on either side  dernhelm kept close to the
king  though elfhelm’s company was away on the right  grimbold’s men turned
aside and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward 
merry peered from behind dernhelm’s back  far away  maybe ten miles or
more  there was a great burning  but between it and the riders lines of fire
blazed in a vast crescent  at the nearest point less than a league distant  he
could make out little more on the dark plain  and as yet he neither saw any hope
of morning  nor felt any wind  changed or unchanged 
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the field of gondor 
pouring in slowly but steadily  like the rising tide through breaches in a dike
that men have thought secure  but the mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city  and as yet no tidings came to him warning that
his designs held any flaw 
after a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward  to come between
the fires of the siege and the outer fields  still they were unchallenged  and
still théoden gave no signal  at last he halted once again  the
city was now nearer  a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of
death  the horses were uneasy  but the king sat upon snowmane  motionless 
gazing upon the agony of minas tirith  as if stricken suddenly by anguish  or
by dread  he seemed to shrink down  cowed by age  merry himself felt as if a
great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him  his heart beat slowly  time
seemed poised in uncertainty  they were too late  too late was worse than never 
perhaps théoden would quail  bow his old head  turn  slink away to
hide in the hills 
then suddenly merry felt it at last  beyond doubt  a change  wind was in his
face  light was glimmering  far  far away  in the south the clouds could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapes  rolling up  drifting  morning lay beyond them 
but at that same moment there was a flash  as if lightning had sprung from
the earth beneath the city  for a searing second it stood dazzling far off in
black and white  its topmost tower like a glittering needle  and then as the
darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom 
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect  tall and
proud he seemed again  and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice  more
clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before 
arise  arise  riders of théoden 

fell deeds awake  fire and slaughter 

spear shall be shaken  shield be splintered 

a sword-day  a red day  ere the sun rises 

ride now  ride now  ride to gondor 
with that he seized a great horn from guthláf
his banner-bearer  and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder  and
straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music  and the blowing
of the horns of rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a
thunder in the mountains 
ride now  ride now  ride to gondor 
suddenly the king cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away  behind him his
banner blew in the wind  white horse upon a field of green  but he outpaced it 
after him thundered the knights of his house  but
he was ever before them  éomer rode there  the white horsetail on his
helm floating in his speed  and the front of the first éored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore  but théoden could not be
overtaken  fey he seemed  or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new tire in
his veins  and he was borne up on snowmane like a god of old  even as oromë
the great in the battle of the valar when the world was young  his golden shield
was uncovered  and lo  it shone like an image of the sun  and the grass
flamed into green about the white feet of his steed  for morning came  morning
and a wind from the sea  and the darkness was removed  and the hosts of mordor
wailed  and terror took them  and they fled  and died  and the hoofs of wrath
rode over them  and then all the host of rohan burst into song  and they sang as
they slew  for the joy of battle was on them  and the sound of their singing
that was fair and terrible came even to the city 
 
but it was no orc-chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor  the
darkness was breaking too soon  before the date that his master had set for it 
fortune had betrayed him for the moment  and the world had turned against him 
victory was slipping from his grasp even as he
stretched out his hand to seize it  but his arm was long  he was still in
command  wielding great powers  king  ringwraith  lord of the nazgûl  he
had many weapons  he left the gate and vanished 
théoden king of the mark had reached the road from the gate to
the river  and he turned towards the city that was now less than a mile distant 
he slackened his speed a little  seeking new foes  and his knights came about
him  and dernhelm was with them  ahead nearer the walls elfhelm’s men were
among the siege-engines  hewing  slaying  driving their foes into the fire-pits 
well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was overrun  and there camps
were blazing  orcs were flying towards the river like herds before the hunters 
and the rohirrim went hither and thither at their will  but they had not yet
overthrown the siege  nor won the gate  many foes stood before it  and on the
further half of the plain were other hosts still unfought  southward beyond the
road lay the main force of the haradrim  and there their horsemen were gathered
about the standard of their chieftain  and he looked out  and in the growing
light he saw the banner of the king  and that it was far ahead of the battle
with few men about it  then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted aloud 
and displaying his standard  black serpent upon scarlet  he came against the
white horse and the green with great press of men  and the drawing of the
scimitars of the southrons was like a glitter of stars 
then théoden was aware of him  and would not wait for his
onset  but crying to snowmane he charged headlong to greet him  great was the
clash of their meeting  but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter 
and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter 
fewer were they but they clove through the southrons like a fire-bolt in a
forest  right through the press drove théoden thengel’s son  and his
spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain  out swept his sword  and he
spurred to the standard  hewed staff and bearer  and the black serpent
foundered  then all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far
away 
but lo  suddenly in the midst of the glory of the king his golden shield was
dimmed  the new morning was blotted from the sky  dark fell about him  horses
reared and screamed  men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground 
‘to me  to me ’ cried théoden  ‘up eorlingas  fear no
darkness ’ but snowmane wild with terror stood up on high  fighting with the
air  and then with a great scream he crashed upon his side  a black dart
had pierced him  the king fell beneath him 
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud  and behold  it was a winged
creature  if bird  then greater than all other birds  and it was naked  and
neither quill nor feather did it bear  and its vast pinions were as webs of hide
between horned fingers  and it stank  a creature of an older world maybe it was 
whose kind  fingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the moon  outstayed
their day  and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood  apt to evil  and
the dark lord took it  and nursed it with fell meats  until it grew beyond the
measure of all other things that fly  and he gave it to his servant to be his
steed  down  down it came  and then  folding its fingered webs  it gave a
croaking cry  and settled upon the body of snowmane  digging in its claws 
stooping its long naked neck 
upon it sat a shape  black-mantled  huge and threatening  a crown of steel he
bore  but between rim and robe naught was there to
see  save only a deadly gleam of eyes  the lord of the nazgûl  to the air
he had returned  summoning his steed ere the darkness failed  and now he was
come again  bringing ruin  turning hope to despair  and victory to death  a
great black mace he wielded 
but théoden was not utterly forsaken  the knights of his house lay
slain about him  or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far
away  yet one stood there still  dernhelm the young  faithful beyond fear  and
he wept  for he had loved his lord as a father  right through the charge
merry had been borne unharmed behind him  until the shadow came  and then
windfola had thrown them in his terror  and now ran wild upon the plain  merry
crawled on all fours like a dazed beast  and such a horror was on him that he
was blind and sick 
‘king’s man  king’s man ’ his heart cried within him  ‘you must
stay by him  as a father you shall be to me  you said ’ but his will made no
answer  and his body shook  he dared not open his eyes or look up 
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard dernhelm
speaking  yet now the voice seemed strange  recalling some other voice that he
had known 
‘begone  foul dwimmerlaik  lord of carrion  leave the dead in peace ’
a cold voice answered  ‘come not between the
nazgûl and his prey  or he will not slay thee in thy turn  he will bear
thee away to the houses of lamentation  beyond all darkness  where thy flesh
shall be devoured  and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye ’
a sword rang as it was drawn  ‘do what you will  but i will hinder it  if i
may ’
‘hinder me  thou fool  no living man may hinder me ’
then merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest  it seemed that
dernhelm laughed  and the clear voice was like the ring
of steel  ‘but no living man am i  you look upon a woman  éowyn i am 
éomund’s daughter  you stand between me and my lord and kin  begone  if
you be not deathless  for living or dark undead  i will smite you  if you touch
him ’
the winged creature screamed at her  but the ringwraith made no answer  and
was silent  as if in sudden doubt  very amazement for a moment conquered
merry’s fear  he opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them  there
some paces from him sat the great beast  and all seemed
dark about it  and above it loomed the nazgûl lord like a shadow of
despair  a little to the left facing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm 
but the helm of her secrecy  had fallen from her  and her bright hair  released
from its bonds  gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders  her eyes grey
as the sea were hard and fell  and yet tears were on her cheek  a sword was in
her hand  and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy’s eyes 
éowyn it was  and dernhelm also  for into merry’s mind
flashed the memory of the face that he saw at the riding from dunharrow  the
face of one that goes seeking death  having no hope  pity filled his heart and
great wonder  and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke  he
clenched his hand  she should not die  so fair  so desperate at least she should
not die alone  unaided 
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him  but still he hardly dared
to move  dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him  slowly  slowly he
began to crawl aside  but the black captain  in doubt and malice intent upon the
woman before him  heeded him no more than a worm in the mud 
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings  and the wind of them was
foul  again it leaped into the air  and then swiftly fell
down upon éowyn  shrieking  striking with beak and claw 
still she did not blench  maiden of the rohirrim  child of kings  slender but
as a steel-blade  fair but terrible  a swift stroke she dealt  skilled and
deadly  the outstretched neck she clove asunder  and the hewn head fell like a
stone  backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin  vast wings
outspread  crumpled on the earth  and with its fall the shadow passed away  a
light fell about her  and her hair shone in the sunrise 
out of the wreck rose the black rider  tall and threatening  towering above
her  with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let fall his
mace  her shield was shivered in many pieces  and her arm was broken  she
stumbled to her knees  he bent over her like a cloud  and his eyes glittered  he
raised his mace to kill 
but suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain  and his
stroke went wide  driving into the ground  merry’s sword had stabbed him from
behind  shearing through the black mantle  and passing up beneath the hauberk
had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee 
‘éowyn  éowyn ’ cried merry  then tottering  struggling up 
with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle  as the
great shoulders bowed before her  the sword broke sparkling into many shards 
the crown rolled away with a clang  éowyn fell forward upon her fallen
foe  but lo  the mantle and hauberk were empty  shapeless they lay now on the
ground  torn and tumbled  and a cry went up into the shuddering air  and
faded to a shrill wailing  passing with the wind  a voice bodiless and thin that
died  and was swallowed up  and was never heard again in that age of this world 
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain  blinking like
an owl in the daylight  for tears blinded him  and
through a mist he looked on éowyn’s fair head  as she lay and did not
move  and he looked on the face of the king  fallen in the midst of his glory 
for snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again  yet he was the
bane of his master 
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it  and lo  théoden
opened his eyes  and they were clear  and he spoke in a quiet voice though
laboured 
‘farewell  master holbytla ’ he said  ‘my body is broken  i go to my
fathers  and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed  i felled
the black serpent  a grim morn  and a glad day  and a golden sunset ’
merry could not speak  but wept anew  ‘forgive me  lord ’ he said at
last  ‘if i broke your command  and yet have done no more in your service than
to weep at our parting ’
the old king smiled  ‘grieve not  it is forgiven  great heart will not be
denied  live now in blessedness  and when you sit in peace with your pipe  think
of me  for never now shall i sit with you in
meduseld  as i promised  or listen to your herb-lore ’ he closed his eyes  and
merry bowed beside him  presently he spoke again  ‘where is éomer  for
my eyes darken  and i would see him ere i go  he must be king after me  and i
would send word to éowyn  she  she would not have me leave her 
and now i shall not see her again  dearer than daughter ’
‘lord  lord ’ began merry brokenly  ‘she is-‘  but at that moment
there was a great clamour  and all about them horns and trumpets were blowing 
merry looked round  he had forgotten the war  and all the world beside  and many
hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall  though in truth it was only a
little while  but now he saw that they were in danger of being caught in the
very midst of the great battle that would soon be joined 
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the river  and from
under the walls came the legions of morgul  and from the southward fields came
footmen of harad with horsemen before them  and behind them rose the huge backs
of the mûmakil
with war-towers upon them  but northward the white crest of éomer led the
great front of the rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshalled  and out
of the city came all the strength of men that was in it  and the silver swan of
dol amroth was borne in the van  driving the enemy from the gate 
for a moment the thought flitted through merry’s mind  ‘where is gandalf 
is he not here  could he not have saved the king and éowyn ’ but
thereupon éomer rode up in haste  and with him came the knights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses  they looked in
wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there  and their steeds would
not go near  but éomer leaped from the saddle  and grief and dismay fell
upon him as he came to the king’s side and stood there in silence 
then one of the knights took the king’s banner from the hand of guthláf
the banner-bearer who lay dead  and he lifted it up  slowly théoden
opened his eyes  seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to
éomer 
‘hail  king of the mark ’ he said  ‘ride now to victory  bid éowyn
farewell ’ and so he died  and knew not that éowyn lay near him  and
those who stood by wept  crying  ‘théoden king  théoden king ’
but éomer said to them 
mourn not overmuch  mighty was the fallen 

meet was his ending  when his mound is raised 

women then shall weep  war now calls us 
yet he himself wept as he spoke  ‘let his knights remain here ’ he said 
‘and bear his body in honour from the field  lest the battle ride
over it  yea  and all these other of the king’s men that lie here ’ and he
looked at the slain  recalling their names  then suddenly he beheld his sister
éowyn as she lay  and he knew her  he stood a moment as a man who is
pierced in the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart  and then his
face went deathly white  and a cold fury rose in him  so that all speech failed
him for a while  a fey mood took him 
‘éowyn  éowyn ’ he cried at last  ‘éowyn  how come
you here  what madness or devilry is this  death  death  death  death
take us all ’
then without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the
city  he spurred headlong back to the front of the great host  and blew a horn 
and cried aloud for the onset  over the field rang his clear voice calling 
‘death  ride  ride to ruin and the world’s ending ’
and with that the host began to move  but the rohirrim sang no more  death
they cried with one voice loud and terrible  and gathering speed like a great
tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed  roaring away
southwards 
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears and no
one spoke to him  indeed none seemed to heed him  he brushed away the tears  and
stooped to pick up the green shield that éowyn had given him  and
he slung it at his back  then he looked for his sword that he had let fall  for
even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed  and now he could only use his
left hand  and behold  there lay his weapon  but the blade was smoking like a
dry branch that has been thrust in a fire  and as he watched it  it writhed and
withered and was consumed 
so passed the sword of the barrow-downs  work of westernesse  but glad would
he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the north-kingdom
when the dúnedain were young  and chief among their foes was the dread
realm of angmar and its sorcerer king  no other blade  not though mightier hands
had wielded it  would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter  cleaving the undead
flesh  breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will 
men now raised the king  and laying cloaks upon spear-truncheons they made
shift to bear him away towards the city  and others lifted éowyn gently
up and bore her after him  but the men of the king’s household they could not
yet bring from the field  for seven of the king’s knights had fallen there 
and déorwine their chief was among them  so they laid them apart from
their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them  and afterwards when all
was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of the
beast  but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which was
carved in the tongues of gondor and the mark 
faithful servant yet master’s bane

lightfoot’s foal  swift snowmane 
green and long grew the grass on snowmane’s howe  but ever black and bare
was the ground where the beast was burned 
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers  and he gave no more
heed to the battle  he was weary and full of pain  and his limbs trembled
as with a chill  a great rain came out of the sea  and it seemed that all things
wept for théoden and éowyn  quenching the fires in the city with
grey tears  it was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of
gondor approaching  imrahil  prince of dol amroth  rode up and drew rein
before them 
‘what burden do you bear  men of rohan ’ he cried 
‘théoden king ’ they answered  ‘he is dead  but éomer
king now rides in the battle  he with the white crest in the wind ’
then the prince went from his horse  and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his great onset  and he wept  and rising
he looked then on éowyn and was amazed  ‘surely  here is a woman ’ he
said  ‘have even the women of the rohirrim come to war in our need ’
‘nay  one only ’ they answered  ‘the lady
éowyn is she  sister of éomer  and we knew naught of her riding
until this hour  and greatly we rue it ’
then the prince seeing her beauty  though her face was pale and cold  touched
her hand as he bent to look more closely on her  ‘men of rohan ’ he cried 
‘are there no leeches among you  she is hurt to the death maybe  but i deem
that she yet lives ’ and he held the bright-burnished vambrace that was upon
his arm before her cold tips  and behold  a little mist was laid on it hardly to
be seen 
‘haste now is needed ’ he said  and he sent one riding back swiftly to
the city to bring aid  but he bowing low to the fallen  bade them farewell  and
mounting rode away into battle 
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of the pelennor  and the din
of arms rose upon high  with the crying of men and the neighing of horses  horns
were blown and trumpets were braying  and the mûmakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to war  under the south walls of the city the
footmen of gondor now drove against the legions of
morgul that were still gathered there in strength  but the horsemen rode
eastward to the succour of éomer  húrin the tall warden of the
keys  and the lord of lossarnach  and hirluin of the green hills  and prince
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him 
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim  for fortune had turned against
éomer  and his fury had betrayed him  the great wrath of his onset had
utterly overthrown the front of his enemies  and great wedges of his riders
had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons  discomfiting their horsemen
and riding their footmen to ruin  but wherever the mûmakil
came there the horses would not go  but blenched and swerved away  and the great
monsters were unfought  and stood like towers of defence  and the haradrim
rallied about them  and if the rohirrim at their onset were thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alone  soon their case became worse  for new strength came now
streaming to the field out of osgiliath  there they had been mustered for the
sack of the city and the rape of gondor  waiting on the call of their captain 
he now was destroyed  but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul had flung them into
the fray  easterlings with axes  and variags of khand  southrons in scarlet  and
out of far harad black men like half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues 
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim  others held westward to hold off the
forces of gondor and prevent their joining with rohan 
it was even as the day thus began to turn against gondor and their hope
wavered that a new cry went up in the city  it being then midmorning  and a
great wind blowing  and the rain flying north  and the sun shining  in that
clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear  and their last
hope left them 
for anduin  from the bend at the harlond  so flowed that from the city men
could look down it lengthwise for some leagues  and the far-sighted could see
any ships that approached  and looking thither they cried in dismay  for black
against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on the wind 
dromunds  and ships of great draught with many oars  and with black sails
bellying in the breeze 
‘the corsairs of umbar ’ men shouted  ‘the corsairs of umbar  look  the
corsairs of umbar are coming  so belfalas is taken  and the ethir  and lebennin
is gone  the corsairs are upon us  it is the last stroke of doom ’
and some without order  for none could he found to command them in the city 
ran to the bells and tolled the alarm  and some blew the trumpets sounding the
retreat  ‘back to the walls ’ they cried  ‘back to the walls  come back to
the city before all are overwhelmed ’ but the wind that sped the ships blew
all their clamour away 
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm 
all too well they could see for themselves the black sails  for éomer was
now scarcely a mile from the harlond  and a great press of his first foes was
between him and the haven there  while new foes came swirling behind  cutting
him off from the prince  now he looked to the river  and hope died in his
heart  and the wind that he had blessed he now called accursed  but the hosts of
mordor were enheartened  and filled with a new lust and fury they came yelling
to the onset 
stern now was éomer’s mood  and his mind clear again  he let
blow the horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither  for he
thought to make a great shield-wall at the last  and stand  and fight there on
foot till all fell  and do deeds of song on the fields of pelennor  though no
man should be left in the west to remember the last king of the mark  so he rode
to a green hillock and there set his banner  and the white horse ran rippling in
the wind 
out of doubt  out of dark to the day’s rising

i came singing in the sun  sword unsheathing 

to hope’s end i rode and to heart’s breaking 

now for wrath  now for ruin and a red nightfall 
these staves he spoke  yet he laughed as he said them  for once more lust of
battle was on him  and he was still unscathed  and he was young  and he was
king  the lord of a fell people  and lo  even as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on the black ships  and he lifted up his sword to defy them 
and then wonder took him  and a great joy  and he cast his sword up in the
sunlight and sang as he caught it  and all eyes followed his gaze  and behold 
upon the foremost ship a great standard broke  and the wind displayed it as she
turned towards the harlond  there flowered a white tree  and that was for
gondor  but seven stars were about it  and a high crown above it  the signs of
elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count  and the stars flamed in
the sunlight  for they were wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond  and the
crown was bright in the morning  for it was wrought of mithril and gold 
thus came aragorn son of arathorn  elessar  isildur’s heir  out of the
paths of the dead  borne upon a wind from the sea to the kingdom of gondor  and
the mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords 
and the joy and wonder of the city was a music of trumpets and a ringing of
bells  but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewilderment  and a great
wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled with their
foes  and a black dread fell on them  knowing that the tides of fate had turned
against them and their doom was at hand 
east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy before them  troll-men
and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight  south strode éomer and men
fled before his face  and they were caught between the hammer and the
anvil  for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the harlond and swept
north like a storm  there came legolas  and gimli wielding his axe  and halbarad
with the standard  and elladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow  and the dour-handed dúnedain  rangers of the north  leading a
great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and the fiefs of the south  but
before all went aragorn with the flame of the west  andúril like a new
fire kindled  narsil re-forged as deadly as of old  and upon his brow was
the star of elendil 
and so at length éomer and aragorn met in the midst of the battle  and
they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad 
‘thus we meet again  though all the hosts of mordor lay between us ’ said
aragorn  ‘did i not say so at the hornburg ’
‘so you spoke ’ said éomer  ‘but hope oft deceives  and i knew
not then that you were a man foresighted  yet twice blessed is help unlooked
for  and never was a meeting of friends more joyful ’ and they clasped hand in
hand  ‘nor indeed more timely ’ said éomer  ‘you come none too
soon  my friend  much loss and sorrow has befallen us ’
‘then let us avenge it  ere we speak of it ’ said aragorn  and they rode
back to battle together 
hard fighting and long labour they had still  for the southrons were bold men
and grim  and fierce in despair  and the easterlings were strong and
war-hardened and asked for no quarter  and so in this place and that  by burned
homestead or barn  upon hillock or mound  under wall or on field  still they
gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away 
then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled all the sky with a
great burning  so that the hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood  fire
glowed in the river  and the grass of the pelennor lay red in the nightfall  and
in that hour the great battle of the field of gondor was over  and not one
living foe was left within the circuit of the rammas  all were slain save those
who fled to die  or to drown in the red foam of the river  few ever came
eastward to morgul or mordor  and to the land of the haradrim came only a tale
from far off  a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor 
aragorn and éomer and imrahil rode back towards the gate of the city 
and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow  these three were unscathed  for
such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms  and few indeed had
dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath  but many
others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field  the axes hewed forlong as he
fought alone and unhorsed  and both duilin of morthond and his brother were
trampled to death when they assailed the mûmakil 
leading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters  neither hirluin
the fair would return to pinnath gelin  nor grimbold to grimslade  nor halbarad
to the northlands  dour-handed ranger  no few had fallen  renowned or nameless 
captain or soldier  for it was a great battle and the full count of it no tale
has told  so long afterward a maker in rohan said in his song of the mounds of
mundburg 
we heard of the horns in the hills ringing 

the swords shining in the south-kingdom 

steeds went striding to the stoningland

as wind in the morning  war was kindled 

there théoden fell  thengling mighty 

to his golden halls and green pastures

in the northern fields never returning 

high lord of the host  harding and guthláf

dúnhere and déorwine  doughty grimbold 

herefara and herubrand  horn and fastred 

fought and fell there in a far country 

in the mounds of mundburg under mould they lie

with their league-fellows  lords of gondor 

neither hirluin the fair to the hills by the sea 

nor forlong the old to the flowering vales

ever  to arnach  to his own country

returned in triumph  nor the tall bowmen 

derufin and duilin  to their dark waters 

meres of morthond under mountain-shadows 

death in the morning and at day’s ending

lords took and lowly  long now they sleep

under grass in gondor by the great river 

grey now as tears  gleaming silver 

red then it rolled  roaring water 

foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset 

as beacons mountains burned at evening 

red fell the dew in rammas echor 
 
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless  but
pippin rose to his feet  as if a great weight had been lifted from him  and he
stood listening to the horns  and it seemed to him that they would break his
heart with joy  and never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the
distance without tears starting in his eyes  but now suddenly his errand
returned to his memory  and he ran forward  at that moment gandalf stirred and
spoke to shadowfax  and was about to ride through the gate 
‘gandalf  gandalf  ‘ cried pippin  and shadowfax halted 
‘what are you doing here ’ said gandalf  ‘is it not a law in the city
that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the citadel  unless their
lord gives them leave ’
‘he has ’ said pippin  ‘he sent me away  but i am frightened  something
terrible may happen up there  the lord is out of his mind  i think  i am afraid
he will kill himself  and kill faramir too  can’t you do something ’
gandalf looked through the gaping gate  and already on the fields he heard
the gathering sound of battle  he clenched his hand  ‘i must go ‘ he said 
‘the black rider is abroad  and he will yet bring ruin on us  i have no
time ’
‘but faramir ’ cried pippin  ‘he is not dead  and they will burn him
alive  if someone does not stop them ’
‘burn him alive ’ said gandalf  ‘what is this tale  be quick ’
‘denethor has gone to the tombs ’ said pippin  ‘and he has taken
faramir  and he says we are all to burn  and he will not wait  and they are to
make a pyre and burn him on it  and faramir as well  and he has sent men to
fetch wood and oil  and i have told beregond  but i’m afraid he won’t dare
to leave his post  he is on guard  and what can he do anyway ’ so pippin
poured out his tale  reaching up and touching gandalf’s knee with trembling
hands  ‘can’t you save faramir ’
‘maybe i can ’ said gandalf  ‘but if i do  then others will die  i
fear  well  i must come  since no other help can reach him  but evil and sorrow
will come of this  even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to
strike us  for his will it is that is at work ’
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly  and catching up pippin and
setting him before him  he turned shadowfax with a word  up the climbing streets
of minas tirith they clattered  while the noise of war rose behind them 
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread  seizing their weapons 
crying one to another  ‘rohan has come ’ captains were shouting  companies
were mustering  many already were marching down to the gate 
they met the prince imrahil  and he called to them  ‘whither now 
mithrandir  the rohirrim are fighting on the fields of gondor  we must gather
all the strength that we can find ’
‘you will need every man and more ’ said gandalf  ‘make all haste  i
will come when i can  but i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not
wait  take command in the lord’s absence ’
they passed on  and as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they felt
the wind blowing in their faces  and they caught the glimmer of morning far
away  a light growing in the southern sky  but it brought little hope to them 
not knowing what evil lay before them  fearing to come too late 
‘darkness is passing ’ said gandalf  ‘but it still lies heavy on this
city ’
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard  ‘then beregond has gone ’
said pippin more hopefully  they turned away and hastened along the road to the
closed door  it stood wide open  and the porter lay before it  he was slain and
his key had been taken 
‘work of the enemy ’ said gandalf  ‘such deeds he loves  friend at war
with friend  loyalty divided in confusion of hearts ’ now he dismounted and
bade shadowfax return to his stable  ‘for  my friend ’ he said  ‘you and i
should have ridden to the fields long ago  but other matters delay me  yet come
swiftly if i call ’
they passed the door and walked on down the steep winding road  light was
growing  and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went slowly by
like grey ghosts 
suddenly the silence was broken  and they heard below them cries and the
ringing of swords  such sounds as had not been
heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city  at last they came
to rath dínen and hastened towards the house of the stewards  looming in
the twilight under its great dome 
‘stay  stay ’ cried gandalf  springing forward to the stone stair before
the door  ‘stay this madness ’
for there were the servants of denethor with swords and torches in their
hands  but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond  clad in the
black and silver of the guard  and he held the door against them  two of them
had already fallen to his sword  staining the hallows with their blood  and the
others cursed him  calling him outlaw and traitor to his master 
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward  they heard from within the house of
the dead the voice of denethor crying  ‘haste  haste  do as i have bidden 
slay me this renegade  or must i do so myself ’ thereupon the door which
beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open  and there behind him
stood the lord of the city  tall and fell  a light like flame was in his eyes 
and he held a drawn sword 
but gandalf sprang up the steps  and the men fell back from him and covered
their eyes  for his coming was like the incoming of a white light into a dark
place  and he came with great anger  he lifted up his hand  and in the very
stroke  the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp and fell behind him in
the shadows of the house  and denethor stepped backward before gandalf as one
amazed 
‘what is this  my lord ’ said the wizard 
‘the houses of the dead are no places for the living  and why do men fight
here in the hallows when there is war enough before the gate  or has our enemy
come even to rath dínen ’
‘since when has the lord of gondor been answerable to thee ’ said
denethor  ‘or may i not command my own servants ’
‘you may ’ said gandalf  ‘but others may contest your will  when it is
turned to madness and evil  where is your son  faramir ’
‘he lies within ’ said denethor  ‘burning  already burning  they have
set a fire in his flesh  but soon all shall be burned  the west has failed  it
shall all go up in a great fire  and all shall be ended  ash  ash and smoke
blown away on the wind ’
then gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already
done some evil deed  and he thrust forward  with beregond and pippin behind him 
while denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within  but there they
found faramir  still dreaming in his fever  lying upon the table  wood was piled
under it  and high all about it  and all was drenched with oil  even the
garments of faramir and the coverlets  but as yet no fire had been set to the
fuel  then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him  even as the light
of his power was hidden under his grey mantle  he leaped up on to the faggots 
and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again  and bore him towards the
door  but as he did so faramir moaned and called on his father in his dream 
denethor started as one waking from a trance  and the flame died in his eyes 
and he wept  and he said  ‘do not take my son from me  he calls for me ’
‘he calls ’ said gandalf  ‘but you cannot come to him yet  for he must
seek healing on the threshold of death  and maybe find it not  whereas your part
is to go out to the battle of your city  where maybe death awaits you  this you
know in your heart ’
‘he will not wake again ’ said denethor  ‘battle is vain  why should we
wish to live longer  why should we not go to death side by side ’
‘authority is not given to you  steward of gondor  to order the hour of
your death ’ answered gandalf  ‘and only the heathen kings  under the
domination of the dark power  did thus  slaying themselves in pride and despair 
murdering their kin to ease their own death ’ then passing through the door he
took faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on which he had been
brought  and which had now been set in the porch  denethor followed him  and
stood trembling  looking with longing on the face of his son  and for a moment 
while all were silent and still  watching the lord in his throes  he wavered 
‘come ’ said gandalf  ‘we are needed  there is much that you can yet
do ’
then suddenly denethor laughed  he stood up tall and proud again  and
stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his
head had lain  then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering  and lo  he
had between his hands a palantír 
and as he held it up  it seemed to those that looked on that the globe began to
glow with an inner flame  so that the lean face of the lord was lit as with a
red fire  and it seemed cut out of hard stone  sharp with black shadows  noble 
proud  and terrible  his eyes glittered 
‘pride and despair ’ he cried  ‘didst thou think that the eyes of the
white tower were blind  nay  i have seen more than thou knowest  grey fool  for
thy hope is but ignorance  go then and labour in healing  go forth and fight 
vanity  for a little space you may triumph on the field  for a day  but against
the power that now arises there is no victory  to this city only the first
finger of its hand has yet been stretched  all the east is moving  and even now
the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up anduin a fleet with black sails 
the west has failed  it is time for all to depart who would not be slaves ’
‘such counsels will make the enemy’s victory certain indeed ’ said
gandalf 
‘hope on then ’ laughed denethor  ‘do i not know thee  mithrandir  thy
hope is to rule in my stead  to stand behind every throne  north  south  or
west  i have read thy mind and its policies  do i not know that you commanded
this halfling here to keep silence  that you brought him hither to be a spy
within my very chamber  and yet in our speech together i have learned the names
and purpose of all thy companions  so  with the left hand thou wouldst use me
for a little while as a shield against mordor  and with the right bring up this
ranger of the north to supplant me 
‘but i say to thee  gandalf mithrandir  i will not be thy tool  i am
steward of the house of anárion  i will not step down to be the
dotard chamberlain of an upstart  even were his claim proved to me  still he
comes but of the line of isildur  i will not bow to such a one  last of a ragged
house long bereft of lordship and dignity ’
‘what then would you have ’ said gandalf  ‘if your will could have its
way ’
‘i would have things as they were in all the days of my life ’ answered
denethor  ‘and in the days of my longfathers before me  to be the lord of this
city in peace  and leave my chair to a son after me  who would be his own master
and no wizard’s pupil  but if doom denies this to me  then i will have naught 
neither life diminished  nor love halved  nor honour abated ’
‘to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully surrenders his
charge is diminished in love or in honour ’ said gandalf  ‘and at the least
you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt ’
at those words denethor’s eyes flamed again  and taking the stone under his
arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier  but beregond sprang forward and
set himself before faramir 
‘so ’ cried denethor  ‘thou hadst already stolen half my son’s love 
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also  so that they rob me wholly of
my son at the last  but in this at least thou shalt not defy my will  to rule my
own end ’
‘come hither ’ he cried to his servants  ‘come  if you are not all
recreant ’ then two of them ran up the steps to him  swiftly he snatched a
torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house  before gandalf could
hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel  and at once it crackled and roared
into flame 
then denethor leaped upon the table  and standing there wreathed in fire and
smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it
on his knee  casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on the
table  clasping the palantír
with both hands upon his breast  and it was said that ever after  if any man
looked in that stone  unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other
purpose  he saw only two aged hands withering in flame 
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door  for a
while he stood in thought  silent upon the threshold  while those outside heard
the greedy roaring of the fire within  and then denethor gave a great cry  and
afterwards spoke no more  nor was ever again seen by mortal men 
‘so passes denethor  son of ecthelion ’ said gandalf  then he turned to
beregond and the lord’s servants that stood there aghast  ‘and so pass also
the days of gondor that you have known  for good or evil they are ended  ill
deeds have been done here  but let now all enmity that lies between you be put
away  for it was contrived by the enemy and works his will  you have been caught
in a net of warring duties that you did not weave  but think  you servants of
the lord  blind in your obedience  that but for the treason of beregond faramir 
captain of the white tower  would now also be burned 
‘bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen  and we
will bear faramir  steward of gondor  to a place where he can sleep in peace  or
die if that be his doom ’
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the houses
of healing  while behind them walked pippin with downcast
head  but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of
the dead  and even as gandalf came to the end of rath dínen there was a
great noise  looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue
forth  and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of
fire  but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins  then
in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf 
at length they came back to the steward’s door  and beregond looked with
grief at the porter  ‘this deed i shall ever rue ’ he said  ‘but a madness
of haste was on me  and he would not listen  but drew sword against me ’ then
taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed the door and
locked it  ‘this should now be given to the lord faramir ’ he said 
‘the prince of dol amroth is in command in the absence of the lord ’ said
gandalf  ‘but since he is not here  i must take this on myself  i bid you keep
the key and guard it  until the city is set in order again ’
now at last they passed into the high circles of the city  and in the light
of morning they went their way towards the houses of healing  and these were
fair houses set apart  for the care of those who were grievously sick  but now
they were prepared for the tending of men hurt in battle or dying  they stood
not far from the citadel-gate  in the sixth circle  nigh to its southward wall 
and about them was a garden and a greensward with trees  the only such place in
the city  there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to remain in minas
tirith  since they were skilled in healing or in the service of the healers 
but even as gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier to the main
door of the houses  they heard a great cry that went up from the field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed  and died away on
the wind  so terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still  and yet
when it had passed  suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the east  and it seemed to them
that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds 
but gandalf’s face was grave and sad  and bidding beregond and pippin to
take faramir into the houses of healing  he went up
on to the walls nearby  and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out  and he beheld with the sight that was given to him all
that had befallen  and when éomer rode out from the forefront of his
battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field  he sighed  and he
cast his cloak about him again  and went from the walls  and beregond and pippin
found him standing in thought before the door of the houses when they came out 
they looked at him  and for a while he was silent  at last he spoke  ‘my
friends ’ he said  ‘and all you people of this city and of the western
lands  things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass  shall we weep or be
glad  beyond hope the captain of our foes has been destroyed  and you have heard
the echo of his last despair  but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss 
and that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor  so long has the
reach of our enemy become  alas  but now i perceive how his will was able to
enter into the very heart of the city 
‘though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves 
long ago i guessed that here in the white tower  one at least of the seven
seeing stones was preserved  in the days of his wisdom denethor did not presume
to use it  nor to challenge sauron  knowing the limits of his own strength  but
his wisdom failed  and i fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in
the stone and was deceived  far too often  i guess  since boromir departed  he
was too great to be subdued to the will of the dark power  he saw nonetheless
only those things which that power permitted him to see  the knowledge which he
obtained was  doubtless  often of service to him  yet the vision of the great
might of mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it
overthrew his mind ’
‘now i understand what seemed so strange to me ’ said pippin shuddering
at his memories as he spoke  ‘the lord went away from the room where faramir
lay  and it was only when he returned that i first thought he was changed  old
and broken ’
‘it was in the very hour that faramir was brought to the tower that many of
us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber ’ said beregond  ‘but we have
seen that light before  and it has long been rumoured in the city  that the lord
would at times wrestle in thought with his enemy ’
‘alas  then i have guessed rightly ’ said gandalf  ‘thus the will of
sauron entered into minas tirith  and thus i have been delayed here  and here i
shall still be forced to remain  for i shall soon have other charges  not
faramir only 
‘now i must go down to meet those who come  i have seen a sight upon the
field that is very grievous to my heart  and greater sorrow may yet come to
pass  come with me  pippin  but you  beregond  should return to the citadel and
tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen  it will be his duty  i
fear  to withdraw you from the guard  but say to him that  if i may give him
counsel  you should be sent to the houses of healing  to be the guard and
servant of your captain  and to be at his side when he awakes - if that shall
ever be again  for by you he was saved from the fire  go now  i shall return
soon ’
with that he turned away and went with pippin down towards the lower city 
and even as they hastened on their way the wind brought a grey rain  and all the
fires sank  and there arose a great smoke before them 
 
a mist was in merry’s eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near the
ruined gate of minas tirith  he gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that
lay about all  fire and smoke and stench was in the air  for many engines had
been burned or cast into the fire-pits  and many of the slain also  while here
and there lay many carcases of the great southron monsters  half-burned  or
broken by stone-cast  or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of
morthond  the flying rain had ceased for a time  and the sun gleamed up above 
but all the lower city was still wrapped in a smouldering reek 
already men were labouring to clear a way
through the jetsam of battle  and now out from the gate came some bearing
litters  gently they laid éowyn upon soft pillows  but the king’s body
they covered with a great cloth of gold  and they bore torches about him  and
their flames  pale in the sunlight  were fluttered by the wind 
so théoden and éowyn came to the city of gondor  and all who
saw them bared their heads and bowed  and they passed through the ash and fume
of the burned circle  and went on and up along the streets of stone  to
merry the ascent seemed agelong  a meaningless journey in a hateful dream  going
on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize 
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out  and
he was walking in a darkness  and he thought  ‘this is a tunnel leading to a
tomb  there we shall stay forever ’ but suddenly into his dream there fell a
living voice 
‘well  merry  thank goodness i have found you ’
he looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little  there was pippin 
they were face to face in a narrow lane  and but for themselves it was empty  he
rubbed his eyes 
‘where is the king ’ he said  ‘and éowyn ’ then he stumbled
and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again 
‘they have gone up into the citadel ’ said pippin  ‘i think you must
have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning  when we found that
you were not with them  gandalf sent me to look for you  poor old merry  how
glad i am to see you again  but you are worn out  and i won’t bother you with
any talk  but tell me  are you hurt  or wounded ’
‘no ’ said merry  ‘well  no  i don’t think so  but i can’t use my
right arm  pippin  not since i stabbed him  and my sword burned all away like a
piece of wood ’
pippin’s face was anxious  ‘well  you had better come with me as quick as
you can ’ he said  ‘i wish i could carry you  you aren’t fit to walk any
further  they shouldn’t have let you walk at all  but you must forgive them 
so many dreadful things have happened in the city  merry  that one poor hobbit
coming in from the battle is easily overlooked ’
‘it’s not always a misfortune being overlooked ’ said merry  ‘i was
overlooked just now by - no  no  i can’t speak of it  help me  pippin  it’s
all going dark again  and my arm is so cold ’
‘lean on me  merry lad ’ said pippin  ‘come now  foot by foot  it’s
not far ’
‘are you going to bury me ’ said merry 
‘no  indeed ’ said pippin  trying to sound cheerful  though his heart was
wrung with fear and pity  ‘no  we are going to the houses of healing ’
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall
of the fourth circle  and they regained the main street climbing up to the
citadel  step by step they went  while merry swayed and murmured as one in
sleep 
‘i’ll never get him there ’ thought pippin  ‘is there no one to help
me  i can’t leave him here ’ just then to his surprise a boy came running up
behind  and as he passed he recognized bergil beregond’s son 
‘hullo  bergil ’ he called  ‘where are you going  glad to see you
again  and still alive ’
‘i am running errands for the healers ’ said bergil  ‘i cannot stay ’
‘don’t ’ said pippin  ‘but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit  a perian mind you  come from the battle-field  i don’t think he
can walk so far  if mithrandir is there  he will be glad of the message ’
bergil ran on 
‘i’d better wait here ’ thought pippin  so he let merry sink gently
down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight  and then he sat down beside him 
laying merry’s head in his lap  he felt his body and limbs gently  and took
his friend’s hands in his own  the right hand felt icy to the touch 
it was not long before gandalf himself came in search of them  he stooped
over merry and caressed his brow  then he lifted him carefully  ‘he should
have been borne in honour into this city ’ he said  ‘he has well repaid my
trust  for if elrond had not yielded to me  neither of you would have set out 
and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have been ’ he sighed 
‘and yet here is another charge on my hands  while all the time the battle
hangs in the balance ’
so at last faramir and éowyn and meriadoc were laid in beds in the
houses of healing  and there they were tended well  for though all lore was in
these latter days fallen from its fullness of old  the leechcraft of
gondor was still wise  and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt  and all
such sickness as east of the sea mortal men were subject to  save old age only 
for that they had found no cure  and indeed the span of their lives had now
waned to little more than that of other men  and those among them who passed the
tale of five score years with vigour were grown few  save in some houses of
purer blood  but now their art and knowledge were baffled  for there were many
sick of a malady that would not be healed  and they
called it the black shadow  for it came from the nazgûl  and those who
were stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream  and then passed to
silence and a deadly cold  and so died  and it seemed to the tenders of the sick
that on the halfling and on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily  still at
whiles as the morning wore away they would speak  murmuring in their dreams  and
the watchers listened to all that they said  hoping perhaps to learn something
that would help them to understand their hurts  but soon they began to fall down
into the darkness  and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their
faces  but faramir burned with a fever that would not abate 
gandalf went from one to the other full of care  and he was told all that the
watchers could hear  and so the day passed  while the great battle outside went
on with shifting hopes and strange tidings  and still gandalf waited and watched
and did not go forth  till at last the red sunset filled all the sky  and the
light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick  then it seemed to
those who stood by that in the glow the faces flushed softly as with health
returning  but it was only a mockery of hope 
then an old wife  ioreth  the eldest of the women who served in that house 
looking on the fair face of faramir  wept  for all the people loved him  and she
said  ‘alas  if he should die  would that there were kings in gondor  as there
were once upon a time  they say  for it is said in old lore  the hands of the
king are the hands of a healer  and so the rightful king could ever be
known ’
and gandalf  who stood by  said  ‘men may long remember your words  ioreth 
for there is hope in them  maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor  or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the city ’
‘i have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and
shouting ’ she answered  ‘all i hope is that those murdering devils do not
come to this house and trouble the sick ’
then gandalf went out in haste  and already the fire in the sky was burning
out  and the smouldering hills were fading  while ash-grey evening crept over
the fields 
now as the sun went down aragorn and éomer and imrahil drew near the
city with their captains and knights  and when they came before the gate
aragorn said 
‘behold the sun setting in a great fire  it is a sign of the end and fall
of many things  and a change in the tides of the world  but this city and realm
has rested in the charge of the stewards for many long years  and i fear that if
i enter it unbidden  then doubt and debate may arise  which should not be while
this war is fought  i will not enter in  nor make any claim  until it be seen
whether we or mordor shall prevail  men shall pitch my tents upon the field  and
here i will await the welcome of the lord of the city ’
but éomer said  ‘already you have raised the banner of the kings and
displayed the tokens of elendil’s house  will you suffer these to be
challenged ’
‘no ’ said aragorn  ‘but i deem the time unripe  and i have no mind for
strife except with our enemy and his servants ’
and the prince imrahil said  your words  lord  are wise  if one who is a
kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in this matter  he is strong-willed
and proud  but old  and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken
down  yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door ’
‘not a beggar ’ said aragorn  ‘say a captain of the rangers  who are
unused to cities and houses of stone ’ and he commanded that his banner should
be furled  and he did off the star of the north kingdom and gave it to the
keeping of the sons of elrond 
then the prince imrahil and éomer of rohan left him and passed through
the city and the tumult of the people  and mounted to the citadel  and they came
to the hall of the tower  seeking the steward  but they found his chair empty 
and before the dais lay théoden king of the mark upon a bed of state  and
twelve torches stood about it  and twelve guards  knights both of rohan and
gondor  and the hangings of the bed were of green and white  but upon the
king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast  and upon that his
unsheathed sword  and at his feet his shield  the light of the torches shimmered
in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain  but his face was fair and
young  save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of youth  and it seemed that
he slept 
when they had stood silent for a time beside the king  imrahil said  ‘where
is the steward  and where also is mithrandir ’
and one of the guards answered  ‘the steward of gondor is in the houses of
healing ’
but éomer said  ‘where is the lady éowyn  my sister  for
surely she should be lying beside the king  and in no less honour  where have
they bestowed her ’
and imrahil said  ‘but the lady éowyn
was yet living when they bore her hither  did you not know ’
then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to éomer’s heart  and with
it the bite of care and fear renewed  that he said no more  but turned and went
swiftly from the hall  and the prince followed him  and when they came
forth evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky  and there came gandalf
on foot and with him one cloaked in grey  and they met before the doors of the
houses of healing  and they greeted gandalf and said 
‘we seek the steward  and men say that he is in this house  has any hurt
befallen him  and the lady éowyn  where is she ’
and gandalf answered  ‘she lies within and is not dead  but is near death 
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart  as you have heard  and he is
now the steward  for denethor has departed  and his house is in ashes ’ and
they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told 
but imrahil said  ‘so victory is shorn of gladness  and it is bitter
bought  if both gondor and rohan are in one day
bereft of their lords  éomer rules the rohirrim  who shall rule the city
meanwhile  shall we not send now for the lord aragorn ’
and the cloaked man spoke and said  ‘he is come ’ and they saw as he
stepped into the light of the lantern by the door
that it was aragorn  wrapped in the grey cloak of lórien above his mail 
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel  ‘i have come
because gandalf begs me to do so ’ he said  ‘but for the present i am but
the captain of the dúnedain of arnor  and the lord of dol amroth shall
rule the city until faramir awakes  but it is my counsel that gandalf should
rule us all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy ’ and
they agreed upon that 
then gandalf said  ‘let us not stay at the door  for the time is urgent 
let us enter  for it is only in the coming of aragorn that any hope remains for
the sick that lie in the house  thus spake ioreth  wise-woman of gondor  the
hands of the king are the hands of a healer  and so shall the rightful king be
known ’
then aragorn entered first and the others followed  and there at the door
were two guards in the livery of the citadel  one tall  but the other scarce the
height of a boy  and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise and joy 
‘strider  how splendid  do you know  i guessed it was you in the black
ships  but they were all shouting corsairs and wouldn’t listen to me 
how did you do it ’
aragorn laughed  and took the hobbit by the hand  ‘well met indeed ’ he
said  ‘but there is not time yet for travellers’ tales ’
but imrahil said to éomer  ‘is it thus that we speak to our kings 
yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name ’
and aragorn hearing him  turned and said  ‘verily  for in the high tongue
of old i am elessar  the elfstone  and envinyatar  the
renewer’  and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there  ‘but
strider shall be the name of my house  if that be ever established  in the high
tongue it will not sound so ill  and telcontar i will be and all the
heirs of my body ’
and with that they passed into the house  and as they went towards the rooms
where the sick were tended gandalf told of the deeds of éowyn and
meriadoc  ‘for ’ he said  ‘long have i stood by them and at first they
spoke much in their dreaming  before they sank into the deadly darkness 
also it is given to me to see many things far off ’
aragorn went first to faramir  and then to the lady éowyn  and last to
merry  when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed 
‘here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me ’ he said 
‘would that elrond were here  for he is the eldest of all our race  and has
the greater power ’
and éomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said  ‘first you
must rest  surely  and at the least eat a little ’
but aragorn answered  ‘nay  for these three  and most soon for faramir 
time is running out  all speed is needed ’
then he called to ioreth and he said  ‘you have store in this house of the
herbs of healing ’
‘yes  lord ’ she answered  ‘but not enough  i reckon  for all that will
need them  but i am sure i do not know where we shall find more  for all things
are amiss in these dreadful days  what with fires and burnings  and the lads
that run errands so few  and all the roads blocked  why  it is days out of count
since ever a carrier came in from lossarnach to the market  but we do our best
in this house with what we have  as i am sure your lordship will know ’
‘i will judge that when i see ’ said aragorn  ‘one thing also is short
time for speech  have you athelas ’
‘i do not know  i am sure  lord ’ she answered  ‘at least not by that
name  i will go and ask of the herb-master  he knows all the old names ’
‘it is also called kingsfoil ’ said aragorn  ‘and maybe you know
it by that name  for so the country-folk call it in these latter days ’ ‘oh
that ’ said ioreth  ‘well  if your lordship had named it at first i could
have told you  no  we have none of it  i am sure  why  i have never heard that
it had any great virtue  and indeed i have often said to my sisters when we came
upon it growing in the woods  “kingsfoil” i said  “ ‘tis a strange name 
and i wonder why ‘tis called so  for if i were a king  i would have plants
more bright in my garden”  still it smells sweet when bruised  does it not  if
sweet is the right word  wholesome  maybe  is nearer ’
‘wholesome verily ’ said aragorn  ‘and now  dame  if you love the lord
faramir  run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil  if there is a leaf in
the city ’
‘and if not ’ said gandalf  ‘i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth
behind me  and she shall take me to the woods  but not to her sisters  and
shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste ’
when ioreth was gone  aragorn bade the other women to make water hot  then he
took faramir s hand in his  and laid the other hand upon the sick man’s brow 
it was drenched with sweat  but faramir did not move or make any sign  and
seemed hardly to breathe 
‘he is nearly spent ’ said aragorn turning to gandalf  ‘but this comes
not from the wound  see  that is healing  had he
been smitten by some dart of the nazgûl  as you thought  he would have
died that night  this hurt was given by some southron arrow  i would guess  who
drew it forth  was it kept ’
‘i drew it forth ’ said imrahil  ‘and staunched the wound  but i did
not keep the arrow  for we had much to do  it was  as i remember  just such a
dart as the southrons use  yet i believed that it came from the shadows above 
for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood  since the wound was
not deep or vital  how then do you read the matter ’
‘weariness  grief for his father’s mood  a wound  and over all the black
breath ’ said aragorn  ‘he is a man of staunch will  for already he had come
close under the shadow before ever he rode to battle on the out-walls  slowly
the dark must have crept on him  even as he fought and strove to hold his
outpost  would that i could have been here sooner ’
thereupon the herb-master entered  ‘your lordship asked for kingsfoil  as
the rustics name it  he said  or athelas in the noble tongue  or to those
who know somewhat of the valinorean     ’
‘i do so ’ said aragorn  ‘and i care not whether you say now asëa
aranion or kingsfoil  so long as you have some ’
‘your pardon lord ’ said the man  ‘i see you are a lore-master  not
merely a captain of war  but alas  sir  we do not keep this thing in the houses
of healing  where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended  for it has no virtue
that we know of  save perhaps to sweeten a fouled air  or to drive away some
passing heaviness  unless  of course  you give heed to rhymes of old days which
women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding 
when the black breath blows

and death’s shadow grows

and all lights pass 

come athelas  come athelas 

life to the dying

in the king’s hand lying 
it is but a doggrel  i fear  garbled in the memory of old wives  its meaning
i leave to your judgement  if indeed it has any  but old folk still use an
infusion of the herb for headaches ’
‘then in the name of the king  go and find some old man of less lore and
more wisdom who keeps some in his house ’ cried gandalf 
now aragorn knelt beside faramir  and held a hand upon his brow  and those
that watched felt that some great struggle was going on  for aragorn’s face
grew grey with weariness  and ever and anon he called the name of faramir  but
each time more faintly to their hearing  as if aragorn himself was removed from
them  and walked afar in some dark vale  calling for one that was lost 
and at last bergil came running in  and he bore six leaves in a cloth  ‘it
is kingsfoil  sir ’ he said  ‘but not fresh  i fear  it must have been
culled two weeks ago at the least  i hope it will serve  sir ’ then looking at
faramir he burst into tears 
but aragorn smiled  ‘it will serve ’ he said  ‘the worst is now over 
stay and be comforted ’ then taking two leaves  he laid them on his hands and
breathed on them  and then he crushed them  and straightway a living freshness
filled the room  as if the air itself awoke and tingled  sparkling with joy  and
then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that were brought to
him  and at once all hearts were lightened  for the fragrance that came to each
was like a memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land of which the
fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory  but aragorn stood up as
one refreshed  and his eyes smiled as he held a bowl before faramir’s dreaming
face 
‘well now  who would have believed it ’ said ioreth to a woman that stood
beside her  ‘the weed is better than i thought  it reminds me of the roses of
imloth melui when i was a lass  and no king could ask for better ’
suddenly faramir stirred  and he opened his eyes  and he looked on aragorn
who bent over him  and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes 
and he spoke softly  ‘my lord  you called me  i come  what does the king
command ’
‘walk no more in the shadows  but awake ’ said aragorn  ‘you are weary 
rest a while  and take food  and be ready when i return ’
‘i will  lord ’ said faramir  ‘for who would lie idle when the king has
returned ’
‘farewell then for a while ’ said aragorn  ‘i must go to others who
need me ’ and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil  but beregond and
his son remained behind  unable to contain their joy  as he followed gandalf and
shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim 
‘king  did you hear that  what did i say  the hands of a healer  i said ’
and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was indeed come
among them  and after war he brought healing  and the news ran through the city 
but aragorn came to éowyn  and he said  ‘here there is a grievous
hurt and a heavy blow  the arm that was broken has been tended with due skill 
and it will mend in time  if she has the strength to live  it is the
shield-arm that is maimed  but the chief evil comes through the sword-arm  in
that there now seems no life  although it is unbroken 
‘alas  for she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind or
body  and those who will take a weapon to such an enemy must be sterner than
steel  if the very shock shall not destroy them  it was an evil doom that set
her in his path  for she is a fair maiden  fairest lady of a house of queens 
and yet i know not how i should speak of her  when i first looked on her and
perceived her unhappiness  it seemed to me that i saw a white flower standing
straight and proud  shapely as a lily  and yet knew that it was hard  as if
wrought by elf-wrights out of steel  or was it  maybe  a frost that had turned
its sap to ice  and so it stood  bitter-sweet  still fair to see  but stricken 
soon to fall and die  her malady begins far back before this day  does it not 
éomer ’
‘i marvel that you should ask me  lord ’ he answered  ‘for i hold you
blameless in this matter  as in all else  yet i
knew not that éowyn  my sister  was touched by any frost  until she first
looked on you  care and dread she had  and shared with me  in the days of
wormtongue and the king’s bewitchment  and she tended the king in growing fear 
but that did not bring her to this pass ’
‘my friend ’ said gandalf  ‘you had horses  and deeds of arms  and the
free fields  but she  born in the body of a maid  had a spirit and courage at
least the match of yours  yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man  whom she
loved as a father  and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured dotage  and her
part seemed to her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on 
‘think you that wormtongue had poison only for théoden’s ears  dotard 
what is the house of eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek 
and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs  have you not heard those
words before  saruman spoke them  the teacher of wormtongue  though i do not
doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped their meaning in terms more cunning  my
lord  if your sister’s love for you  and her will still bent to her duty  had
not restrained her lips  you might have heard even such things as these escape
them  but who knows what she spoke to the darkness  alone  in the bitter watches
of the night  when all her life seemed shrinking  and the walls of her bower
closing in about her  a hutch to trammel some wild thing in ’
then éomer was silent  and looked on his sister  as if pondering anew
all the days of their past life together  but aragorn said  ‘i saw also what
you saw  éomer  few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have
more bitterness and shame for a man’s heart than to behold the love of a lady
so fair and brave that cannot be returned sorrow and pity have followed me ever
since i left her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of the dead  and
no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her  and
yet  éomer  i say to you that she loves you more truly than me  for you
she loves and knows  but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought  a hope of
glory and great deeds  and lands far from the fields of rohan 
‘i have  maybe  the power to heal her body  and to recall her from the dark
valley  but to what she will awake  hope  or forgetfulness  or despair  i do not
know  and if to despair  then she will die  unless other healing comes which i
cannot bring  alas  for her deeds have set her among the queens of great
renown ’
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face  and it was indeed white as a
lily  cold as frost  and hard as graven stone  but he bent and kissed her on the
brow  and called her softly  saying 
‘éowyn éomund’s daughter  awake  for your enemy has passed
away ’
she did not stir  but now she began again to breathe deeply  so that her
breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet  once more aragorn
bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water  and he
laved her brow with it  and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the
coverlet 
then  whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse  or
whether it was but his words of the lady éowyn that wrought on them  as
the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those who
stood by that a keen wind blew through the window  and it bore no scent 
but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young  as if it had not before been
breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath
a dome of stars  or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam 
‘awake  éowyn  lady of rohan ’ said aragorn again  and he took her
right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning  ‘awake  the shadow is
gone and all darkness is washed clean ’ then he laid her hand in éomer’s
and stepped away  ‘call her ’ he said  and he passed silently from
the chamber 
‘éowyn  éowyn ’ cried éomer amid his tears  but she
opened her eyes and said  ‘éomer  what joy is this  for they said that
you were slain  nay  but that was only the dark voices in my dream  how
long have i been dreaming ’
‘not long  my sister ’ said éomer  ‘but think no more on it ’
‘ i am strangely weary ’ she said  ‘i must rest a little  but tell me 
what of the lord of the mark  alas  do not tell me that that was a dream for i
know that it was not  he is dead as he foresaw ’
‘he is dead ’ said éomer  ‘but he bade me say farewell to
éowyn dearer than daughter  he lies now in great honour in the citadel of
gondor ’
‘that is grievous ’ she said  ‘and yet it is good beyond all that i
dared hope in the dark days  when it seemed that
the house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherd’s cot  and what of
the king’s esquire  the halfling  éomer  you shall make him a knight of
the riddermark  for he is valiant ’
‘he lies nearby in this house  and i will go
to him ’ said gandalf  ‘éomer shall stay here for a while  but do not
speak yet of war or woe  until you are made whole again  great gladness it is to
see you wake again to health and hope  so valiant a lady ’
‘to health ’ said éowyn  ‘it may be so  at least while
there is an empty saddle of some fallen rider that i can fill  and there are
deeds to do  but to hope  i do not know ’
gandalf and pippin came to merry’s room  and there they found aragorn
standing by the bed  ‘poor old merry ’ cried pippin  and he ran to the
bedside  for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse  and a greyness was
in his face  as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him  and suddenly a fear
seized pippin that merry would die 
‘do not be afraid ’ said aragorn  ‘i came
in time  and i have called him back  he is weary now  and grieved  and he has
taken a hurt like the lady éowyn  daring to smite that deadly thing  but
these evils can be amended  so strong and gay a spirit is in him  his grief he
will not forget  but it will not darken his heart  it will teach him
wisdom ’
then aragorn laid his hand on merry’s head  and passing his hand gently
through the brown curls  he touched the eyelids  and called him by name  and
when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room  like the scent of
orchards  and of heather in the sunshine full of bees  suddenly merry awoke  and
he said 
‘i am hungry  what is the time ’
‘past supper-time now ’ said pippin  ‘though i daresay i could bring
you something  if they will let me ’
‘they will indeed ’ said gandalf  ‘and anything else that this rider of
rohan may desire  if it can be found in minas tirith  where his name is in
honour ’
‘good ’ said merry  ‘then i would like supper first  and after that a
pipe ’ at that his face clouded  ‘no  not a pipe  i don’t think i’ll
smoke again ’
‘why not ’ said pippin 
‘well ’ answered merry slowly  ‘he is dead  it has brought it all back
to me  he said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore with
me  almost the last thing he ever said  i shan’t ever be able to smoke again
without thinking of him  and that day  pippin  when he rode up to isengard and
was so polite ’
‘smoke then  and think of him ’ said aragorn  ‘for he was a gentle
heart and a great king and kept his oaths  and he rose out of the shadows to a
last fair morning  though your service to him was brief  it should be a memory
glad and honourable to the end of your days ’
merry smiled  ‘well then ’ he said  ‘if strider will provide what is
needed  i will smoke and think  i had some of saruman’s best in my pack  but
what became of it in the battle  i am sure i don’t know ’
‘master meriadoc ’ said aragorn  ‘if you think that i have passed
through the mountains and the realm of gondor with fire and sword to bring herbs
to a careless soldier who throws away his gear  you are mistaken  if your pack
has not been found  then you must send for the herb-master of this house  and he
will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire had any virtues  but
that it is called westmansweed by the vulgar  and galenas by the
noble  and other names in other tongues more learned  and after adding a few
half-forgotten rhymes that he does not understand  he will regretfully inform
you that there is none in the house  and he will leave you to reflect on the
history of tongues  and so now must i  for i have not slept in such a bed as
this  since i rode from dunharrow  nor eaten since the dark before dawn ’
merry seized his hand and kissed it  ‘i am frightfully sorry ’ he said 
‘go at once  ever since that night at bree we have been a nuisance to you  but
it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than
they mean  we fear to say too much  it robs us of the right words when a jest is
out of place ’
‘i know that well  or i would not deal with you in the same way ‘ said
aragorn  ‘may the shire live for ever unwithered ’ and kissing merry he went
out  and gandalf went with him 
pippin remained behind  ‘was there ever any one like him ’ he said 
‘except gandalf  of course  i think they must be related  my dear ass  your
pack is lying by your bed  and you had it on your back when i met you  he saw it
all the time  of course  and anyway i have some stuff of my own  come on now 
longbottom leaf it is  fill up while i run and see about some food  and then
let’s be easy for a bit  dear me  we tooks and brandybucks  we can’t live
long on the heights ’
‘no ’ said merry  ‘i can’t  not yet  at any rate  but at least 
pippin  we can now see them  and honour them  it is best to love first what you
are fitted to love  i suppose  you must start somewhere and have some roots  and
the soil of the shire is deep  still there are things deeper and higher  and not
a gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace but for them  whether he
knows about them or not  i am glad that i know about them  a little  but i
don’t know why i am talking like this  where is that leaf  and get my pipe out
of my pack  if it isn’t broken ’
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the houses of healing 
and they counselled him that faramir and éowyn should remain there and
still be tended with care for many days 
‘the lady éowyn ’ said aragorn  ‘will wish soon to rise and
depart  but she should not be permitted to do so  if you can in any way restrain
her  until at least ten days be passed ’
‘as for faramir ’ said gandalf  ‘he must soon learn that his father is
dead  but the full tale of the madness of denethor should not be told to him 
until he is quite healed and has duties to do  see that beregond and the perian
who were present do not speak to him of these things yet ’
and the other perian meriadoc who is under my care  what of him ’
said the warden 
‘it is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow  for a short while ’
said aragorn  ‘let him do so  if he wishes  he may walk a little in the care
of his friends ’
‘they are a remarkable race ’ said the warden  nodding his head  ‘very
tough in the fibre  i deem ’
at the doors of the houses many were already gathered to see aragorn  and
they followed after him  and when at last he had supped  men came and prayed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in peril
through hurt or wound  or who lay under the black shadow  and aragorn arose and
went out  and he sent for the sons of elrond  and together they laboured far
into the night  and word went through the city  ‘the king is come again
indeed ’ and they named him elfstone  because of the green stone that he wore 
and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen for him by his own people 
and when he could labour no more  he cast his cloak about him  and slipped
out of the city  and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a little  and
in the morning the banner of dol amroth  a white ship like a swan upon blue
water  floated from the tower  and men looked up and wondered if the coming of
the king had been but a dream 
 
the morning came after the day of battle  and it was fair with light clouds
and the wind turning westward  legolas and gimli were early abroad  and they
begged leave to go up into the city  for they were eager to see merry and
pippin 
‘it is good to learn that they are still alive ’ said gimli  ‘for they
cost us great pains in our march over rohan  and i would not have such pains all
wasted ’
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith  and folk that saw them
pass marvelled to see such companions  for legolas was fair of face beyond the
measure of men  and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the
morning  but gimli stalked beside him  stroking his beard and staring about him 
‘there is some good stone-work here ’ he said as he looked at the walls 
‘but also some that is less good  and the streets could be better contrived 
when aragorn comes into his own  i shall offer him the service of stonewrights
of the mountain  and we will make this a town to be proud of ’
‘they need more gardens ’ said legolas  ‘the houses are dead  and there
is too little here that grows and is glad  if aragorn comes into his own  the
people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die ’
at length they came to the prince imrahil  and legolas looked at him and
bowed low  for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his veins 
‘hail  lord ’ he said  ‘it is long since the people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lórien  and yet still one may see that not all sailed from
amroth’s haven west over water ’
‘so it is said in the lore of my land ’ said the prince  ‘yet never has
one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count  and i marvel to see
one here now in the midst of sorrow and war  what do you seek ’
‘i am one of the nine companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris 
said legolas and with this dwarf  my friend  i came with the lord aragorn  but
now we wish to see our friends  meriadoc and peregrin  who are in your keeping 
we are told ’
‘you will find them in the houses of healing  and i will lead you
thither ’ said imrahil 
‘it will be enough if you send one to guide
us  lord ’ said legolas  ‘for aragorn sends this message to you  he does not
wish to enter the city again at this time  yet there is need for the captains to
hold council at once  and he prays that you and éomer of rohan will come
down to his tents  as soon as may be  mithrandir is already there ’
‘we will come ’ said imrahil  and they parted with courteous words 
‘that is a fair lord and a great captain of men ’ said legolas  ‘if
gondor has such men still in these days of fading  great must have been its
glory in the days of its rising ’
‘and doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought in the
first building ’ said gimli  ‘it is ever so with the things that men begin 
there is a frost in spring  or a blight in summer  and they fail of their
promise ’
‘yet seldom do they fail of their seed ’ said legolas  ‘and that will
lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for  the
deeds of men will outlast us  gimli ’
‘and yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens  i guess ’ said
the dwarf 
‘to that the elves know not the answer ’ said legolas 
with that the servant of the prince came and led them to the houses of
healing  and there they found their friends in the garden  and their meeting was
a merry one  for a while they walked and talked  rejoicing for a brief space in
peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of the city  then
when merry became weary  they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of
the houses of healing behind them  and away southward before them was the anduin
glittering in the sun  as it flowed away  out of the sight even of legolas  into
the wide flats and green haze of lebennin and south ithilien 
and now legolas fell silent  while the others talked  and he looked out
against the sun  and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the river 
‘look ’ he cried  ‘gulls  they are flying far inland  a wonder they are
to me and a trouble to my heart  never in all my life had i met them  until we
came to pelargir  and there i heard them crying in the air as we rode to the
battle of the ships  then i stood still  forgetting war in middle-earth  for
their wailing voices spoke to me of the sea  the sea  alas  i have not yet
beheld it  but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing  which
it is perilous to stir  alas  for the gulls  no peace shall i have again under
beech or under elm ’
‘say not so ’ said gimli  ‘there are countless things still to see in
middle-earth  and great works to do  but if all the fair folk take to the
havens  it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay ’
‘dull and dreary indeed ’ said merry  ‘you must not go to the havens 
legolas  there will always be some folk  big or little  and even a few wise
dwarves like gimli  who need you  at least i hope so  though i feel somehow that
the worst of this war is still to come  how i wish it was all over  and well
over ’
‘don’t be so gloomy ’ cried pippin  ‘the sun is shining  and here we
are together for a day or two at least  i want to hear more about you all  come 
gimli  you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a
dozen times already this morning  but you haven’t told me anything about
it ’
‘the sun may shine here ’ said gimli  ‘but there are memories of that
road that i do not wish to recall out of the darkness  had i known what was
before me  i think that not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of
the dead ’
‘the paths of the dead ’ said pippin  ‘i heard aragorn say that and i
wondered what he could mean  won’t you tell us some more ’
‘not willingly ’ said gimli  ‘for upon that road i was put to shame 
gimli glóin’s son  who had deemed himself more tough than men  and
hardier under earth than any elf  but neither did i prove  and i was held
to the road only by the will of aragorn ’
‘and by the love of him also ’ said legolas  ‘for all those who come to
know him come to love him after his own fashion  even the cold maiden of the
rohirrim  it was at early morn of the day ere you came
there  merry  that we left dunharrow  and such a fear was on all the folk that
none would look on our going  save the lady éowyn  who lies now hurt in
the house below  there was grief at that parting  and i was grieved to behold
it ’
‘alas  i had heart only for myself ’ said gimli  ‘nay  i will not speak
of that journey ’
he fell silent  but pippin and merry were so eager for news that at last
legolas said  ‘i will tell you enough for your peace  for i felt not the
horror  and i feared not the shadows of men  powerless and frail as i deemed
them ’
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains  and the dark
tryst at erech  and the great ride thence  ninety leagues and three  to pelargir
on anduin  ‘four days and nights  and on into a fifth  we rode from the black
stone ’ he said  ‘and lo  in the darkness of mordor my hope rose  for in
that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible to look
upon  some i saw riding  some striding  yet all moving with the same great
speed  silent they were  but there was a gleam in their eyes  in the uplands of
lamedon they overtook our horses  and swept round us  and would have passed us
by  if aragorn had not forbidden them 
‘at his command they fell back  “even the shades of men are obedient to
his will ” i thought  “they may serve his needs yet  “
‘one day of light we rode  and then came the day without dawn  and still we
rode on  and ciril and ringló we crossed  and on the third day we came to
linhir above the mouth of gilrain  and there men of lamedon contested the
fords with fell folk of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river  but
defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we came  crying out
that the king of the dead was upon them  only angbor  lord of lamedon  had the
heart to abide us  and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come behind  if they
dared  when the grey host had passed 
‘ “at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you ” he said 
‘thus we crossed over gilrain  driving the allies of mordor in rout before
us  and then we rested a while  but soon aragorn arose  saying  “lo  already
minas tirith is assailed  i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid ” so
we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all the speed that our
horses could endure over the plains of lebennin ’
legolas paused and sighed  and turning his eyes southward softly he sang 
silver flow the streams from celos to erui

in the green fields of lebennin 

tall grows the grass there  in the wind from the sea

the white lilies sway 

and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin

in the green fields of lebennin 

in the wind from the sea 
‘green are those fields in the songs of my people  but they were dark then 
grey wastes in the blackness before us  and over the wide land  trampling
unheeded the grass and the flowers  we hunted our foes through a day and a
night  until we came at the bitter end to the great river at last 
‘then i thought in my heart that we drew near to the sea  for wide was the
water in the darkness  and sea-birds innumerable cried on its  shores  alas for
the wailing of the gulls  did not the lady tell me to beware of them  and now i
cannot forget them ’
‘for my part i heeded them not ’ said gimli  ‘for we came then at last
upon battle in earnest  there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar  fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count  many of those that we pursued had
reached the havens before us  and brought their fear with them  and some of the
ships had put off  seeking to escape down the river or to reach the far shore 
and many of the smaller craft were ablaze  but the haradrim  being now driven to
the brink  turned at bay  and they were fierce in despair  and they laughed when
they looked on us  for they were a great army still 
‘but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice  “now come  by the black
stone i call you  “ and suddenly the shadow host that had hung back at the
last came up like a grey tide  sweeping all away before it  faint cries i heard 
and dim horns blowing  and a murmur as of countless far voices  it was like the
echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago  pale swords were
drawn  but i know not whether their blades would still bite  for the dead needed
no longer any weapon but fear  none would withstand them 
‘to every ship they came that was drawn up  and then they passed over the
water to those that were anchored  and all the mariners were filled with a
madness of terror and leaped overboard  save the slaves chained to the oars 
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes  driving
them like leaves  until we came to the shore  and then to each of the great
ships that remained aragorn sent one of the dúnedain  and they comforted
the captives that were aboard  and bade them put aside fear and be free 
‘ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all were
drowned  or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot 
strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of mordor should be
overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness  with its own weapons was it
worsted ’
‘strange indeed ’ said legolas  ‘in that hour i looked on aragorn and
thought how great and terrible a lord he might have become in the strength of
his will  had he taken the ring to himself  not for naught does mordor
fear him  but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron  for is he
not of the children of lúthien  never shall that line fail  though the
years may lengthen beyond count ’
‘beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings ’ said gimli 
‘but mighty indeed was aragorn that day  lo  all the black fleet was in his
hands  and he chose the greatest ship to be his own  and he went up into it 
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy  and the
shadow host withdrew to the shore  there they stood silent  hardly to be seen 
save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were
burning  and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead men  crying 
‘ “hear now the words of the heir of isildur  your oath is fulfilled  go
back and trouble not the valleys ever again  depart and be at rest  “
‘and thereupon the king of the dead stood out before the host and broke his
spear and cast it down  then he bowed low and turned away  and swiftly the whole
grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by a sudden
wind  and it seemed to me that i awoke from a dream 
‘that night we rested while others laboured  for there were many captives
set free  and many slaves released who had been folk of gondor taken in raids 
and soon also there was a great gathering of men out of lebennin and the ethir 
and angbor of lamedon came up with all the horsemen that he could muster  now
that the fear of the dead was removed they came to aid us and to look on the
heir of isildur  for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark 
‘and that is near the end of our tale  for during that evening and night
many ships were made ready and manned  and in the morning the fleet set forth 
long past it now seems  yet it was but the morn of the day ere yesterday  the
sixth since we rode from dunharrow  but still aragorn was driven by fear that
time was too short 
‘ “it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the landings at the
harlond ” he said  “yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail
utterly ”
‘the oars were now wielded by free men  and manfully they laboured  yet
slowly we passed up the great river  for we strove against its stream  and
though that is not swift down in the south  we had no help of wind  heavy would
my heart have been  for all our victory at the havens  if legolas had not
laughed suddenly 
‘ “up with your beard  durin’s son  “ he said  “for thus is it
spoken  oft hope is born  when all is forlorn ” but what hope he saw
from afar he would not tell  when night came it did but deepen the darkness  and
our hearts were hot  for away in the north we saw a red glow under the cloud 
and aragorn said  “minas tirith is burning ”
‘but at midnight hope was indeed born anew  sea-crafty men of the ethir
gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the sea  long
ere day the masted ships hoisted sail  and our speed grew  until dawn whitened
the foam at our prows  and so it was  as you know  that we came in the third
hour of the morning with a fair wind and the sun unveiled  and we unfurled the
great standard in battle  it was a great day and a great hour  whatever may come
after ’
‘follow what may  great deeds are not lessened in worth ’ said legolas 
‘great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead  and great it shall
remain  though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to
come ’
‘and that may well befall ’ said gimli  ‘for the faces of aragorn and
gandalf are grave  much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents
there below  for my part  like merry  i wish that with our victory the war was
now over  yet whatever is still to do  i hope to have a part in it  for the
honour of the folk of the lonely mountain ’
‘and i for the folk of the great wood ’ said legolas  ‘and for the love
of the lord of the white tree ’
then the companions fell silent  but a while they sat there in the high
place  each busy with his own thoughts  while the captains debated 
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli  at once
he sent for éomer  and he went down with him from the city  and they came
to the tents of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place
where king théoden had fallen  and there they took counsel together with
gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond 
‘my lords ’ said gandalf  ‘listen to the words of the steward of gondor
before he died  you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day  but
against the power that has now arisen there is no victory  i do not bid you
despair  as he did  but to ponder the truth in these words 
‘the stones of seeing do not lie  and not even the lord of barad-dûr
can make them do so  he can  maybe  by his will choose what things shall be seen
by weaker minds  or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see 
nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great forces arrayed
against him in mordor  and more still being gathered  he saw that which truly
is 
‘hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault  the
next will be greater  this war then is without final hope  as denethor
perceived  victory cannot be achieved by arms  whether you sit here to endure
siege after siege  or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river  you have
only a choice of evils  and prudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong
places as you have  and there await the onset  for so shall the time before your
end be made a little longer ’
‘then you would have us retreat to minas tirith  or dol amroth  or to
dunharrow  and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is
flowing ’ said imrahil 
‘that would be no new counsel ’ said gandalf  ‘have you not done this
and little more in all the days of denethor  but no  i said this would be
prudent  i do not counsel prudence  i said victory could
not be achieved by arms  i still hope for victory  but not by arms  for into the
midst of all these policies comes the ring of power  the foundation of barad-dûr 
and the hope of sauron 
‘concerning this thing  my lords  you now all know enough for the
understanding of our plight  and of sauron’s  if he regains it  your valour is
vain  and his victory will be swift and complete  so complete that none can
foresee the end of it while this world lasts  if it is destroyed  then he will
fall  and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again 
for he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his
beginning  and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble  and he
will be maimed for ever  becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in
the shadows  but cannot again grow or take shape  and so a great evil of this
world will be removed 
‘other evils there are that may come  for sauron is himself but a servant
or emissary  yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world  but to
do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set  uprooting
the evil in the fields that we know  so that those who live after may have clean
earth to till  what weather they shall have is not ours to rule 
‘now sauron knows all this  and he knows that this precious thing which he
lost has been found again  but he does not yet know where it is  or so we hope 
and therefore he is now in great doubt  for if we have found this thing  there
are some among us with strength enough to wield it  that too he knows  for do i
not guess rightly  aragorn  that you have shown yourself to him in the stone of
orthanc ’
‘i did so ere i rode from the hornburg ’ answered aragorn  ‘i deemed
that the time was ripe  and that the stone had come to me for just such a
purpose  it was then ten days since the ring-bearer went east from rauros  and
the eye of sauron  i thought  should be drawn out from his own land  too seldom
has he been challenged since he returned to his tower  though if i had foreseen
how swift would be his onset in answer  maybe i should not have dared to show
myself  bare time was given me to come to your aid ’
‘but how is this ’ asked éomer  ‘all is vain  you say  if he has
the ring  why should he think it not vain to assail us  if we have it ’
‘he is not yet sure ’ said gandalf  ‘and he has not built up his power
by waiting until his enemies are secure  as we have done  also we could not
learn how to wield the full power all in a day  indeed it can be used only by
one master alone  not by many  and he will look for a time of strife  ere one of
the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others  in that time
the ring might aid him  if he were sudden 
‘he is watching  he sees much and hears much  his
nazgûl are still abroad  they passed over this field ere the sunrise 
though few of the weary and sleeping were aware of them  he studies the signs 
the sword that robbed him of his treasure re-made  the winds of fortune turning
in our favour  and the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault the fall
of his great captain 
‘his doubt will be growing  even as we speak here  his eye is now straining
towards us  blind almost to all else that is moving  so we must keep it  therein
lies all our hope  this  then  is my counsel  we have not the ring  in wisdom or
great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed  lest it destroy us  without
it we cannot by force defeat his force  but we must at all costs keep his eye
from his true peril  we cannot achieve victory by arms  but by arms we can give
the ring-bearer his only chance  frail though it be 
‘as aragorn has begun  so we must go on  we must push sauron to his last
throw  we must call out his hidden strength  so that he shall empty his land  we
must march out to meet him at once  we must make ourselves the bait  though his
jaws should close on us  he will take that bait  in hope and in greed  for he
will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of the new ringlord  and he
will say  “so  he pushes out his neck too soon and too far  let him come on 
and behold i will have him in a trap from which he cannot escape  there i will
crush him  and what he has taken in his insolence shall be mine again for
ever ”
‘we must walk open-eyed into that trap  with courage  but
small hope for ourselves  for  my lords  it may well prove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands  so that even
if barad-dûr be thrown down  we shall not live to see a new age  but this 
i deem  is our duty  and better so than to perish nonetheless - as we
surely shall  if we sit here - and know as we die that no new age shall be ’
they were silent for a while  at length aragorn spoke  ‘as i have begun  so
i will go on  we come now to the very brink  where hope and despair are akin  to
waver is to fall  let none now reject the counsels of gandalf  whose long
labours against sauron come at last to their test  but for him all would long
ago have been lost  nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man  let
others choose as they will ’
then said elrohir  ‘from the north we came with this purpose  and from
elrond our father we brought this very counsel  we will not turn back ’
‘as for myself ’ said éomer  ‘i have little knowledge of these
deep matters  but i need it not  this i know  and it is enough  that as
my friend aragorn succoured me and my people  so i will aid him when he calls  i
will go ’
‘as for me ’ said imrahil  ‘the lord aragorn i hold to be my
liege-lord  whether he claim it or no  his wish is to me a command  i will go
also  yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of gondor  and it is
mine to think first of its people  to prudence some heed must still be given 
for we must prepare against all chances  good as well as evil  now  it may be
that we shall triumph  and while there is any hope of this  gondor must be
protected  i would not have us return with victory to a city in ruins and a land
ravaged behind us  and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is an army
still unfought upon our northern flank ’
‘that is true ’ said gandalf  ‘i do not counsel you to leave the city
all unmanned  indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough for
any assault in earnest upon mordor  so long as it be great enough to challenge
battle  and it must move soon  therefore i ask the captains  what force could we
muster and lead out in two days’ time at the latest  and they must be hardy
men that go willingly  knowing their peril ’
‘all are weary  and very many have wounds light or grievous ’ said
éomer  ‘and we have suffered much loss of our horses  and that is ill
to bear  if we must ride soon  then i cannot hope to lead even two thousands 
and yet leave as many for the defence of the city ’
‘we have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ‘ said
aragorn  ‘new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs  now that the
coasts have been rid  four thousands i sent marching from pelargir through
lossarnach two days ago  and angbor the fearless rides before them  if we set
out in two days more  they will draw nigh ere we depart  moreover many were
bidden to follow me up the river in any craft they could gather  and with this
wind they will soon be at hand  indeed several ships have already come to the
harlond  i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse and foot  and
yet leave the city in better defence than it was when the assault began ’
‘the gate is destroyed ’ said imrahil  ‘and where now is the skill to
rebuild it and set it up anew ’
‘in erebor in the kingdom of dáin there is such skill ’ said
aragorn  ‘and if all our hopes do not perish  then in time i will send gimli
glóin’s son to ask for wrights of the mountain  but men are better than
gates  and no gate will endure against our enemy if men desert it ’
this then was the end of the debate of the lords  that they should set forth
on the second morning from that day with seven thousands  if these might be
found  and the great part of this force should be on foot  because of the evil
lands into which they would go  aragorn should find
some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the south  but
imrahil should find three and a half thousands  and éomer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy  and he himself
should lead five hundreds of his best riders on horse  and another company of
five hundred horse there should be  among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dúnedain and the knights of dol amroth  all told six thousand
foot and a thousand horse  but the main strength of the rohirrim that remained
horsed and able to fight  some three thousand under the command of elfhelm 
should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in anórien  and at
once swift riders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards  and
eastwards from osgiliath and the road to minas morgul 
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken thought for the
journeys they should make and the roads they should choose  imrahil suddenly
laughed aloud 
‘surely ’ he cried  ‘this is the greatest jest in all the history of
gondor  that we should ride with seven thousands  scarce as many as the vanguard
of its army in the days of its power  to assail the mountains and the
impenetrable gate of the black land  so might a child threaten a mail-clad
knight with a bow of string and green willow  if the dark lord knows so much as
you say  mithrandir  will he not rather smile than fear  and with his little
finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him ’
‘no  he will try to trap the fly and take the sting ’ said gandalf 
‘and there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad
knights apiece  no  he will not smile ’
‘neither shall we ’ said aragorn  ‘if this be jest  then it is too
bitter for laughter  nay  it is the last move in a
great jeopardy  and for one side or the other it will bring the end of the
game ’ then he drew andúril and held it up glittering in the sun 
‘you shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought ’ he said 
 
two days later the army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor  the
host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out of anórien  but harried
and scattered by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting
towards cair andros  and with that threat destroyed and new strength
arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be  scouts
reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross-roads
of the fallen king  all now was ready for the last throw 
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in
the company of aragorn and gandalf  who went in the van with the dúnedain
and the sons of elrond  but merry to his shame was not to go with them 
‘you are not fit for such a journey ’ said aragorn  ‘but do not be
ashamed  if you do no more in this war  you have already earned great honour 
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk  and do not grudge him his chance
of peril  for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him  he has yet
to match your deed  but in truth all now are in like danger  though it may be
our part to find bitter end before the gate of mordor  if we do so  then you
will come also to a last stand  either here or wherever the black tide overtakes
you  farewell ’
and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army 
bergil was with him  and he also was downcast  for his father was to march
leading a company of the men of the city  he could not rejoin the guard until
his case was judged  in that same company pippin was also to go  as a soldier of
gondor  merry could see him not far off  a small but upright figure among the
tall men of minas tirith 
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move  troop by troop  and
company by company  they wheeled and went off eastward  and long after they had
passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway  merry stood there 
the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost  and
still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart  feeling friendless and alone 
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the gloom that hung over the
distant eastern sky  and little hope at all was left in his heart that he would
ever see any of them again 
as if recalled by his mood of despair  the pain in his arm returned  and he
felt weak and old  and the sunlight seemed thin  he was roused by the touch of
bergil’s hand 
‘come  master perian ’ said the lad  ‘you are still in pain  i see  i
will help you back to the healers  but do not fear  they will come back  the men
of minas tirith will never be overcome  and now they have the lord elfstone  and
beregond of the guard too ’
ere noon the army came to osgiliath  there all the workers and craftsmen that
could be spared were busy  some were strengthening the ferries and boat-bridges
that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when they fled  some gathered
stores and booty  and others on the eastern side across the river were throwing
up hasty works of defence 
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor  and over the wide
river  and on up the long straight road that in the high days had been made to
run from the fair tower of the sun to the tall tower of the moon  which now was
minas morgul in its accursed vale  five miles beyond osgiliath they halted 
ending their first day’s march 
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the cross-roads and
the great ring of trees  and all was silent  no sign of any enemy had they seen 
no cry or call had been heard  no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the
way  yet ever as they went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land
increase  tree and stone  blade and leaf were listening  the darkness had been
dispelled  and far away westward sunset was on the vale of anduin  and the white
peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air  but
a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel dúath 
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the ring
of trees  and they blew a great fanfare  and the heralds cried aloud  ‘the
lords of gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they take
back ’ the hideous orc-head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down
and broken in pieces  and the old king’s head was raised and set in its place
once more  still crowned with white and golden flowers  and men laboured to wash
and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone 
now in their debate some had counselled that minas morgul should first be
assailed  and if they might take it  it should be utterly destroyed  ‘and 
maybe ’ said imrahil  ‘the road that leads thence to the pass above will
prove an easier way of assault upon the dark lord than his northern gate ’
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently  because of the evil that dwelt
in the valley  where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror 
and because also of the news that faramir had brought  for if the ring-bearer
had indeed attempted that way  then above all they should not draw the eye of
mordor thither  so the next day when the main host came up  they set a strong
guard upon the cross-roads to make some defence  if mordor should send a force
over the morgul pass  or should bring more men up from the south  for that guard
they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the
woods and slopes about the meeting of the ways  but gandalf and aragorn rode
with the vanguard to the entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city 
it was dark and lifeless  for the orcs and lesser creatures of mordor that
had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle  and
the nazgûl were abroad  yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and
enmity  then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields
and departed 
the day after  being the third day since they set out from minas tirith  the
army began its northward march along the road  it was some hundred miles by that
way from the cross-roads to the morannon  and what might befall them before they
came so far none knew they went openly but heedfully  with mounted
scouts before them on the road  and others on foot upon either side  especially
on the eastward flank  for there lay dark thickets  and a tumbled land of rocky
ghylls and crags  behind which the long grim slopes of the ephel dúath
clambered up  the weather of the world remained fair and the wind held in
the west  but nothing could waft away the glooms and the sad mists that clung
about the mountains of shadow  and behind them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds 
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets  and the heralds would cry 
“the lords of gondor are come  let all leave this land or yield them up ’
but imrahil said  ‘say not the lords of gondor  say the king elessar 
for that is true  even though he has not yet sat upon the throne  and it will
give the enemy more thought  if the heralds use that name ’ and thereafter
thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the king elessar  but none
answered the challenge 
nonetheless  though they marched in seeming peace  the hearts of all the
army  from the highest to the lowest  were downcast  and with every mile that
they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them  it was near the end of
the second day of their march from the cross-roads that they first met any offer
of battle  for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to take their
leading companies in an ambush  and that was in the very place where faramir had
waylaid the men of harad  and the road went in a deep cutting through an
out-thrust of the eastward hills  but the captains
of the west were well warned by their scouts  skilled men from henneth annûn
led by mablung  and so the ambush was itself trapped  for horsemen went wide
about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind  and
they were destroyed or driven east into the hills 
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains  ‘it is but a
feint ’ said aragorn  ‘and its chief purpose  i deem  was rather to draw us
on by a false guess of our enemy’s weakness than to do us much
hurt  yet ’ and from that evening onward the nazgûl came and followed
every move of the army  they still flew high and out of sight of all save
legolas  and yet their presence could be felt  as a deepening of shadow and a
dimming of the sun  and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent  uttering no cry  the dread of them could not be
shaken off 
so time and the hopeless journey wore away  upon the fourth day from the
cross-roads and the sixth from minas tirith they came at last to the end of the
living lands  and began to pass into the desolation that lay before the gates of
the pass of cirith gorgor  and they could descry the marshes and the desert that
stretched north and west to the emyn muil  so desolate were those places and so
deep the horror that lay on them that some of the host were unmanned  and they
could neither walk nor ride further north 
aragorn looked at them  and there was pity in his eyes rather than wrath  for
these were young men from rohan  from westfold far away  or husbandmen from
lossarnach  and to them mordor had been from childhood a name of evil  and yet
unreal  a legend that had no part in their simple life  and now they walked like
men in a hideous dream made true  and they understood not this war nor why fate
should lead them to such a pass 
‘go ’ said aragorn  ‘but keep what honour you may  and do not run  and
there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed  take your way
south-west till you come to cair andros  and if that is still held by enemies 
as i think  then re-take it  if you can  and hold it to the last in defence of
gondor and rohan ’
then some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on  and the
others took new hope  hearing of a manful deed within their measure that they
could turn to  and they departed  and so  since many men had already been left
at the cross-roads  it was with less than six thousands that the captains of the
west came at last to challenge the black gate and the might of mordor 
they advanced now slowly  expecting at every hour some answer to their
challenge  and they drew together  since it was but waste of men to send out
scouts or small parties from the main host  at nightfall of the fifth day of the
march from morgul vale they made their last camp  and set fires about it of such
dead wood and heath as they could find  they passed the hours of night in
wakefulness and they were aware of many things half-seen that walked and prowled
all about them  and they heard the howling of wolves  the wind had died and all
the air seemed still  they could see little  for though it was cloudless and the
waxing moon was four nights old  there were smokes and fumes that rose out of
the earth and the white crescent was shrouded in the mists of mordor 
it grew cold  as morning came the wind began to stir again  but now it came
from the north  and soon it freshened to a rising breeze  all the night-walkers
were gone  and the land seemed empty  north amid their noisome pits lay the
first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and blasted earth 
the vomit of the maggot-folk of mordor  but south and now near loomed the great
rampart of cirith gorgor  and the black gate amidmost  and the two towers of the
teeth tall and dark upon either side  for in their last march the captains had
turned away from the old road as it bent east  and avoided the peril of the
lurking hills  and so now they were approaching the morannon from the
north-west  even as frodo had done 
the two vast iron doors of the black gate under its frowning arch were fast
closed  upon the battlement nothing could be seen  all was silent but watchful 
they were come to the last end of their folly  and stood forlorn and chill in
the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their army could not
assault with hope  not even if it had brought thither engines of great power 
and the enemy had no more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate
and wall alone  yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about the morannon
were filled with hidden foes  and the shadowy defile beyond was bored and
tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things  and as they stood they saw all the
nazgûl gathered together  hovering above the towers of the teeth like
vultures  and they knew that they were watched  but still the enemy made
no sign 
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end  therefore aragorn
now set the host in such array as could best be contrived  and they were drawn
up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of
labour  before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud
and foul-smelling pools  when all was ordered  the captains rode forth towards
the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds
and trumpeters  there was gandalf as chief herald  and aragorn with the sons of
elrond  and éomer of rohan  and imrahil  and legolas and gimli and
peregrin were bidden to go also  so that all the enemies of mordor should have a
witness 
they came within cry of the morannon  and unfurled the banner  and blew upon
their trumpets  and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the
battlement of mordor 
‘come forth ’ they cried  ‘let the lord of the black land come forth 
justice shall be done upon him  for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and
wrested its lands  therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone for
his evils  and depart then for ever  come forth ’
there was a long silence  and from wall and gate no cry or sound was heard in
answer  but sauron had already laid his plans  and he had a mind first to play
these mice cruelly before he struck to kill  so it was that  even as the
captains were about to turn away  the silence was broken suddenly  there came a
long rolling of great drums like thunder in the mountains  and then a braying of
horns that shook the very stones and stunned men’s ears  and thereupon the
middle door of the black gate was thrown open with a great clang  and out of it
there came an embassy from the dark tower 
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape  mounted upon a black horse  if
horse it was  for it was huge and hideous  and its face was a frightful mask 
more like a skull than a living head  and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flame  the rider was robed
all in black  and black was his lofty helm  yet this was no ringwraith but a
living man  the lieutenant of the tower of barad-dûr he was  and his name
is remembered in no tale  for he himself had forgotten it  and he said  ‘i am
the mouth of sauron ’ but it is told that he was a renegade  who came of the
race of those that are named the black númenóreans  for they
established their dwellings in middle-earth during the years of sauron’s
domination  and they worshipped him  being enamoured of evil knowledge 
and he entered the service of the dark tower when it first rose again  and
because of his cunning he grew ever higher in the lord’s favour  and he
learned great sorcery  and knew much of the mind of sauron  and he was more
cruel than any orc 
he it was that now rode out  and with him came only a small company of
black-harnessed soldiery  and a single banner  black but bearing on it in red
the evil eye  now halting a few paces before the captains of the west he looked
them up and down and laughed 
‘is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me ’ he asked 
‘or indeed with wit to understand me  not thou at least ’ he mocked  turning
to aragorn with scorn  ‘it needs more to make a king than a piece of elvish
glass  or a rabble such as this  why  any brigand of the hills can show as good
a following ’
aragorn said naught in answer  but he took the other’s eye and held it  and
for a moment they strove thus  but soon  though aragorn did not stir nor move
hand to weapon  the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow  ‘i
am a herald and ambassador  and may not be assailed ’ he cried 
‘where such laws hold ’ said gandalf  ‘it is also the custom for
ambassadors to use less insolence  but no one has threatened you  you have
naught to fear from us  until your errand is done  but unless your master has
come to new wisdom  then with all his servants you will be in great peril ’
‘so ’ said the messenger  ‘then thou art the spokesman  old greybeard 
have we not heard of thee at whiles  and of thy wanderings  ever hatching plots
and mischief at a safe distance  but this time thou hast stuck out thy nose too
far  master gandalf  and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets his foolish
webs before the feet of sauron the great  i have tokens that i was bidden to
show to thee - to thee in especial  if thou shouldst dare to come ’ he signed
to one of his guards  and he came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black
cloths 
the messenger put these aside  and there to the wonder and dismay of all the
captains he held up first the short sword that sam had carried  and next a grey
cloak with an elven-brooch  and last the coat of mithril-mail that frodo had
worn wrapped in his tattered garments  a blackness came before their eyes  and
it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the world stood still  but their
hearts were dead and their last hope gone  pippin who stood behind prince
imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief 
‘silence ’ said gandalf sternly  thrusting him back  but the messenger
laughed aloud 
‘so you have yet another of these imps with you ’ he cried  ‘what use
you find in them i cannot guess  but to send them as spies into mordor is beyond
even your accustomed folly  still  i thank him  for it is plain that this brat
at least has seen these tokens before  and it would be vain for you to deny them
now ’
‘i do not wish to deny them ’ said gandalf  ‘indeed  i know them all
and all their history  and despite your scorn  foul mouth of sauron  you cannot
say as much  but why do you bring them here ’
‘dwarf-coat  elf-cloak  blade of the downfallen west  and spy from the
little rat-land of the shire-nay  do not start  we know it well - here are the
marks of a conspiracy  now  maybe he that bore these things was a creature that
you would not grieve to lose  and maybe otherwise  one dear to you  perhaps  if
so  take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you  for sauron does not
love spies  and what his fate shall be depends now on your choice ’
no one answered him  but he saw their faces grey with fear and the horror in
their eyes  and he laughed again  for it seemed to him that his sport went well 
‘good  good ’ he said  ‘he was dear to you  i see  or else his errand was
one that you did not wish to fail  it has  and now he shall endure the slow
torment of years  as long and slow as our arts in the great tower can contrive 
and never be released  unless maybe when he is changed and broken  so that he
may come to you  and you shall see what you have done  this shall surely
be-unless you accept my lord’s terms ’
‘name the terms ’ said gandalf steadily  but those nearby saw the anguish
in his face  and now he seemed an old and wizened man  crushed  defeated at
last  they did not doubt that he would accept 
‘these are the terms ’ said the messenger  and smiled as he eyed them one
by one  ‘the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at once
beyond the anduin  first taking oaths never again to assail sauron the great in
arms  open or secret  all lands east of anduin shall be sauron’s for ever 
solely  west of the anduin as far as the misty mountains and the gap of rohan
shall be tributary to mordor  and men there shall bear no weapons  but shall
have leave to govern their own affairs  but they shall help to rebuild isengard
which they have wantonly destroyed  and that shall be sauron’s  and there his
lieutenant shall dwell  not saruman  but one more worthy of trust ’
looking in the messenger’s eyes they read his thought  he was to be that
lieutenant  and gather all that remained of the west under his sway  he would be
their tyrant and they his slaves 
but gandalf said  ‘this is much to demand for the delivery of one servant 
that your master should receive in exchange what he must else fight many a war
to gain  or has the field of gondor destroyed his hope in war  so that he falls
to haggling  and if indeed we rated this prisoner so high  what surety have we
that sauron the base master of treachery  will keep his part  where is this
prisoner  let him be brought forth and yielded to us  and then we will consider
these demands ’
it seemed then to gandalf  intent  watching him as a man engaged in fencing
with a deadly foe  that for the taking of a breath the messenger was at a loss 
yet swiftly he laughed again 
‘do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron ’ he
cried  ‘surety you crave  sauron gives none  if you sue for his clemency you
must first do his bidding  these are his terms  take them or leave them ’
‘these we will take ’ said gandalf suddenly  he cast aside his cloak and
a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place  before his upraised
hand the foul messenger recoiled  and gandalf coming seized and took from him
the tokens  coat  cloak  and sword  ‘these we will take in memory of our
friend ’ he cried  ‘but as for your terms  we reject them utterly  get you
gone  for your embassy is over and death is near to you  we did not come here to
waste words in treating with sauron  faithless and accursed  still less with one
of his slaves  begone ’
then the messenger of mordor laughed no more  his face was twisted with
amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that  as it crouches on
its prey  is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod  rage filled him and his
mouth slavered  and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from his throat 
but he looked at the fell faces of the captains and their deadly eyes  and fear
overcame his wrath  he gave a great cry  and turned  leaped upon his steed  and
with his company galloped madly back to cirith gorgor  but as they went his
soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged  and even before they came to
the gate sauron sprang his trap 
drums rolled and fires leaped up  the great doors of the black gate swung
back wide  out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirling waters when a
sluice is lifted 
the captains mounted again and rode back  and from the host of mordor there
went up a jeering yell  dust rose smothering the air  as from nearby there
marched up an army of easterlings that had waited for the signal in the shadows
of ered lithui beyond the further tower  down from the hills on either side of
the morannon poured orcs innumerable  the men of the west were trapped  and
soon  all about the grey mounds where they stood  forces ten times and more than
ten times their match would ring them in a sea of enemies  sauron had taken the
proffered bait in jaws of steel 
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle  upon the one
hill he stood with gandalf  and there fair and desperate was raised the banner
of the tree and stars  upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of rohan
and dol amroth  white horse and silver swan  and about each hill a ring was made
facing all ways  bristling with spear and sword  but
in the front towards mordor where the first bitter assault would come there
stood the sons of elrond on the left with the dúnedain about them  and on
the right the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth tall and fair  and
picked men of the tower of guard 
the wind blew  and the trumpets sang  and arrows whined  but the sun now
climbing towards the south was veiled in the reeks of mordor  and through a
threatening haze it gleamed  remote  a sullen red  as if it were the ending of
the day  or the end maybe of all the world of
light  and out of the gathering mirk the nazgûl came with  their cold
voices crying words of death  and then all hope was quenched 
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf reject the terms
and doom frodo to the torment of the tower  but he had mastered himself  and now
he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil’s men  for
it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life  since
all was in ruin 
‘i wish merry was here ’ he heard himself saying  and quick thoughts
raced through his mind  even as he watched the enemy come charging to the
assault  ‘well  well  now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little
better  we might die together  merry and i  and since die we must  why not 
well  as he is not here  i hope he’ll find an easier end  but now i must do my
best ’
he drew his sword and looked at it  and the intertwining shapes of red and
gold  and the flowing characters of númenor glinted like fire upon the
blade  ‘this was made for just such an hour ’ he thought  ‘if only
i could smite that foul messenger with it  then almost i should draw level with
old merry  well  i’ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end  i wish
i could see cool sunlight and green grass again ’
then even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them  the
orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and poured their
arrows into the defending ranks  but through them there came striding up 
roaring like beasts  a great company of hill-trolls out of gorgoroth  taller and
broader than men they were  and they were clad only in close-fitting mesh of
horny scales  or maybe that was their hideous hide  but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands  reckless they
sprang into the pools and waded across  bellowing as they came  like a storm
they broke upon the line of the men of gondor  and beat upon helm and head  and
arm and shield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron  at pippin’s side
beregond was stunned and overborne  and he fell  and the great troll-chief that
smote him down bent over him  reaching out a clutching claw  for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down 
then pippin stabbed upwards  and the written blade of westernesse pierced
through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll  and his black blood
came gushing out  he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock 
burying those beneath him  blackness and stench and crushing pain came upon
pippin  and his mind fell away into a great darkness 
‘so it ends as i guessed it would ’ his thought said  even as it
fluttered away  and it laughed a little within him ere it fled  almost gay it
seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear  and then even as
it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices  and they seemed to be crying
in some forgotten world far above 
‘the eagles are coming  the eagles are coming ’
for one moment more pippin’s thought hovered  ‘bilbo ’ it said  ‘but
no  that came in his tale  long long ago  this is my tale  and it is ended now 
good-bye ’ and his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more 
 
 
 
sam roused himself painfully from the ground  for a moment he wondered where
he was  and then all the misery and despair returned to him  he was in the deep
dark outside the under-gate of the orcs  stronghold  its brazen doors were shut 
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them  but how long he
had lain there he did not know  then he had been on fire  desperate and furious 
now he was shivering and cold  he crept to the doors and pressed his ears
against them 
far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamouring  but soon they
stopped or passed out of hearing  and all was still  his head ached and his eyes
saw phantom lights in the darkness  but he struggled to steady himself and
think  it was clear at any rate that he had no hope of getting into the orc-hold
by that gate  he might wait there for days before it was opened  and he could
not wait  time was desperately precious  he no longer had any doubt about his
duty  he must rescue his master or perish in the attempt 
‘the perishing is more likely  and will be a lot easier anyway ’ he said
grimly to himself  as he sheathed sting and turned from the brazen doors  slowly
he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel  not daring to use the
elven-light  and as he went he tried to fit together the events since frodo and
he had left the cross-roads  he wondered what the time was  somewhere between
one day and the next  he supposed  but even of the days he had quite lost count 
he was in a land of darkness where the days of the world seemed forgotten  and
where all who entered were forgotten too 
‘i wonder if they think of us at all ’ he said  ‘and what is happening
to them all away there ’ he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him  but
he was in fact now facing southwards  as he came back to shelob’s tunnel  not
west  out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day
of march in the shire-reckoning  and even now aragorn was leading the black
fleet from pelargir  and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain
valley  while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness
growing in the eyes of denethor  yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts
of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam  they were not forgotten 
but they were far beyond aid  and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise
hamfast’s son  he was utterly alone 


he came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage  and still unable to
discover the catch or bolt that held it  he scrambled over as before and dropped
softly to the ground  then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelob’s tunnel  where the rags of her great web were still blowing and
swaying in the cold airs  for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind  but the breath of them revived him  he crept cautiously out 
all was ominously quiet  the light was no more than that of dusk at a dark
day’s end  the vast vapours that arose in mordor and went streaming westward
passed low overhead  a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath
with a sullen glow of red 
sam looked up towards the orc-tower  and suddenly from its narrow windows
lights stared out like small red eyes  he wondered if they were some signal  his
fear of the orcs  forgotten for a while in his wrath and desperation  now
returned  as far as he could see  there was only one possible course for him to
take  he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower  but
his knees felt weak  and he found that he was trembling  drawing his eyes down
from the tower and the horns of the cleft before him  he forced his unwilling
feet to obey him  and slowly  listening with all his ears  peering into the
dense shadows of the rocks beside the way  he retraced his steps  past the place
where frodo fell  and still the stench of shelob lingered  and then on and up 
until he stood again in the very cleft where he had put on the ring and seen
shagrat’s company go by 
there he halted and sat down  for the moment he could drive himself no
further  he felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took one
step veritably down into the land of mordor  that step would be irrevocable  he
could never come back  without any clear purpose he drew out the ring and put it
on again  immediately he felt the great burden of its weight  and felt afresh 
but now more strong and urgent than ever  the malice of the eye of mordor 
searching  trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own defence 
but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt 
as before  sam found that his hearing was sharpened  but that to his sight
the things of this world seemed thin and vague  the rocky walls of the path were
pale  as if seen through a mist  but still at a distance he heard the bubbling
of shelob in her misery  and harsh and clear  and very close it seemed  he heard
cries and the clash of metal  he sprang to his feet  and pressed himself against
the wall beside the road  he was glad of the ring  for here was yet another
company of orcs on the march  or so at first he thought  then suddenly he
realized that it was not so  his hearing had deceived him  the orc-cries came
from the tower  whose topmost horn was now right above him  on the left hand of
the cleft 
sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move  there was plainly some
devilry going on  perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had
mastered them  and they were tormenting frodo  or even savagely hacking him to
pieces  he listened  and as he did a gleam of hope came to him  there could not
be much doubt  there was fighting in the tower  the orcs must be at war among
themselves  shagrat and gorbag had come to blows  faint as was the hope that his
guess brought him  it was enough to rouse him  there might be just a chance  his
love for frodo rose above all other thoughts  and forgetting his peril he cried
aloud  ‘i’m coming  mr  frodo ’
he ran forward to the climbing path  and over it  at once the road turned
left and plunged steeply down  sam had crossed into mordor 


he took off the ring  moved it may be by some deep premonition of danger  though
to himself he thought only that he wished to see more clearly  `better have a
look at the worst ’ he muttered  `no good blundering about in a fog ’
hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze  before his feet the
highest ridge of the ephel dúath fell
steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough  on the further side of which
there rose another ridge  much lower  its edge notched and jagged with crags
like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them  it was
the grim morgai  the inner ring of the fences of the land  far beyond it  but
almost straight ahead  across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires 
there was a great burning glow  and from it rose in huge columns a swirling
smoke  dusty red at the roots  black above where it merged into the billowing
canopy that roofed in all the accursed land 
sam was looking at orodruin  the mountain of fire  ever and anon the furnaces
far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides  some would flow
blazing towards barad-dûr down great channels  some would wind their way
into the stony plain  until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes
vomited from the tormented earth  in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount
doom  and the light of it  cut off by the high screen of the ephel dúath
from those who climbed up the path from the west  now glared against the stark
rock faces  so that they seemed to be drenched with blood 
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast  for now  looking to his left  he
could see the tower of cirith ungol in all its strength  the horn that he had
seen from the other side was only its topmost turret  its eastern face stood up
in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far below  its back was
to a great cliff behind  from which it jutted out in pointed bastions  one above
the other  diminishing as they rose  with sheer sides of cunning masonry that
looked north-east and south-east  about the lowest tier  two hundred feet below
where sam now stood  there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court  its
gate  upon the near south-eastern side  opened on a broad road  the outer
parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice  until
it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness to join the road
that came over the morgul pass  then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad-dûr  the narrow
upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path
to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to the tower-gate 
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood  almost with a shock  that this
stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of mordor  but to keep them
in  it was indeed one of the works of gondor long ago  an eastern outpost of the
defences of ithilien  made when  after the last alliance  men of westernesse
kept watch on the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurked  but as
with narchost and carchost  the towers of the teeth  so here too the vigilance
had failed  and treachery had yielded up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths  and now for long years it had been held by evil things  since his
return to mordor  sauron had found it useful  for he had few servants but many
slaves of fear  and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from
mordor  though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly 
then it was also a last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the
vigilance of morgul and of shelob 
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under
those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate  and even if he did so  he
could not go far on the guarded road beyond  not even the black shadows  lying
deep where the red glow could not reach  would shield him long from the
night-eyed orcs  but desperate as that road might be  his task was now far
worse  not to avoid the gate and escape  but to enter it  alone 


his thought turned to the ring  but there was no comfort there  only dread and
danger  no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom  burning far away  than he
was aware of a change in his burden  as it drew near the great furnaces where 
in the deeps of time  it had been shaped and forged  the ring’s power grew 
and it became more fell  untameable save by some mighty will  as sam stood
there  even though the ring was not on him but hanging by its chain about his
neck  he felt himself enlarged  as if he were robed in a huge distorted shadow
of himself  a vast and ominous threat halted upon the walls of mordor  he felt
that he had from now on only two choices  to forbear the ring  though it would
torment him  or to claim it  and challenge the power that sat in its dark hold
beyond the valley of shadows  already the ring tempted him  gnawing at his will
and reason  wild fantasies arose in his mind  and he saw samwise the strong 
hero of the age  striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land  and
armies flocking to his call as he marched to the
overthrow of barad-dûr  and then all the clouds rolled away  and the white
sun shone  and at his command the vale of gorgoroth became a garden of flowers
and trees and brought forth fruit  he had only to put on the ring and
claim it for his own  and all this could be 
in that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold
him firm  but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain
hobbit-sense  he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to
bear such a burden  even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him 
the one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due  not a garden
swollen to a realm  his own hands to use  not the hands of others to command 
‘and anyway all these notions are only a trick ’ he said to himself 
‘he’d spot me and cow me  before i could so much as shout out  he’d spot
me  pretty quick  if i put the ring on now  in mordor  well  all i can say is 
things look as hopeless as a frost in spring  just when being invisible would be
really useful  i can’t use the ring  and if ever i get any further  it’s
going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step  so what’s to be
done ’
he was not really in any doubt  he knew that he must go down to the gate and
not linger any more  with a shrug of his shoulders  as if to shake off the
shadow and dismiss the phantoms  he began slowly to descend  with each step he
seemed to diminish  he had not gone far before he had shrunk again to a very
small and frightened hobbit  he was now passing under the very walls of the
tower  and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard with his unaided
ears  at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the court behind the
outer wall 


sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red
glow there came two orcs running  they did not turn towards him  they were
making for the main road  but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the
ground and lay still  sam had seen no arrows  but he guessed that the orcs had
been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate 
he went on  hugging the wall on his left  one look upward had shown him that
there was no hope of climbing it  the stone-work rose thirty feet  without a
crack or ledge  to overhanging courses like inverted steps  the gate was the
only way 
he crept on  and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived in the tower with
shagrat  and how many gorbag had  and what they were quarrelling about  if that
was what was happening  shagrat’s company had seemed to be about forty  and
gorbag’s more than twice as large  but of course shagrat’s patrol had only
been a part of his garrison  almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo 
and the spoil  for a second sam halted  for suddenly things seemed clear to him 
almost as if he had seen them with his eyes  the mithril coat  of course  frodo
was wearing it  and they would find it  and from what sam had heard gorbag would
covet it  but the orders of the dark tower were at present frodo’s only
protection  and if they were set aside  frodo might be killed out of hand at any
moment 
‘come on  you miserable sluggard ’ sam cried to himself  `now for it ’
he drew sting and ran towards the open gate  but just as he was about to pass
under its great arch he felt a shock  as if he had run into some web like
shelob’s  only invisible  he could see no obstacle  but something too strong
for his will to overcome barred the way  he looked about  and then within the
shadow of the gate he saw the two watchers 
they were like great figures seated upon thrones  each had three joined
bodies  and three heads facing outward  and inward  and across the gateway  the
heads had vulture-faces  and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands  they
seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone  immovable  and yet they were
aware  some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them  they knew an enemy 
visible or invisible none could pass unheeded  they would forbid his entry  or
his escape 
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again  and halted with a jerk 
staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head  then greatly daring 
because he could think of nothing else to do  answering a sudden thought that
came to him  he drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up  its white
light quickened swiftly  and the shadows under the dark arch fled  the monstrous
watchers sat there cold and still  revealed in all their hideous shape  for a
moment sam caught a glitter in the black stones of their eyes  the very malice
of which made him quail  but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into
fear 
he sprang past them  but even as he did so  thrusting the phial back into his
bosom  he was aware  as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to behind him 
that their vigilance was renewed  and from those evil heads there came a high
shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him  far up above  like an
answering signal  a harsh bell clanged a single stroke 


‘that’s done it ’ said sam  `now i’ve rung the front-door bell  well 
come on somebody ’ he cried  `tell captain shagrat that the great elf-warrior
has called  with his elf-sword too ’
there was no answer  sam strode forward  sting glittered blue in his hand 
the courtyard lay in deep shadow  but he could see that the pavement was strewn
with bodies  right at his feet were two orc-archers with knives sticking in
their backs  beyond lay many more shapes  some singly as they had been hewn down
or shot  others in pairs  still grappling one another  dead in the very throes
of stabbing  throttling  biting  the stones were slippery with dark blood 
two liveries sam noticed  one marked by the red eye  the other by a moon
disfigured with a ghastly face of death  but he did not stop to look more
closely  across the court a great door at the foot of the tower stood half open 
and a red light came through  a large orc lay dead upon the threshold  sam
sprang over the body and went in  and then he peered about at a loss 
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain-side 
it was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the walls  but its distant
end was lost in gloom  many doors and openings could be seen on this side and
that  but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor 
from what he had heard of the captains’ talk sam knew that  dead or alive 
frodo would most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above 
but he might search for a day before he found the way 
‘it’ll be near the back  i guess ’ sam muttered  `the whole tower
climbs backwards-like  and anyway i’d better follow these lights ’
he advanced down the passage  but slowly now  each step more reluctant 
terror was beginning to grip him again  there was no sound save the rap of his
feet  which seemed to grow to an echoing noise  like the slapping of great hands
upon the stones  the dead bodies  the emptiness  the dank black walls that in
the torchlight seemed to drip with blood  the fear of sudden death lurking in
doorway or shadow  and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the
gate  it was almost more than he could screw himself to face  he would have
welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time - rather than this hideous
brooding uncertainty  he forced himself to think of frodo  lying bound or in
pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place  he went on 
he had passed beyond the torchlight  almost to a great arched door at the end
of the passage  the inner side of the under gate  as he rightly guessed  when
there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek  he stopped short  then he
heard feet coming  someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway
overhead 
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand  it dragged at the chain
and clutched the ring  but sam did not put it on  for even as he clasped it to
his breast  an orc came clattering down  leaping out of a dark opening at the
right  it ran towards him  it was no more than six paces from him when  lifting
its head  it saw him  and sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in
its bloodshot eyes  it stopped short aghast  for what it saw was not a small
frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword  it saw a great silent shape 
cloaked in a grey shadow  looming against the wavering light behind  in one hand
it held a sword  the very light of which was a bitter pain  the other was
clutched at its breast  but held concealed some nameless menace of power and
doom 
for a moment the orc crouched  and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned
and fled back as it had come  never was any dog more heartened when its enemy
turned tail than sam at this unexpected flight  with a shout he gave chase 
`yes  the elf-warrior is loose ’ he cried  ‘i’m coming  just you show
me the way up  or i’ll skin you ’
but the orc was in its own haunts  nimble and well-fed  sam was a stranger 
hungry and weary  the stairs were high and steep and winding  sam’s breath
began to come in gasps  the orc had soon passed out of sight  and now only
faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on and up  every now
and again it gave a yell  and the echo ran along the walls  but slowly all sound
of it died away 
sam plodded on  he felt that he was on the right road  and his spirits had
risen a good deal  he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt  `well 
well ’ he said  `if only they all take such a dislike to me and my sting  this
may turn out better than i hoped  and anyway it looks as if shagrat  gorbag  and
company have done nearly all my job for me  except for that little frightened
rat  i do believe there’s nobody left alive in the place ’
and with that he stopped  brought up hard  as if he had hit his head against
the stone wall  the full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow 
nobody left alive  whose had been that horrible dying shriek  `frodo  frodo 
master ’ he cried half sobbing  ‘if they’ve killed you  what shall i do 
well  i’m coming at last  right to the top  to see what i must ’


up  up he went  it was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a turn  or
beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the tower  sam tried to
count the steps  but after two hundred he lost his reckoning  he was moving
quietly now  for he thought that he could hear the sound of voices talking 
still some way above  more than one rat remained alive  it seemed 
all at once  when he felt that he could pump out no more breath  nor force
his knees to bend again  the stair ended  he stood still  the voices were now
loud and near  sam peered about  he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third and highest tier of the tower  an open space  about twenty yards across 
with a low parapet  there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the
midst of the roof  with low doors facing east and west  eastward sam could see
the plain of mordor vast and dark below  and the burning mountain far away  a
fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells  and the rivers of fire blazed so
fiercely that even at this distance of many miles the light of them lit the
tower-top with a red glare  westward the view was blocked by the base of the
great turret that stood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high
above the crest of the encircling hills  light gleamed in a window-slit  its
door was not ten yards from where sam stood  it was open but dark  and from just
within its shadow the voices came 
at first sam did not listen  he took a pace out of the eastward door and
looked about  at once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest  all
the court was choked with dead orcs or their severed and scattered heads and
limbs  the place stank of death  a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent him
darting back into hiding  an orc-voice rose in anger  and he knew it again at
once  harsh  brutal  cold  it was shagrat speaking  captain of the tower 
`you won’t go again  you say  curse you  snaga  you little maggot  if you
think i’m so damaged that it’s safe to flout me  you’re mistaken come
here  and i’ll squeeze your eyes out  like i did to radbug just now  and when
some new lads come  i’ll deal with you  i’ll send you to shelob ’
`they won’t come  not before you’re dead anyway ’ answered snaga
surlily  ‘i’ve told you twice that gorbag’s swine got to the gate first 
and none of ours got out  lagduf and muzgash ran through  but they were shot  i
saw it from a window  i tell you  and they were the last ’
‘then you must go  i must stay here anyway  but i’m hurt  the black pits
take that filthy rebel gorbag ’ shagrat’s voice trailed off into a
string of foul names and curses  `i gave him better than i got  but he knifed
me  the dung  before i throttled him  you must go  or i’ll eat you  news must
get through to lugbúrz  or we’ll both be for the black pits  yes  you
too  you won’t escape by skulking here ’
`i’m not going down those stairs again ’ growled snaga  `be you captain
or no  nar  keep your hands off your knife  or i’ll put an arrow in your guts 
you won’t be a captain long when they hear about all these goings-on  i’ve
fought for the tower against those stinking morgul-rats  but a nice mess you two
precious captains have made of things  fighting over the swag ’
‘that’s enough from you ’ snarled shagrat  `i had my orders  it was
gorbag started it  trying to pinch that pretty shirt ’
`well  you put his back up  being so high and mighty  and he had more sense
than you anyway  he told you more than once that the most dangerous of these
spies was still loose  and you wouldn’t listen  and you won’t listen now 
gorbag was right  i tell you  there’s a great fighter about  one of those
bloody-handed elves  or one of the filthy tarks 1 he’s coming here  i
tell you  you heard the bell  he’s got past the watchers  and that’s tark’s
work  he’s on the stairs  and until he’s off them  i’m not going down 
not if you were a nazgûl  i wouldn’t ’
`so that’s it  is it ’ yelled shagrat  ‘you’ll do this  and you’ll
not do that  and when he does come  you’ll bolt and leave me  no  you won’t 
i’ll put red maggot-holes in your belly first ’
out of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying  behind him came shagrat 
a large orc with long arms that  as he ran crouching  reached to the ground  but
one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding  the other hugged a large black
bundle  in the red glare sam  cowering behind the stair-door  caught a glimpse
of his evil face as it passed  it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared
with blood  slaver dripped from its protruding fangs  the mouth snarled like an
animal 
as far as sam could see  shagrat hunted snaga round the roof  until ducking
and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and
disappeared  then shagrat halted  out of the eastward door sam could see him now
by the parapet  panting  his left claw clenching and unclenching feebly  he put
the bundle on the floor and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and
spat on it  going to the parapet he leaned over  looking down into the outer
court far below  twice he shouted but no answer came 
suddenly  as shagrat was stooped over the battlement  his back to the
roof-top  sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was moving 
it was crawling  it put out a claw and clutched the bundle  it staggered up  in
its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short broken haft  it was
poised for a stabbing thrust  but at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth 
a gasp of pain or hate  quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside  twisted round 
and drove his knife into his enemy’s throat 
`got you  gorbag ’ he cried  ‘not quite dead  eh  well  i’ll finish my
job now ’ he sprang on to the fallen body  and stamped and trampled it in his
fury  stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife  satisfied at
last  he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph 
then he licked his knife  and put it between his teeth  and catching up the
bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs 
sam had no time to think  he might have slipped out of the other door  but
hardly without being seen  and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this
hideous orc for long  he did what was probably the best thing he could have
done  he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout  he was no longer holding the
ring  but it was there  a hidden power  a cowing menace to the slaves of mordor 
and in his hand was sting  and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the
glitter of cruel stars in the terrible elf-countries  the dream of which was a
cold fear to all his kind  and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his
treasure  he stopped  growling  baring his fangs  then once more  orc-fashion 
he leapt aside  and as sam sprang at him  using the heavy bundle as both shield
and weapon  he thrust it hard into his enemy’s face  sam staggered  and before
he could recover  shagrat darted past and down the stairs 
sam ran after him  cursing  but he did not go far  soon the thought of frodo
returned to him  and he remembered that the other orc had gone back into the
turret  here was another dreadful choice  and he had no time to ponder it  if
shagrat got away  he would soon get help and come back  but if sam pursued him 
the other orc might do some horrible deed up there  and anyway sam might miss
shagrat or be killed by him  he turned quickly and ran back up the stairs 
`wrong again  i expect ’ he sighed  `but it’s my job to go right up to the
top first  whatever happens afterwards ’
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and
through the gate  bearing his precious burden  if sam could have seen him and
known the grief that his escape would bring  he might have quailed  but now his
mind was set on the last stage of his search  he came cautiously to the
turret-door and stepped inside  it opened into darkness  but soon his staring
eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand  it came from an opening that
led to another stairway  dark and narrow  it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outer wall  a torch was glimmering from
somewhere up above 
softly sam began to climb  he came to the guttering torch  fixed above a door
on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward  one of the red eyes
that he and frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel’s mouth  quickly sam
passed the door and hurried on to the second storey  dreading at any moment to
he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind  he came
next to a window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage
through the middle of the turret  the door was open  the passage dark save for
the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the
window-slit  but here the stair stopped and climbed no further  sam crept into
the passage  on either side there was a low door  both were closed and locked 
there was no sound at all 
`a dead end ’ muttered sam  `and after all my climb  this can’t be the
top of the tower  but what can i do now ’
he ran back to the lower storey and tried the door  it would not move  he ran
up again  and sweat began to trickle down his face  he felt that even minutes
were precious  but one by one they escaped  and he could do nothing  he cared no
longer for shagrat or snaga or any other orc that was ever spawned  he longed
only for his master  for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand 
at last  weary and feeling finally defeated  he sat on a step below the level
of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands  it was quiet  horribly
quiet  the torch  that was already burning low when he arrived  sputtered and
went out  and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide  and then softly  to
his own surprise  there at the vain end of his long journey and his grief  moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell  sam began to sing 
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower  the voice of a
forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the
clear song of an elven-lord  he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire 
and snatches of mr  bilbo’s rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting
glimpses of the country of his home  and then suddenly new strength rose in him 
and his voice rang out  while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple
tune 
in western lands beneath the sun

the flowers may rise in spring 

the trees may bud  the waters run 

the merry finches sing 

or there maybe ‘tis cloudless night

and swaying beeches bear

the elven-stars as jewels white

amid their branching hair 



though here at journey’s end i lie

in darkness buried deep 

beyond all towers strong and high 

beyond all mountains steep 

above all shadows rides the sun

and stars for ever dwell 

i will not say the day is done 

nor bid the stars farewell 
`beyond all towers strong and high ’ he began again  and then he stopped
short  he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him  but now he
could hear nothing  yes  he could hear something  but not a voice  footsteps
were approaching  now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above  the
hinges creaked  sam crouched down listening  the door closed with a dull thud 
and then a snarling orc-voice rang out 
‘ho la  you up there  you dunghill rat  stop your squeaking  or i’ll come
and deal with you  d’you hear ’
there was no answer 
‘all right ’ growled snaga  `but i’ll come and have a look at you all
the same  and see what you’re up to ’
the hinges creaked again  and sam  now peering over the corner of the
passage-threshold  saw a flicker of light in an open doorway  and the dim shape
of an orc coming out  he seemed to be carrying a ladder  suddenly the answer
dawned on sam  the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in the roof of the
passage  snaga thrust the ladder upwards  steadied it  and then clambered out of
sight  sam heard a bolt drawn back  then he heard the hideous voice speaking
again 
`you lie quiet  or you’ll pay for it  you’ve not got long to live in
peace  i guess  but if you don’t want the fun to begin right now  keep your
trap shut  see  there’s a reminder for you ’ there was a sound like the
crack of a whip 
at that rage blazed in sam’s heart to a sudden fury  he sprang up  ran  and
went up the ladder like a cat  his head came out in the middle of the floor of a
large round chamber  a red lamp hung from its roof  the westward window-slit was
high and dark  something was lying on the floor by the wall under the window 
but over it a black orc-shape was straddled  it raised a whip a second time  but
the blow never fell 
with a cry sam leapt across the floor  sting in hand  the orc wheeled round 
but before it could make a move sam slashed its whip-hand from its arm  howling
with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down at him  sam’s next
blow went wide  and thrown off his balance he fell backwards  clutching at the
orc as it stumbled over him  before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a
thud  the orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen
through the open trap-door  sam gave no more thought to it  he ran to the figure
huddled on the floor  it was frodo 


he was naked  lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags  his arm was flung
up  shielding his head  and across his side there ran an ugly whip-weal 
`frodo  mr  frodo  my dear ’ cried sam  tears almost blinding him  `it’s
sam  i’ve come ’ he half lifted his master and hugged him to his breast 
frodo opened his eyes 
`am i still dreaming ’ he muttered  `but the other dreams were horrible ’
`you’re not dreaming at all  master ’ said sam  `it’s real  it’s me 
i’ve come ’
`i can hardly believe it ’ said frodo  clutching him  `there was an orc
with a whip  and then it turns into sam  then i wasn’t dreaming after all when
i heard that singing down below  and i tried to answer  was it you ’
‘it was indeed  mr  frodo  i’d given up hope  almost  i couldn’t find
you 
well  you have now  sam  dear sam  said frodo  and he la back in sam’s
gentle arms  closing his eyes  like a child at rest when night-fears are driven
away by some loved voice or hand 
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness  but it was not
allowed  it was not enough for him to find his master  he had still to try and
save him  he kissed frodo’s forehead  `come  wake up mr  frodo ’ he said 
trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains at bag end
on a summer’s morning 
frodo sighed and sat up  `where are we  how did i get here ’ he asked 
‘there’s no time for tales till we get somewhere else  mr  frodo ’ said
sam  `but you’re in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by the
tunnel before the orcs got you  how long ago that was i don’t know  more than
a day  i guess ’
`only that ’ said frodo  `it seems weeks  you must tell me all about it  if
we get a chance  something hit me  didn’t it  and i fell into darkness and
foul dreams  and woke and found that waking was worse  orcs were all round me  i
think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat  my
head grew clear  but i was aching and weary  they stripped me of everything  and
then two great brutes came and questioned me  questioned me until i thought i
should go mad  standing over me  gloating  fingering their knives  i’ll never
forget their claws and eyes ’
`you won’t  if you talk about them  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘and if we
don’t want to see them again  the sooner we get going the better  can you
walk ’
`yes  i can walk ’ said frodo  getting up slowly  ‘i am not hurt sam 
only i feel very tired  and i’ve a pain here ’ he put his hand to the back
of his neck above his left shoulder  he stood up  and it looked to sam as if he
was clothed in flame  his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp above 
twice he paced across the floor 
`that’s better ’ he said  his spirits rising a little  `i didn’t dare
to move when i was left alone  or one of the guards came  until the yelling and
fighting began  the two big brutes  they quarrelled  i think  over me and my
things  i lay here terrified  and then all went deadly quiet  and that was
worse ’
`yes  they quarrelled  seemingly ’ said sam  ‘there must have been a
couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place  a bit of a tall order
for sam gamgee  as you might say  but they’ve done all the killing of
themselves  that’s lucky  but it’s too long to make a song about  till
we’re out of here  now what’s to be done  you can’t go walking in the
black land in naught but your skin  mr  frodo ’
`they’ve taken everything  sam ’ said frodo  `everything i had  do you
understand  everything ’ he cowered on the floor again with bowed head 
as his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster  and despair
overwhelmed him  ‘the quest has failed sam  even if we get out of here  we
can’t escape  only elves can escape  away  away out of middle-earth  far away
over the sea  if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out ’
`no  not everything  mr  frodo  and it hasn’t failed  not yet  i
took it  mr  frodo  begging your pardon  and i’ve kept it safe  it’s round
my neck now  and a terrible burden it is  too ’ sam fumbled for the ring and
its chain  `but i suppose you must take it back ’ now it had come to it  sam
felt reluctant to give up the ring and burden his master with it again 
`you’ve got it ’ gasped frodo  `you’ve got it here  sam  you’re a
marvel ’ then quickly and strangely his tone changed  `give it to me ’ he
cried  standing up  holding out a trembling hand  `give it me at once  you
can’t have it ’
‘all right  mr  frodo ’ said sam  rather startled  ‘here it is ’
slowly he drew the ring out and passed the chain over his head  `but you’re in
the land of mordor now  sir  and when you get out  you’ll see the fiery
mountain and all  you’ll find the ring very dangerous now  and very hard to
bear  if it’s too hard a job  i could share it with you  maybe ’
`no  no ’ cried frodo  snatching the ring and chain from sam’s hands  `no
you won’t  you thief ’ he panted  staring at sam with eyes wide with fear
and enmity  then suddenly  clasping the ring in one clenched fist  he stood
aghast  a mist seemed to clear from his eyes  and he passed a hand over his
aching brow  the hideous vision had seemed so real to him  half bemused as he
was still with wound and fear  sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
again  leering and pawing at his treasure  a foul little creature with greedy
eyes and slobbering mouth  but now the vision had passed  there was sam kneeling
before him  his face wrung with pain  as if he had been stabbed in the heart 
tears welled from his eyes 
‘o sam ’ cried frodo  `what have i said  what have i done  forgive me 
after all you have done  it is the horrible power of the ring  i wish it had
never  never  been found  but don’t mind me  sam  i must carry the burden to
the end  it can’t be altered  you can’t come between me and this doom ’
‘that’s all right  mr  frodo ’ said sam  rubbing his sleeve across his
eyes  `i understand  but i can still help  can’t i  i’ve got to get you out
of here  at once  see  but first you want some clothes and gear and then some
food  the clothes will be the easiest part  as we’re in mordor  we’d  best
dress up mordor-fashion  and anyway there isn’t no choice  it’ll have to be
orc-stuff for you  mr  frodo  i’m afraid  and for me too  if we go together 
we’d best match  now put this round you ’
sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about frodo’s shoulders  then
unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor  he drew sting from its sheath 
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade  `i was forgetting this  mr 
frodo ’ he said  `no  they didn’t get everything  you lent me sting  if you
remember  and the lady’s glass  i’ve got them both still  but lend them to
me a little longer  mr  frodo  i must go and see what i can find  you stay here 
walk about a bit and ease your legs  i shan’t be long  i shan’t have to go
far ’
`take care  sam ’ said frodo  `and be quick  there may be orcs still alive 
lurking in wait ’
‘i’ve got to chance it ’ said sam  he stepped to the trap-door and
slipped down the ladder  in a minute his head reappeared  he threw a long knife
on the floor 
`there’s something that might be useful ’ he said  ‘he’s dead  the
one that whipped you  broke his neck  it seems  in his hurry  now you draw up
the ladder  if you can  mr  frodo  and don’t you let it down till you hear me
call the password  elbereth i’ll call  what the elves say  no orc would
say that ’


frodo sat for a while and shivered  dreadful fears chasing one another through
his mind  then he got up  drew the grey elven-cloak about him  and to keep his
mind occupied  began to walk to and fro  prying and peering into every corner of
his prison 
it was not very long  though fear made it seem an hour at least  before he
heard sam’s voice calling softly from below  elbereth  elbereth  frodo
let down the light ladder  up came sam  puffing  heaving a great bundle on his
head  he let it fall with a thud 
`quick now  mr  frodo ’ he said  `i’ve had a bit of a search to find
anything small enough for the likes of us  we’ll have to make do  but we must
hurry  i’ve met nothing alive  and i’ve seen nothing but i’m not easy  i
think this place is being watched  i can’t explain it  but well  it feels to
me as if one of those foul flying riders was about  up in the blackness where he
can’t be seen ’
he opened the bundle  frodo looked in disgust at the contents  but there was
nothing for it  he had to put the things on  or go naked  there were long hairy
breeches of some unclean beast-fell  and a tunic of dirty leather  he drew them
on  over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail  short for a full-sized orc 
too long for frodo and heavy  about it he clasped a belt  at which there hung a
short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword  sam had brought several
orc-helmets  one of them fitted frodo well enough  a black cap with iron rim 
and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil eye was painted in red
above the beaklike nose-guard 
`the morgul-stuff  gorbag’s gear  was a better fit and better made ’ said
sam  `but it wouldn’t do  i guess  to go carrying his tokens into mordor  not
after this business here  well  there you are  mr  frodo  a perfect little orc 
if i may make so bold-at least you would be  if we could cover your face with a
mask  give you longer arms  and make you bow-legged  this will hide some of the
tell-tales ’ he put a large black cloak round frodo’s shoulders  `now
you’re ready  you can pick up a shield as we go ’
‘what about you  sam ’ said frodo  `aren’t we going to match ’
`well  mr  frodo  i’ve been thinking ’ said sam  ‘i’d best not leave
any of my stuff behind  and we can’t destroy it  and i can’t wear orc-mail
over all my clothes  can i  i’ll just have to cover up ’
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak  it went into a
surprisingly small roll  this he put into his pack that lay on the floor 
standing up  he slung it behind his back  put an orc-helm on his head  and cast
another black cloak about his shoulders  `there ’ he said  `now we match  near
enough  and now we must be off ’
‘i can’t go all the way at a run  sam ’ said frodo with a wry smile 
‘i hope you’ve made inquiries about inns along the road  or have you
forgotten about food and drink ’
`save me  but so i had ’ said sam  he whistled in dismay  ‘bless me  mr 
frodo  but you’ve gone and made me that hungry and thirsty  i don’t know
when drop or morsel last passed my lips  i’d forgotten it  trying to find you 
but let me think  last time i looked i’d got about enough of that waybread 
and of what captain faramir gave us  to keep me on my legs for a couple of weeks
at a pinch  but if there’s a drop left in my bottle  there’s no more 
that’s not going to be enough for two  nohow  don’t ores eat  and don’t
they drink  or do they just live on foul air and poison ’
`no  they eat and drink  sam  the shadow that bred them can only mock  it
cannot make  not real new things of its own  i don’t think it gave life to the
ores  it only ruined them and twisted them  and if they are to live at all  they
have to live like other living creatures  foul waters and foul meats they’ll
take  if they can get no better  but not poison  they’ve fed me  and so i’m
better off than you  there must be food and water somewhere in this place ’
`but there’s no time to look for them ’ said sam 
`well  things are a bit better than you think ’ said frodo  ‘i have had a
bit of luck while you were away  indeed they did not take everything  i’ve
found my food-bag among some rags on the floor  they’ve rummaged it  of
course  but i guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas 
worse than gollum did  it’s scattered about and some of it is trampled and
broken  but i’ve gathered it together  it’s not far short of what you’ve
got  but they’ve taken faramir’s food  and they’ve slashed up my
water-bottle ’
`well  there’s no more to be said ’ said sam  `we’ve got enough to
start on  but the water’s going to be a bad business  but come mr  frodo  off
we go  or a whole lake of it won’t do us any good ’
‘not till you’ve had a mouthful  sam ’ said frodo  `i won’t budge 
here  take this elven-cake  and drink that last drop in your bottle  the whole
thing is quite hopeless  so it’s no good worrying about tomorrow  it probably
won’t come ’


at last they started  down the ladder they climbed  and then sam took it and
laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc  the stair was
dark  but on the roof-top the glare of the mountain could still be seen  though
it was dying down now to a sullen red  they picked up two shields to complete
their disguise and then went on 
down the great stairway they plodded  the high chamber of the turret behind 
where they had met again  seemed almost homely  they were out in the open again
now  and terror ran along the walls  all might be dead in the tower of cirith
ungol  but it was steeped in fear and evil still 
at length they came to the door upon the outer court  and they halted  even
from where they stood they felt the malice of the watchers beating on them 
black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare of mordor
dimly showed  as they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of the ores
each step became more difficult  before they even reached the archway they were
brought to a stand  to move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and
limb 
frodo had no strength for such a battle  he sank to the ground  `i can’t go
on  sam ’ he murmured  `i’m going to faint  i don’t know what’s come
over me ’
`i do  mr  frodo  hold up now  it’s the gate  there’s some devilry there 
but i got through  and i’m going to get out  it can’t be more dangerous than
before  now for it ’
sam drew out the elven-glass of galadriel again  as if to do honour to his
hardihood  and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had
done such deeds  the phial blazed forth suddenly  so that all the shadowy court
was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning  but it remained steady and did
not pass 
‘gilthoniel  a elbereth ’ sam cried  for  why he did not know  his
thought sprang back suddenly to the elves in the shire  and the song that drove
away the black rider in the trees 
‘aiya elenion ancalima ’ cried frodo once again behind him 
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a
cord  and frodo and sam stumbled forward  then they ran  through the gate and
past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes  there was a crack  the
keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels  and the wall above crumbled 
and fell in ruin  only by a hair did they escape  a bell clanged  and from the
watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail  far up above in the darkness it
was answered  out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged
shape  rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek 
 
sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast 
‘run  mr  frodo ’ he cried  ‘no  not that way  there’s a sheer drop over
the wall  follow me ’
down the road from the gate they fled  in fifty paces  with a swift bend
round a jutting bastion of the cliff  it took them out of sight from the tower 
they had escaped for the moment  cowering back against the rock they drew
breath  and then they clutched at their hearts  perching now on the wall beside
the ruined gate the nazgûl sent out its deadly cries  all the cliffs
echoed 
in terror they stumbled on  soon the road bent sharply eastward again and
exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the tower  as they flitted
across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement  then
they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join
the morgul-road  they came to the way-meeting  there was still no sign of orcs 
nor of an answer to the cry of the nazgûl 
but they knew that the silence would not last long  at any moment now the hunt
would begin 
‘this won’t do  sam ’ said frodo  ‘if we were real orcs  we ought to
be dashing back to the tower  not running away  the first enemy we meet will
know us  we must get off this road somehow ’
‘but we can’t ’ said sam  ‘not without wings ’
the eastern faces of the ephel dúath were sheer  falling in cliff and
precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge  a short
way beyond the way-meeting  after another steep incline  a flying bridge
of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbled slopes
and glens of the morgai  with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge  but they had hardly reached its further end when they heard the hue and
cry begin  away behind them  now high above on the mountain-side  loomed the
tower of cirith ungol  its stones glowing dully  suddenly its harsh bell clanged
again  and then broke into a shattering peal  horns sounded  and now from beyond
the bridge-end came answering cries  down in the dark trough  cut off from the
dying glare of orodruin  frodo and sam could not see ahead  but already they
heard the tramp of iron-shod feet  and upon the road there rang the swift
clatter of hoofs 
‘quick  sam  over we go ’ cried frodo  they scrambled on to the low
parapet of the bridge  fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into
the gulf  for the slopes of the morgai had already risen almost to the level of
the road  but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall 
‘well  here goes  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘good-bye ’
he let go  frodo followed  and even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind 
but sam would have laughed  if he had dared  half fearing a breaking plunge down
on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed  in a drop of no more than a dozen feet 
with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected  a tangle of
thorny bushes  there sam lay still  softly sucking a scratched hand 
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper  ‘bless
me  mr  frodo  but i didn’t know as anything grew in mordor  but if i had
a’known  this is just what i’d have looked for  these thorns must be a foot
long by the feel of them  they’ve stuck through everything i’ve got on  wish
i’d a’put that mail-shirt on ’
‘orc-mail doesn’t keep these thorns out ’ said frodo  ‘not even a
leather jerkin is any good ’
they had a struggle to get out of the thicket  the thorns and briars were as
tough as wire and as clinging as claws  their cloaks were rent and tattered
before they broke free at last 
‘now down we go  sam ’ frodo whispered  ‘down into the valley quick 
and then turn northward  as soon as ever we can ’
day was coming again in the world outside  and far beyond the glooms of
mordor the sun was climbing over the eastern rim of middle-earth  but here all
was still dark as night  the mountain smouldered and its fires went out  the
glare faded from the cliffs  the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since
they left ithilien now seemed dead  slowly and painfully they clambered down 
groping  stumbling  scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind
shadows  down and down until they could go no further 
at length they stopped  and sat side by side  their backs against a boulder 
both were sweating  ‘if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of water 
i’d shake his hand ’ said sam 
‘don’t say such things ’ said frodo  ‘it only makes it worse ’ then
he stretched himself out  dizzy and weary  and he spoke no more for a while  at
last with a struggle he got up again  to his amazement he found that sam was
asleep  ‘wake up  sam ’ he said  ‘come on  it’s time we made another
effort ’
sam scrambled to his feet  ‘well i never ’ he said  ‘i must have
dropped off  it’s a long time  mr  frodo  since i had a proper sleep  and my
eyes just closed down on their own ’
frodo now led the way  northward as near as he could guess  among the stones
and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine  but presently he
stopped again 
‘it’s no good  sam ’ he said  ‘i can’t manage it  this mail-shirt 
i mean  not in my present state  even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when i was
tired  this is far heavier  and what’s the use of it  we shan’t win through
by fighting ’
‘but we may have some to do ’ said sam  ‘and there’s knives and stray
arrows  that gollum isn’t dead  for one thing  i don’t like to think of you
with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark ’
‘look here  sam dear lad ’ said frodo  ‘i am tired  weary  i haven’t
a hope left  but i have to go on trying to get to the mountain  as long as i can
move  the ring is enough  this extra weight is killing me  it must go  but
don’t think i’m ungrateful  i hate to think of the foul work you must have
had among the bodies to find it for me ’
‘don’t talk about it  mr  frodo  bless you  i’d carry you on my back 
if i could  let it go then ’
frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away  he
shivered a little  ‘what i really need is something warm ’ he said 
‘it’s gone cold  or else i’ve caught a chill ’
‘you can have my cloak  mr  frodo ’ said sam  he unslung his pack and
took out the elven-cloak  ‘how’s this  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘you wrap
that orc-rag close round you  and put the belt outside it  then this can go over
all  it don’t look quite orc-fashion  but it’ll keep you warmer  and i
daresay it’ll keep you from harm better than any other gear  it was made by
the lady ’
frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch  ‘that’s better ’ he said 
‘i feel much lighter  i can go on now  but this blind dark seems to be getting
into my heart  as i lay in prison  sam  i tried to remember the brandywine  and
woody end  and the water running through the mill at hobbiton  but i can’t see
them now ’
‘there now  mr  frodo  it’s you that’s talking of water this time ’
said sam  ‘if only the lady could see us or hear us  i’d say to her  “your
ladyship  all we want is light and water  just clean water and plain daylight 
better than any jewels  begging your pardon ” but
it’s a long way to lórien ’ sam sighed and waved his hand towards the
heights of the ephel dúath  now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness
against the black sky 


they started off again  they had not gone far when frodo paused  ‘there’s a
black rider over us ’ he said  ‘i can feel it  we had better keep still for
a while ’
crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did not
speak for some time  then frodo breathed a sigh of relief  ‘it’s passed ’
he said  they stood up  and then they both stared in wonder  away to their left 
southward  against a sky that was turning grey  the peaks and high ridges of the
great range began to appear dark and black  visible shapes  light was growing
behind them  slowly it crept towards the north  there was battle far above in
the high spaces of the air  the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven
back  their edges tattering as a wind out of the living world came up and swept
the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home  under the lifting
skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into mordor like pale morning
through the grimed window of a prison 
‘look at it  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘look at it  the wind’s changed 
something’s happening  he’s not having it all his own way  his darkness is
breaking up out in the world there  i wish i could see what is going on ’
it was the morning of the fifteenth of march  and over the vale of anduin the
sun was rising above the eastern shadow  and the
south-west wind was blowing  théoden lay dying on the pelennor fields 
as frodo and sam stood and gazed  the rim of light spread all along the line
of the ephel dúath  and then they saw a shape  moving at a great speed
out of the west  at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above
the mountain-tops  but growing  until it plunged like a bolt into the dark
canopy and passed high above them  as it went it sent out a long shrill cry  the
voice of a nazgûl  but this cry no longer held any terror for them 
it was a cry of woe and dismay  ill tidings for the dark tower  the lord of the
ring-wraiths had met his doom 
‘what did i tell you  something’s happening ’ cried sam ’ “the
war’s going well ” said shagrat  but gorbag he wasn’t so sure  and he was
right there too  things are looking up  mr  frodo  haven’t you got some hope
now ’
‘well no  not much  sam ’ frodo sighed  ‘that’s away beyond the
mountains  we’re going east not west  and i’m so tired  and the ring is so
heavy  sam  and i begin to see it in my mind all the time  like a great wheel of
fire ’
sam’s quick spirits sank again at once  he looked at his master anxiously 
and he took his hand  ‘come  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘i’ve got one thing i
wanted  a bit of light  enough to help us  and yet i guess it’s dangerous too 
try a bit further  and then we’ll lie close and have a rest  but take a morsel
to eat now  a bit of the elves’ food  it may hearten you ’
sharing a wafer of lembas  and munching it as best they could with
their parched mouths  frodo and sam plodded on  the light  though no more than a
grey dusk  was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley
between the mountains  it sloped up gently northward  and at its bottom went the
bed of a now dry and withered stream  beyond its stony course they saw a beaten
path that wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs  had they known 
they could have reached it quicker  for it was a track that left the main
morgul-road at the western bridge-end and went down by a long stair cut in the
rock to the valley’s bottom  it was used by patrols or by messengers going
swiftly to lesser posts and strongholds north-away  between cirith ungol and the
narrows of isenmouthe  the iron jaws of carach angren 
it was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path  but they needed speed 
and frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai  and he judged that northward was 
maybe  the way that their hunters would least expect them to take  the road east
to the plain  or the pass back westward  those they would first search most
thoroughly  only when he was well north of the tower did he mean to turn and
seek for some way to take him east  east on the last desperate stage of his
journey  so now they crossed the stony bed and took to the orc-path  and for
some time they marched along it  the cliffs at their left were overhung  and
they could not be seen from above  but the path made many bends  and at each
bend they gripped their sword-hilts and went forward cautiously 
the light grew no stronger  for orodruin was still belching forth a great
fume that  beaten upwards by the opposing airs  mounted higher and higher  until
it reached a region above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof  whose
central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view  they had trudged for
more than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to a halt 
unbelievable  but unmistakable  water trickling  out of a gully on the left  so
sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some
huge axe  water came dripping down  the last remains  maybe  of some sweet rain
gathered from sunlit seas  but ill-fated to fall at last upon the walls of the
black land and wander fruitless down into the dust  here it came out of the rock
in a little falling streamlet  and flowed across the path  and turning south ran
away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones 
sam sprang towards it  ‘if ever i see the lady again  i will tell her ’
he cried  ‘light and now water ’ then he stopped  ‘let me drink first mr 
frodo ’ he said 
‘all right  but there’s room enough for two ’
‘i didn’t mean that ’ said sam  ‘i mean  if it’s poisonous  or
something that will show its badness quick  well  better me than you  master  if
you understand me ’
‘i do  but i think we’ll trust our luck together  sam  or our blessing 
still  be careful now  if it’s very cold ’
the water was cool but not icy  and it had an unpleasant taste  at once
bitter and oily  or so they would have said at home  here it seemed beyond all
praise  and beyond fear or prudence  they drank their fill  and sam replenished
his water-bottle  after that frodo felt easier  and they went on for several
miles  until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall along
its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another orc-hold 
‘this is where we turn aside  sam ’ said frodo  ‘and we must turn
east ’ he sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley  ‘i
have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there  and then i
must rest a little ’
the river-bed was now some way below the path  they scrambled down to it  and
began to cross it  to their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by threads of
water trickling down from some source higher up the valley  upon its outer
marges under the westward mountains mordor was a dying land  but it was not yet
dead  and here things still grew  harsh  twisted  bitter  struggling for life 
in the glens of the morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees
lurked and clung  coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the stones  and
withered mosses crawled on them  and everywhere great writhing  tangled brambles
sprawled  some had long stabbing thorns  some hooked barbs that rent like
knives  the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them  grating and
rattling in the sad airs  but their maggot-ridden buds were only just opening 
flies  dun or grey  or black  marked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch 
buzzed and stung  and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced
and reeled 
‘orc-gear’s no good ’ said sam  waving his arms  ‘i wish i’d got an
orc’s hide ’
at last frodo could go no further  they had climbed up a narrow shelving
ravine  but they still had a long way to go before they could even come in sight
of the last craggy ridge  ‘i must rest now  sam  and sleep if i can ’ said
frodo  he looked about  but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl
into in this dismal country  at length  tired out  they slunk under a curtain of
brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock-face 
there they sat and made such a meal as they could  keeping back the precious lembas
for the evil days ahead  they ate the half of what remained in sam’s bag of
faramir’s provision  some dried fruit  and a small slip of cured meat  and
they sipped some water  they had drunk again from the pools in the valley  but
they were very  thirsty again  there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that
dried the mouth  when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed 
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross 
‘now you go to sleep first  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘it’s getting dark
again  i reckon this day is nearly over ’
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken  sam
struggled with his own weariness  and he took frodo’s hand  and there he sat
silent till deep night fell  then at last  to keep himself awake  he crawled
from the hiding-place and looked out  the land
seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises  but there was no sound of
voice or of foot  far above the ephel dúath in the west the night-sky was
still dim and pale  there  peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor
high up in the mountains  sam saw a white star twinkle for a while  the beauty
of it smote his heart  as he looked up out of the forsaken land  and hope
returned to him  for like a shaft  clear and cold  the thought pierced him that
in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing  there was light and
high beauty for ever beyond its reach  his song in the tower had been defiance
rather than hope  for then he was thinking of himself  now  for a moment  his
own fate  and even his masters  ceased to trouble him  he crawled back into the
brambles and laid himself by frodo’s side  and putting away all fear he cast
himself into a deep untroubled sleep 
they woke together  hand in hand  sam was almost fresh  ready for another
day  but frodo sighed  his sleep had been uneasy  full of dreams of fire  and
waking brought him no comfort  still his sleep had not been without all healing
virtue  he was stronger  more able to bear his burden one stage further  they
did not know the time  nor how long they had slept  but after a morsel of food
and a sip of water they went on up the ravine  until it ended in a sharp slope
of screes and sliding stones  there the last living things gave up their
struggle  the tops of the morgai were grassless  bare  jagged  barren as a
slate 
after much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb  and
with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were up  they came to a cleft
between two dark crags  and passing through found themselves on the very edge of
the last fence of mordor  below them  at the bottom of a fall of some fifteen
hundred feet  lay the inner plain stretching away into a formless gloom beyond
their sight  the wind of the world blew now from the west  and the great clouds
were lifted high  floating away eastward  but still only a grey light came to
the dreary fields of gorgoroth  there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in
hollows  and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth 
still far away  forty miles at least  they saw mount doom  its feet founded
in ashen ruin  its huge cone rising to a great height  where its reeking head
was swathed in cloud  its fires were now dimmed  and it stood in smouldering
slumber  as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast  behind it there hung
a vast shadow  ominous as a thunder-cloud  the
veils of barad-dûr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the ashen
mountains thrust down from the north  the dark power was deep in thought  and
the eye turned inward  pondering tidings of doubt and danger  a bright sword 
and a stern and kingly face it saw  and for a while it gave little thought to
other things  and all its great stronghold  gate on gate  and tower on tower 
was wrapped in a brooding gloom 
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land 
between them and the smoking mountain  and about it north and south  all seemed
ruinous and dead  a desert burned and choked  they wondered how the lord of this
realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies  yet armies he had  as far as
their eyes could reach  along the skirts of the morgai and away southward  there
were camps  some of tents  some ordered like small towns  one of the largest of
these was right below them  barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like
some huge nest of insects  with straight dreary streets of huts and long low
drab buildings  about it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro  a wide
road ran from it south-east to join the morgul-way  and along it many lines of
small black shapes were hurrying 
‘i don’t like the look of things at all ’ said sam  ‘pretty hopeless 
i call it - saving that where there’s such a lot of folk there must be wells
or water  not to mention food  and these are men not orcs  or my eyes are all
wrong ’
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm  beyond the fumes of the
mountain by the dark sad waters of lake núrnen  nor of the great roads
that ran away east and south to tributary lands  from which the soldiers of the
tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves 
here in the northward regions were the mines and forges  and the musterings of
long-planned war  and here the dark power  moving its armies like pieces on the
board  was gathering them together  its first moves  the first feelers of its
strength  had been checked upon its western line  southward and northward  for
the moment it withdrew them  and brought up new forces  massing them about
cirith gorgor for an avenging stroke  and if it had also been its purpose to
defend the mountain against all approach  it could scarcely have done more 
‘well ’ sam went on  ‘whatever they have to eat and drink  we can’t
get it  there’s no way down that i can see  and we couldn’t cross all that
open country crawling with enemies  even if we did get down ’
‘still we shall have to try ’ said frodo  ‘it’s no worse than i
expected  i never hoped to get across  i can’t see any hope of it now  but
i’ve still got to do the best i can  at present that is to avoid being
captured as long as possible  so we must still go northwards  i think  and see
what it is like where the open plain is narrower ’
‘i guess what it’ll be like ’ said sam  ‘where it’s narrower the
orcs and men will just be packed closer  you’ll see  mr  frodo ’
‘i dare say i shall  if we ever get so far ’ said frodo and turned away 
they soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the crest of
the morgai  or anywhere along its higher levels  pathless as they were and
scored with deep ghylls  in the end they were forced to go back down the ravine
that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley  it was rough going 
for they dared not cross over to the path on the westward side  after a mile or
more they saw  huddled in a hollow at the cliff’s foot  the orc-hold that they
had guessed was near at hand  a wall and a cluster of stone huts set about the
dark mouth of a cave  there was no movement to be seen  but the hobbits crept by
cautiously  keeping as much as they could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly
at this point along both sides of the old water-course 
they went two or three miles further  and the orc-hold was hidden from sight
behind them  but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh
and loud they heard orc-voices  quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown
and stunted bush  the voices drew nearer  presently two orcs came into view  one
was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn  it was of a small
breed  black-skinned  with wide and snuffling nostrils  evidently a tracker of
some kind  the other was a big fighting-orc  like those of shagrat’s company 
bearing the token of the eye  he also had a bow at his back and carried a short
broad-headed spear  as usual they were quarrelling  and being of different
breeds they used the common speech after their fashion 
hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped 
‘nar ’ it snarled  ‘i’m going home ’ it pointed across the valley to
the orc-hold  ‘no good wearing my nose out on stones any more  there’s not a
trace left  i say  i’ve lost the scent through giving way to you  it went up
into the hills  not along the valley  i tell you ’
‘not much use are you  you little snufflers ’ said the big orc  ‘i
reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses ’
‘then what have you seen with them ’ snarled the other  ‘garn  you
don’t even know what you’re looking for ’
‘whose blame’s that ’ said the soldier  ‘not mine  that comes from
higher up  first they say it’s a great elf in bright armour  then it’s a
sort of small dwarf-man  then it must be a pack of rebel uruk-hai  or maybe
it’s all the lot together ’
‘ar ’ said the tracker  ‘they’ve lost their heads  that’s what it
is  and some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too  i guess  if what i
hear is true  tower raided and all  and hundreds of your lads done in  and
prisoner got away  if that’s the way you fighters go on  small wonder
there’s bad news from the battles ’
‘who says there’s bad news ’ shouted the soldier 
‘ar  who says there isn’t ’
‘that’s cursed rebel-talk  and i’ll stick you  if you don’t shut it
down  see ’
‘all right  all right ’ said the tracker  ‘i’ll say no more and go on
thinking  but what’s the black sneak got to do with it all  that gobbler with
the flapping hands ’
‘i don’t know  nothing  maybe  but he’s up to no good  nosing around 
i’ll wager  curse him  no sooner had he slipped us and run off than word came
he’s wanted alive  wanted quick ’
‘well  i hope they get him and put him through it ’ growled the tracker 
‘he messed up the scent back there  pinching that cast-off mail-shirt that he
found  and paddling all round the place before i could get there ’
‘it saved his life anyhow ’ said the soldier  ‘why  before i knew he
was wanted i shot him  as neat as neat  at fifty paces right in the back  but he
ran on ’
‘garn  you missed him ’ said the tracker  ‘first you shoot wild  then
you run too slow  and then you send for the poor trackers  i’ve had enough of
you ’ he loped off 
‘you come back ’ shouted the soldier  ‘or i’ll report you ’
‘who to  not to your precious shagrat  he won’t be captain any more ’
‘i’ll give your name and number to the nazgûl ’ said the soldier
lowering his voice to a hiss  ‘one of them’s in charge at the
tower now ’
the other halted  and his voice was full of fear and rage  ‘you cursed
peaching sneakthief ’ he yelled  ‘you can’t do your job  and you can’t
even stick by your own folk  go to your filthy shriekers  and may they freeze
the flesh off you  if the enemy doesn’t get them first  they’ve done in
number one  i’ve heard  and i hope it’s true ’
the big orc  spear in hand  leapt after him  but the tracker  springing
behind a stone  put an arrow in his eye as he ran up  and he fell with a crash 
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared 
for a while the hobbits sat in silence  at length sam stirred  ‘well i call
that neat as neat ’ he said  ‘if this nice friendliness would spread about
in mordor  half our trouble would be over ’
‘quietly  sam ’ frodo whispered  ‘there may be others about  we have
evidently had a very narrow escape  and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than
we guessed  but that is the spirit of mordor  sam  and it has spread to every
corner of it  orcs have always behaved like that  or so all tales say  when they
are on their own  but you can’t get much hope out of it  they hate us far
more  altogether and all the time  if those two had seen us  they would have
dropped all their quarrel until we were dead ’
there was another long silence  sam broke it again  but with a whisper this
time  ‘did you hear what they said about that gobbler  mr  frodo  i
told you gollum wasn’t dead yet  didn’t i ’
‘yes  i remember  and i wondered how you knew ’ said frodo  ‘well come
now  i think we had better not move out from here again  until it has gone quite
dark  so you shall tell me how you know  and all about what happened  if you can
do it quietly ’
‘i’ll try ’ said sam  ‘but when i think of that stinker i get so hot
l could shout ’
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush  while the drear
light of mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night  and sam spoke into
frodo’s ear all that he could find words for of gollum’s treacherous attack 
the horror of shelob  and his own adventures with the orcs  when he had
finished  frodo said nothing but took sam’s hand and pressed it  at length he
stirred 
‘well  i suppose we must be going on again ’ he said  ‘i wonder how
long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the slinking
will be over  and in vain ’ he stood up  ‘it’s dark  and we cannot use the
lady’s glass  keep it safe for me  sam  i have nowhere to keep it now  except
in my hand  and i shall need both hands in the blind night  but sting i give to
you  i have got an orc-blade  but i do not think it will be my part to strike
any blow again ’
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless land  but
slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward
along the eastern edge of the stony valley  when a grey light crept back over
the western heights  long after day had opened in the lands beyond  they went
into hiding again and slept a little  turn by turn  in his times of waking sam
was busy with thoughts of food  at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of
eating and making ready for yet another effort  he asked the question that was
troubling him most 
‘begging your pardon  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘but have you any notion how
far there is still to go ’
‘no  not any clear notion  sam ’ frodo answered  ‘in rivendell before i
set out i was shown a map of mordor that was made before the enemy came back
here  but i only remember it vaguely  i remember clearest that there was a place
in the north where the western range and the northern range send out spurs that
nearly meet  that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the
tower  it might be a good point at which to cross  but of course  if we get
there  we shall be further than we were from the mountain  sixty miles from it 
i should think  i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the
bridge now  even if all goes well  i could hardly reach the mountain in a week 
i am afraid  sam  that the burden will get very heavy  and i shall go still
slower as we get nearer ’
sam sighed  ‘that’s just as i feared ’ he said  ‘well  to say nothing
of water  we’ve got to eat less  mr  frodo  or else move a bit quicker  at any
rate while we’re still in this valley  one more bite and all the food’s
ended  save the elves’ waybread ’
‘i’ll try and be a bit quicker  sam ’ said frodo  drawing a deep
breath  ‘come on then  let’s start another march ’
it was not yet quite dark again  they plodded along  on into the night  the
hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts  at the first
hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves
again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone 
slowly the light grew  until it was clearer than it yet had been  a strong
wind from the west was now driving the fumes of mordor from the upper airs 
before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some miles
about them  the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards  and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf
in the steep faces of the ephel dúath  but
to the east it fell as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth  ahead the
water-course came to an end in broken steps of rock  for out from the main range
there sprang a high barren spur  thrusting eastward like a wall  to meet it
there stretched out from the grey and misty northern range of ered lithui a long
jutting arm  and between the ends there was a narrow gap  carach angren  the
isenmouthe  beyond which lay the deep dale of udûn  in that dale behind
the morannon were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of
mordor had made for the defence of the black gate of their land  and there now
their lord was gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the
captains of the west  upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built  and
watch-fires burned  and all across the gap an earth-wall had been raised  and a
deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge 
a few miles north  high up in the angle where the western spur branched away
from the main range  stood the old castle of
durthang  now one of the many orc-holds that clustered about the dale of udûn 
a road  already visible in the growing light  came winding down from it  until
only a mile or two from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran
along a shelf cut in the side of the spur  and so went down into the plain  and
on to the isenmouthe 
to the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey north had
been useless  the plain to their right was dim and smoky  and they could see
there neither camps nor troops moving  but all that region was under the
vigilance of the forts of carach angren 
‘we have come to a dead end  sam ’ said frodo  ‘if we go on  we shall
only come up to that orc-tower  but the only road to take is that road that
comes down from it - unless we go back  we can’t climb up westward  or climb
down eastward ’
‘then we must take the road  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘we must take it and
chance our luck  if there is any luck in mordor  we might as well give ourselves
up as wander about any more  or try to go back  our food won’t last  we’ve
got to make a dash for it ’
‘all right  sam ’ said frodo  ‘lead me  as long as you’ve got any
hope left  mine is gone  but i can’t dash  sam  i’ll just plod along after
you ’
‘before you start any more plodding  you need sleep and food  mr  frodo 
come and take what you can get of them ’
he gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread  and he made a
pillow of his cloak for his master’s head  frodo was too weary to debate the
matter  and sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water 
and eaten sam’s share of the food as well as his own  when frodo was asleep
sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face  it was
lined and thin  and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid  ‘well  here
goes  master ’ sam muttered to himself  ‘i’ll have to leave you for a bit
and trust to luck  water we must have  or we’ll get no further ’
sam crept out  and flitting from stone to stone with more than hobbit-care 
he went down to the water-course  and then followed it for some way as it
climbed north  until he came to the rock-steps where long ago  no doubt  its
spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall  all now seemed dry and
silent  but refusing to despair sam stooped and listened  and to his delight he
caught the sound of trickling  clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the hill-side and filled a little bare pool 
from which again it spilled  and vanished then under the barren stones 
sam tasted the water  and it seemed good enough  then he drank deeply 
refilled the bottle  and turned to go back  at that moment he caught a glimpse
of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near frodo’s
hiding-place  biting back a cry  he leapt down from the spring and ran  jumping
from stone to stone  it was a wary creature  difficult to see  but sam had
little doubt about it  he longed to get his hands on its neck  but it heard him
coming and slipped quickly away  sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of
it  peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice  before it ducked and
disappeared 
‘well  luck did not let me down ’ muttered sam  ‘but that was a near
thing  isn’t it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that stinking
villain coming nosing round  i wish he had been shot ’ he sat down by frodo
and did not rouse him  but he did not dare to go to sleep himself  at last when
he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could not go
on much longer  he wakened frodo gently 
‘that gollum’s about again  i’m afraid  mr  frodo ’ he said 
‘leastways  if it wasn’t him  then there’s two of him  i went away to find
some water and spied him nosing round just as i turned back  i reckon it isn’t
safe for us both to sleep together  and begging your pardon  but i can’t hold
up my lids much longer ’
‘bless you  sam ’ said frodo  ‘lie down and take your proper turn  but
i’d rather have gollum than orcs  at any rate he won’t give us away to them
- not unless he’s caught himself ’
‘but he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own ’ growled sam 
‘keep your eyes open  mr  frodo  there’s a bottle full of water  drink up 
we can fill it again when we go on ’ with that sam plunged into sleep 
light was fading when he woke  frodo sat propped against the rock behind  but
he had fallen asleep  the water-bottle was empty  there was no sign of gollum 
mordor-dark had returned  and the watch-fires on the heights burned fierce
and red  when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage of all their
journey  they went first to the little spring  and then climbing warily up they
came to the road at the point where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty
miles away  it was not a broad road  and it had no wall or parapet along the
edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper 
the hobbits could hear no movements  and after listening for a while they set
off eastward at a steady pace 
after doing some twelve miles  they halted  a short way back the road had
bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now
screened from sight  this proved disastrous  they rested for some minutes and
then went on  but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the stillness
of the night they heard the sound that all along they had secretly dreaded  the
noise of marching feet  it was still some way behind them  but looking back they
could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away 
and they were moving fast  too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the road
ahead 
‘i feared it  sam ’ said frodo  ‘we’ve trusted to luck  and it has
failed us  we’re trapped ’ he looked wildly up at the frowning wall  where
the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their
heads  he ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of
gloom  ‘we’re trapped at last ’ he said he sank to the ground beneath the
wall of rock and bowed his head 
‘seems so ’ said sam  ‘well  we can but wait and see ’ and with that
he sat down beside frodo under the shadow of the cliff 
they did not have to wait long  the orcs were going at a great pace  those in
the foremost files bore torches  on they came  red flames in the dark  swiftly
growing  now sam too bowed his head  hoping that it would hide his face when the
torches reached them  and he set their shields before their knees to hide their
feet 
‘if only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers alone
and pass on ’ he thought 
and so it seemed that they would  the leading orcs came loping along 
panting  holding their heads down  they were a gang of the smaller breeds being
driven unwilling to their dark lord’s wars  all they cared for was to get the
march over and escape the whip  beside them  running up and down the line  went
two of the large fierce uruks  cracking lashes and shouting  file after
file passed  and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead  sam held
his breath  now more than half the line had gone by  then suddenly one of the
slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side  he flicked a whip at them
and yelled  ‘hi  you  get up ’ they did not answer  and with a shout he
halted the whole company 
‘come on  you slugs ’ he cried  ‘this is
no time for slouching ’ he took a step towards them  and even in the gloom he
recognized the devices on their shields  ‘deserting  eh ’ he snarled  ‘or
thinking of it  all your folk should have been inside udûn before
yesterday evening  you know that  up you get and fall in  or i’ll have
your numbers and report you ’
they struggled to their feet  and keeping bent  limping like footsore
soldiers  they shuffled back towards the rear of the line  ‘no  not at the
rear ’ the slave-driver shouted  ‘three files up  and stay there  or
you’ll know it  when i come down the line ’ he sent his long whip-lash
cracking over their heads  then with another crack and a yell he started the
company off again at a brisk trot 
it was hard enough for poor sam  tired as he was  but for frodo it was a
torment  and soon a nightmare  he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind from
thinking  and he struggled on  the stench of the sweating orcs about him was
stifling  and he began to gasp with thirst  on  on they went  and he bent all
his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going  and yet to what
evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think  there was no hope of
falling out unseen  now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeered at them 
‘there now ’ he laughed  flicking at their legs  ‘where there’s a
whip there’s a will  my slugs  hold up  i’d give you a nice freshener now 
only you’ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to
your camp  do you good  don’t you know we’re at war ’
they had gone some miles  and the road was at last running down a long slope
into the plain  when frodo’s strength began to give out and his will wavered 
he lurched and stumbled  desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up 
though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer  at any
moment now he knew that the end would come  his master would faint or fall  and
all would be discovered  and their bitter efforts be in vain  ‘i’ll have
that big slave-driving devil anyway ’ he thought 
then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword  there came an
unexpected relief  they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance
to udûn  some way in front of it  before the gate at the bridge-end  the
road from the west converged with others coming from the south  and from barad-dûr 
along all the roads troops were moving  for the captains of the west were
advancing and the dark lord was speeding his forces north  so it chanced that
several companies came together at the road-meeting  in the dark beyond
the light of the watch-fires on the wall  at once there was great jostling and
cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their
march  though the drivers yelled and plied their whips  scuffles broke out and
some blades were drawn  a troop of heavy-armed uruks
from barad-dûr charged into the durthang line and threw them into
confusion 
dazed as he was with pain and weariness  sam woke up  grasped quickly at his
chance  and threw himself to the ground  dragging frodo down with him  orcs fell
over them  snarling and cursing  slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled
away out of the turmoil  until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further
edge of the road  it had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog  and it was banked up some feet above the level
of the open land 
they lay still for a while  it was too dark to seek for cover  if indeed
there was any to find  but sam felt that they ought at least to get further away
from the highways and out of the range of torch-light 
‘come on  mr  frodo ’ he whispered  ‘one more crawl  and then you can
lie still ’
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on his hands  and
struggled on for maybe twenty yards  then he pitched down into a shallow pit
that opened unexpectedly before them  and there he lay like a dead thing 
 
sam put his ragged orc-cloak under his master’s head  and covered them both
with the grey robe of lórien  and as he did so his thoughts went
out to that fair land  and to the elves  and he hoped that the cloth woven by
their hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this
wilderness of fear  he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the troops
passed on through the isenmouthe  it seemed that in the confusion and the
mingling of many companies of various kinds they had not been missed  not yet at
any rate 
sam took a sip of water  but pressed frodo to drink  and when his master had
recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made
him eat it  then  too worn out even to feel much fear  they stretched themselves
out  they slept a little in uneasy fits  for their sweat grew chill on them  and
the hard stones bit them  and they shivered  out of the north from the black
gate through cirith gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold
air 
in the morning a grey light came again  for in the high regions the west wind
still blew  but down on the stones behind the fences of the black land the air
seemed almost dead  chill and yet stifling  sam looked up out of the hollow  the
land all about was dreary  flat and drab-hued  on the roads nearby nothing was
moving now  but sam feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe  no
more than a furlong away northward  south-eastward  far off like a dark standing
shadow  loomed the mountain  smokes were pouring from it and while those that
rose into the upper air trailed away eastward  great rolling clouds floated down
its sides and spread over the land  a few miles to the north-east the foothills
of the ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts  behind which the misty
northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the
lowering sky 
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to take 
it looks every step of fifty miles ’ he muttered gloomily staring at the
threatening mountain  ‘and that’ll take a week  if it takes a day  with mr 
frodo as he is ’ he shook his head  and as he worked things out  slowly a new
dark thought grew in his mind  never for long had hope died in his staunch
heart  and always until now he had taken some thought for their return  but the
bitter truth came home to him at last  at best their provision would take them
to their goal  and when the task was done  there they would come to an end 
alone  houseless  foodless in the midst of a terrible desert  there could be no
return 
‘so that was the job i felt i had to do when i started ’ thought sam 
‘to help mr  frodo to the last step and then die with him  well  if that is
the job then i must do it  but i would dearly like to see bywater again  and
rosie cotton and her brothers  and the gaffer and marigold and all  i can’t
think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr  frodo on this errand if there
hadn’t a’ been any hope of his ever coming back at all  things all went
wrong when he went down in moria  i wish he hadn’t  he would have done
something ’
but even as hope died in sam  or seemed to die  it was turned to a new
strength  sam’s plain hobbit-face grew stern  almost grim  as the will
hardened in him  and he felt through all his limbs a thrill  as if he was
turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness
nor endless barren miles could subdue 
with a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the ground
near at hand  studying the next move  as the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and featureless flats were in
fact all broken and tumbled  indeed the whole surface of the plains of gorgoroth
was pocked with great holes  as if  while it was still a waste of soft mud  it
had been smitten with a shower of bolts and huge slingstones  the largest of
these holes were rimmed with ridges of broken rock  and broad fissures ran out
from them in all directions  it was a land in which it would be possible to
creep from hiding to hiding  unseen by all but the most watchful eyes  possible
at least for one who was strong and had no need for speed  for the hungry and
worn  who had far to go before life failed  it had an evil look 
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master  he had no need to
rouse him  frodo was lying on his back with eyes open  staring at the cloudy
sky  ‘well  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘i’ve been having a look round and
thinking a bit  there’s nothing on the roads  and we’d best be getting away
while there’s a chance  can you manage it ’
‘i can manage it ’ said frodo  ‘i must ’
once more they started  crawling from hollow to hollow  flitting behind such
cover as they could find  but moving always in a slant towards the foothills of
the northern range  but as they went the most easterly of the roads followed
them  until it ran off  hugging the skirts of the mountains  away into a wall of
black shadow far ahead  neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey
stretches  for the dark lord had almost completed the movement of his forces 
and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought the secrecy of night 
fearing the winds of the world that had turned against him  tearing aside his
veils  and troubled with tidings of bold spies that had passed through his
fences 
the hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted  frodo seemed nearly
spent  sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion  crawling 
stooping  now picking a doubtful way very slowly  now hurrying at a stumbling
run 
‘i’m going back on to the road while the light lasts  mr  frodo ’ he
said  ‘trust to luck again  it nearly failed us last time  but it didn’t
quite  a steady pace for a few more miles  and then a rest ’
he was taking a far greater risk than he knew  but frodo was too much
occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate  and almost
too hopeless to care  they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along  down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself  but their luck held  and
for the rest of that day they met no living or moving thing  and when night fell
they vanished into the darkness of mordor  all the land now brooded as at the
coming of a great storm  for the captains of the west had passed the cross-roads
and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul 
so the desperate journey went on  as the ring went south and the banners of
the kings rode north  for the hobbits each day  each mile  was more bitter than
the one before  as their strength lessened and the land became more evil  they
met no enemies by day  at times by night  as they cowered or drowsed uneasily in
some hiding beside the road  they heard cries and the noise of many feet or the
swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed  but far worse than all such perils
was the ever-approaching threat that beat upon them as they went  the dreadful
menace of the power that waited  brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice
behind the dark veil about its throne  nearer and nearer it drew  looming
blacker  like the oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world 
there came at last a dreadful nightfall  and even as the captains of the west
drew near to the end of the living lands  the two wanderers came to an hour of
blank despair  four days had passed since they had escaped from the orcs  but
the time lay behind them like an ever-darkening dream  all this last day frodo
had not spoken  but had walked half-bowed  often stumbling  as if his eyes no
longer saw the way before his feet  sam guessed that among all their pains he
bore the worst  the growing weight of the ring  a burden on the body and a
torment to his mind  anxiously sam had noted how his master’s left hand would
often be raised as if to ward on a blow  or to screen his shrinking eyes from a
dreadful eye that sought to look in them  and sometimes his right hand would
creep to his breast  clutching  and then slowly  as the will recovered mastery 
it would be withdrawn 
now as the blackness of night returned frodo sat  his head between his knees 
his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly twitching  sam
watched him  till night covered them both and hid them from one another  he
could no longer find any words to say  and he turned to his own dark thoughts 
as for himself  though weary and under a shadow of fear  he still had some
strength left  the lembas had a virtue without which they would long ago
have lain down to die  it did not satisfy desire  and at times sam’s mind was
filled with the memories of food  and the longing for simple bread and meats 
and yet this waybread of the elves had a potency that increased as travellers
relied on it alone and did not mingle it with other foods  it fed the will  and
it gave strength to endure  and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of
mortal kind  but now a new decision must be made  they could not follow this
road any longer  for it went on eastward into the great shadow  but the mountain
now loomed upon their right  almost due south  and they must turn towards it 
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming  barren  ash-ridden
land 
‘water  water ’ muttered sam  he had stinted himself  and in his parched
mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen  but for all his care they now had
very little left  perhaps half his bottle  and maybe there were still days to
go  all would long ago have been spent  if they had not dared to follow the
orc-road  for at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been built for the
use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions  in one sam had found
some water left  stale  muddied by the orcs  but still sufficient for their
desperate case  yet that was now a day ago  there was no hope of any more 
at last wearied with his cares sam drowsed  leaving the morrow till it came 
he could do no more  dream and waking mingled uneasily  he saw lights like
gloating yes  and dark creeping shapes  and he heard noises as of wild beasts or
the dreadful cries of tortured things  and he would start up to find the world
all dark and only empty blackness all about him  once only  as he stood and
stared wildly round  did it seem that  though now awake  he could still see pale
lights like eyes  but soon they flickered and vanished 
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly  such daylight as followed
was dim  for here as the mountain drew near the air was ever mirky  while out
from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that sauron wove about
himself  frodo was lying on his back not moving  sam stood beside him  reluctant
to speak  and yet knowing that the word now lay with him  he must set his
master’s will to work for another effort  at length  stooping and caressing
frodo’s brow  he spoke in his ear 
‘wake up  master ’ he said  ‘time for another start ’
as if roused by a sudden bell  frodo rose quickly  and stood up and looked
away southwards  but when his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed
again 
‘i can’t manage it  sam ’ he said  ‘it is such a weight to carry 
such a weight ’
sam knew before he spoke  that it was vain  and that such words might do more
harm than good  but in his pity he could not keep silent  ‘then let me carry
it a bit for you  master ’ he said  ‘you know i would  and gladly  as long
as i have any strength ’
a wild light came into frodo’s eyes  ‘stand away  don’t touch me ’ he
cried  ‘it is mine  i say  be off ’ his hand strayed to his sword-hilt  but
then quickly his voice changed  ‘no  no  sam ’ he said sadly  ‘but you
must understand  it is my burden  and no one else can bear it  it is too late
now  sam dear  you can’t help me in that way again  i am almost in its power
now  i could not give it up  and if you tried to take it i should go mad ’
sam nodded  ‘i understand ’ he said  ‘but i’ve been thinking  mr 
frodo  there’s other things we might do without  why not lighten the load a
bit  we’re going that way now  as straight as we can make it ’ he pointed to
the mountain  ‘it’s no good taking anything we’re not sure to need ’
frodo looked again towards the mountain  ‘no ’ he said  ‘we shan’t
need much on that road  and at its end nothing ’ picking up his orc-shield he
flung it away and threw his helmet after it  then pulling off the grey cloak he
undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground  and the sheathed sword with
it  the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered 
‘there  i’ll be an orc no more ’ he cried  ‘and i’ll bear no weapon
fair or foul  let them take me  if they will ’
sam did likewise  and put aside his orc-gear  and he took out all the things
in his pack  somehow each of them had become dear to him  if only because he had
borne them so far with so much toil  hardest of all it was to part with his
cooking-gear  tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away 
‘do you remember that bit of rabbit  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘and our
place under the warm bank in captain faramir’s country  the day i saw an
oliphaunt ’
‘no  i am afraid not  sam ’ said frodo  ‘at least  i know that such
things happened  but i cannot see them  no taste of food  no feel of water  no
sound of wind  no memory of tree or grass or flower  no image of moon or star
are left to me  i am naked in the dark  sam  and there is no veil between me and
the wheel of fire  i begin to see it even with my waking eyes  and all else
fades ’
sam went to him and kissed his hand  ‘then the sooner we’re rid of it 
the sooner to rest ’ he said haltingly  finding no better words to say 
‘talking won’t mend nothing ’ he muttered to himself  as he gathered up
all the things that they had chosen to cast away  he was not willing to leave
them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see  ‘stinker picked up that
orc-shirt  seemingly  and he isn’t going to add a sword to it  his hands are
bad enough when empty  and he isn’t going to mess with my pans ’ with that
he carried all the gear away to one of the many gaping fissures that scored the
land and threw them in  the clatter of his precious pans as they fell down into
the dark was like a death-knell to his heart 
he came back to frodo  and then of his elven-rope he cut a short piece to
serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist  the
rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack  beside that he kept only the
remnants of their waybread and the water-bottle  and sting still hanging by his
belt  and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his breast the phial of
galadriel and the little box that she gave him for his own 
now at last they turned their faces to the mountain and set out  thinking no
more of concealment  bending their weariness and failing wills only to the one
task of going on  in the dimness of its dreary day few things even in that land
of vigilance could have espied them  save from close at hand  of all the slaves
of the dark lord  only the nazgûl could have warned him of the peril that
crept  small but indomitable  into the very heart of his guarded realm  but the
nazgûl and their black wings were abroad on another errand  they
were gathered far away  shadowing the march of the captains of the west  and
thither the thought of the dark tower was turned 
that day it seemed to sam that his master had found some new strength  more
than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had to
carry  in the first marches they went further and faster than he had hoped  the
land was rough and hostile  and yet they made much progress  and ever the
mountain drew nearer  but as the day wore on and all too soon the dim light
began to fail  frodo stooped again  and began to stagger  as if the renewed
effort had squandered his remaining strength 
at their last halt he sank down and said  ‘i’m thirsty  sam ’ and did
not speak again  sam gave him a mouthful of water  only one more mouthful
remained  he went without himself  and now as once more the night of mordor
closed over them  through all his thoughts there came the memory of water  and
every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen  under green willow-shades
or twinkling in the sun  danced and rippled for his torment behind the blindness
of his eyes  he felt the cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the pool at
bywater with jolly cotton and tom and nibs  and their sister rosie  ‘but that
was years ago ’ he sighed  ‘and far away  the way back  if there is one 
goes past the mountain ’
he could not sleep and he held a debate with himself  ‘well  come now 
we’ve done better than you hoped ’ he said sturdily  ‘began well anyway  i
reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped  one more day will do
it ’ and then he paused 
‘don’t be a fool  sam gamgee ’ came an answer in his own voice  ‘he
won’t go another day like that  if he moves at all  and you can’t go on much
longer giving him all the water and most of the food ’
‘i can go on a good way though  and i will ’
‘where to ’
‘to the mountain  of course ’
‘but what then  sam gamgee  what then  when you get there  what are you
going to do  he won’t be able to do anything for himself ’
to his dismay sam realized that he had not got an answer to this  he had no
clear idea at all  frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand  and sam only
knew vaguely that the ring had somehow to be put into the fire  ‘the cracks of
doom ’ he muttered  the old name rising to his mind  ‘well  if master knows
how to find them  i don’t ’
‘there you are ’ came the answer  ‘it’s all quite useless  he said so
himself  you are the fool  going on hoping and toiling  you could have lain down
and gone to sleep together days ago  if you hadn’t been so dogged  but
you’ll die just the same  or worse  you might just as well lie down now and
give it up  you’ll never get to the top anyway ’
‘i’ll get there  if i leave everything but my bones behind ’ said sam 
‘and i’ll carry mr  frodo up myself  if it breaks my back and heart  so stop
arguing ’
at that moment sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him  and he heard or
sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the earth  there was
a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away  the mountain
too slept uneasily 
the last stage of their journey to orodruin came  and it was a torment
greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear  he was in pain  and so
parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food  it remained
dark  not only because of the smokes of the mountain  there seemed to be a storm
coming up  and away to the south-east there was a shimmer of lightnings under
the black skies  worst of all  the air was full of fumes  breathing was painful
and difficult  and a dizziness came on them  so that they staggered and often
fell  and yet their wills did not yield  and they struggled on 
the mountain crept up ever nearer  until  if they lifted their heavy heads 
it filled all their sight  looming vast before them  a huge mass of ash and slag
and burned stone  out of which a sheer-sided cone was raised into the clouds 
before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again they had crawled and
stumbled to its very feet 
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground  sam sat by him  to his surprise
he felt tired but lighter  and his head seemed clear again  no more debates
disturbed his mind  he knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to
them  his will was set  and only death would break it  he felt no longer either
desire or need of sleep  but rather of watchfulness  he knew that all the
hazards and perils were now drawing together to a point  the next day would be a
day of doom  the day of final effort or disaster  the last gasp 
but when would it come  the night seemed endless and timeless  minute after
minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour  bringing no change  sam
began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day would ever reappear 
at last he groped for frodo’s hand  it was cold and trembling  his master was
shivering 
‘i didn’t ought to have left my blanket behind ’ muttered sam  and
lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body  then sleep took
him  and the dim light of the last day of their quest found them side by side 
the wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the west  and now it came
from the north and began to rise  and slowly the light of the unseen sun
filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay 
‘now for it  now for the last gasp ’ said sam as he struggled to his
feet  he bent over frodo  rousing him gently  frodo groaned  but with a great
effort of will he staggered up  and then he fell upon his knees again  he raised
his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of mount doom towering above him 
and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands 
sam looked at him and wept in his heart  but no tears came to his dry and
stinging eyes  ‘i said i’d carry him  if it broke my back ’ he muttered 
‘and i will ’
‘come  mr  frodo ’ he cried  ‘i can’t carry it for you  but i can
carry you and it as well  so up you get  come on  mr  frodo dear  sam will give
you a ride  just tell him where to go  and he’ll go ’
as frodo clung upon his back  arms loosely about his neck  legs clasped
firmly under his arms  sam staggered to his feet  and then to his amazement he
felt the burden light  he had feared that he would have barely strength to lift
his master alone  and beyond that he had expected to share in the dreadful
dragging weight of the accursed ring  but it was not so  whether because frodo
was so worn by his long pains  wound of knife  and venomous sting  and sorrow 
fear  and homeless wandering  or because some gift of final strength was given
to him  sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty than if he were carrying a
hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on the lawns or hayfields of the shire  he
took a deep breath and started off 
they had reached the mountain’s foot on its northern side  and a little to
the westward  there its long grey slopes  though broken  were not sheer  frodo
did not speak  and so sam struggled on as best he could  having no guidance but
the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave out and his will
broke  on he toiled  up and up  turning this way and that to lessen the slope 
often stumbling forward  and at the last crawling like a snail with a heavy
burden on its back  when his will could drive him no further  and his limbs gave
way  he stopped and laid his master gently down 
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath  it was easier to breathe up here
above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below  ‘thank you  sam ’ he
said in a cracked whisper  ‘how far is there to go ’
‘i don’t know ’ said sam  ‘because i don’t know where we’re
going ’
he looked back  and then he looked up  and he was amazed to see how far his
last effort had brought him  the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked
taller than it was  sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high
passes of the ephel dúath which he and frodo had scaled  the confused and
tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above the
plain  and above them was reared half as high again its tall central cone  like
a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater  but already sam was
more than half way up the base  and the plain of gorgoroth was dim below him 
wrapped in fume and shadow  as he looked up he would have given a shout  if his
parched throat had allowed him  for amid the rugged humps and shoulders above
him he saw plainly a path or road  it climbed like a rising girdle from the west
and wound snakelike about the mountain  until before it went round out of view
it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side 
sam could not see the course immediately above him  where it was lowest  for
a steep slope went up from where he stood  but he guessed that if he could only
struggle on just a little way further up  they would strike this path  a gleam
of hope returned to him  they might conquer the mountain yet  ‘why  it might
have been put there a-purpose ’ he said to himself  ‘if it wasn’t there 
i’d have to say i was beaten in the end ’
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam  he did not know it  but
he was looking at sauron’s road from barad-dûr
to the sammath naur  the chambers of fire  out from the dark tower’s huge
western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron  and then
passing into the plain it ran for a league between two smoking chasms  and so reached
a long sloping causeway that led up on to the mountain’s eastern side  thence 
turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north  it climbed at
last  high in the upper cone  but still far from the reeking summit  to a dark
entrance that gazed back east straight to the window of the eye in sauron’s
shadow-mantled fortress  often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the
mountain’s furnaces  always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the
labours of countless orcs 
sam drew a deep breath  there was a path  but how he was to get up the slope
to it he did not know  first he must ease his aching back  he lay flat beside
frodo for a while  neither spoke  slowly the light grew  suddenly a sense of
urgency which he did not understand came to sam  it was almost as if he had been
called  ‘now  now  or it will be too late ’ he braced himself and got up 
frodo also seemed to have felt the call  he struggled to his knees 
‘i’ll crawl  sam ’ he gasped 
so foot by foot  like small grey insects  they crept up the slope  they came
to the path and found that it was broad  paved with broken rubble and beaten
ash  frodo clambered on to it  and then moved as if by some compulsion he turned
slowly to face the east  far off the shadows of sauron hung  but torn by some
gust of wind out of the world  or else moved by some great disquiet within  the
mantling clouds swirled  and for a moment drew aside  and then he saw  rising
black  blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood  the cruel
pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of
barad-dûr  one moment only it stared out  but as from some great window
immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red  the flicker of a
piercing eye  and then the shadows were furled again and the terrible
vision was removed  the eye was not turned to them  it was gazing north to where
the captains of the west stood at bay  and thither all its malice was now bent 
as the power moved to strike its deadly blow  but frodo at that dreadful glimpse
fell as one stricken mortally  his hand sought the chain about his neck 
sam knelt by him  faint  almost inaudibly  he heard frodo whispering  ‘help
me  sam  help me  sam  hold my hand  i can’t stop it ’ sam took his
master’s hands and laid them together  palm to palm  and kissed them  and then
he held them gently between his own  the thought came suddenly to him  ‘he’s
spotted us  it’s all up  or it soon will be  now  sam gamgee  this is the end
of ends ’
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast  letting his
master’s legs dangle  then he bowed his head and struggled off along the
climbing road  it was not as easy a way to take as it had looked at first  by
fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils when sam stood
upon cirith ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern and western slopes  and
the road on this side was not blocked  yet in many places it had crumbled away
or was crossed by gaping rents  after climbing eastward for some time it bent
back upon itself at a sharp angle and went westward fox a space  there at the
bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered stone once long ago vomited
from the mountain’s furnaces  panting under his load sam turned the bend  and
even as he did so  out of the corner of his eye  he had a glimpse of something
falling from the crag  like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as
he passed 
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward  tearing the backs of his
hands that still clasped his master’s  then he knew what had happened  for
above him as he lay he heard a hated voice 
‘wicked masster ’ it hissed  ‘wicked masster
cheats us  cheats sméagol  gollum  he musstn’t go that
way  he musstn’t hurt preciouss  give it to sméagol 
yess  give it to us  give it to uss ’
with a violent heave sam rose up  at once he drew his sword  but he could do
nothing  gollum and frodo were locked together  gollum was tearing at his
master  trying to get at the chain and the ring  this was probably the only
thing that could have roused the dying embers of frodo’s heart and will  an
attack  an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force  he fought back with
a sudden fury that amazed sam  and gollum also  even so things might have gone
far otherwise  if gollum himself had remained unchanged  but whatever dreadful
paths  lonely and hungry and waterless  he had trodden  driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible fear  they had left grievous marks on him  he was a lean 
starved  haggard thing  all bones and tight-drawn sallow skin  a wild light
flamed in his eyes  but his malice was no longer matched by his old griping
strength  frodo flung him off and rose up quivering 
‘down  down ’ he gasped  clutching his hand to his breast  so that
beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring  ‘down you creeping
thing  and out of my path  your time is at an end  you cannot betray me or slay
me now ’
then suddenly  as before under the eaves of the emyn muil  sam saw these two
rivals with other vision  a crouching shape  scarcely more than the shadow of a
living thing  a creature now wholly ruined and defeated  yet filled with a
hideous lust and rage  and before it stood stern  untouchable now by pity  a
figure robed in white  but at its breast it held a wheel of fire  out of the
fire there spoke a commanding voice 
‘begone  and trouble me no more  if you touch me ever again  you shall be
cast yourself into the fire of doom ’
the crouching shape backed away  terror in its blinking eyes  and yet at the
same time insatiable desire 
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing  hand on breast  his breath
coming in great gasps  and gollum at his feet  resting on his knees with his
wide-splayed hands upon the ground 
‘look out ’ cried sam  ‘he’ll spring ’ he stepped forward 
brandishing his sword  ‘quick  master ’ he gasped  ‘go on  go on  no time
to lose  i’ll deal with him  go on ’
frodo looked at him as if at one now far away  ‘yes  i must go on ’ he
said  ‘farewell  sam  this is the end at last  on mount doom doom shall fall 
farewell ’ he turned and went on  walking slowly but erect up the climbing
path 
‘now ’ said sam  ‘at last i can deal with you ’ he leaped forward
with drawn blade ready for battle  but gollum did not spring  he fell flat upon
the ground and whimpered 
‘don’t kill us ’ he wept  ‘don’t hurt us with nassty cruel steel 
let us live  yes  live just a little longer  lost lost  we’re lost  and when
precious goes we’ll die  yes  die into the dust ’ he clawed up the ashes of
the path with his long fleshless fingers  ‘dusst ’ he hissed 
sam’s hand wavered  his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil  it
would be just to slay this treacherous  murderous creature  just and many times
deserved  and also it seemed the only safe thing to do  but deep in his heart
there was something that restrained him  he could not strike this thing lying in
the dust  forlorn  ruinous  utterly wretched  he himself  though only for a
little while  had borne the ring  and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollum’s shrivelled mind and body  enslaved to that ring  unable to find peace
or relief ever in life again  but sam had no words to express what he felt 
‘oh  curse you  you stinking thing ’ he said  ‘go away  be off  i
don’t trust you  not as far as i could kick you  but be off  or i shall
hurt you  yes  with nasty cruel steel ’
gollum got up on all fours  and backed away for several paces  and then he
turned  and as sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path  sam gave no
more heed to him  he suddenly remembered his master  he looked up the path and
could not see him  as fast as he could he trudged up the road  if he had looked
back  he might have seen not far below gollum turn again  and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come  swiftly but warily  creeping on
behind  a slinking shadow among the stones 
the path climbed on  soon it bent again and  with a last eastward course
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to the dark door in the
mountain’s side  the door of the sammath naur  far away now rising towards the
south the sun  piercing the smokes and haze  burned ominous  a dull bleared disc
of red  but all mordor lay about the mountain like a dead land  silent 
shadow-folded  waiting for some dreadful stroke 
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in  it was dark and hot  and a deep
rumbling shook the air  ‘frodo  master ’ he called  there was no answer  for
a moment he stood  his heart beating with wild fears  and then he plunged in  a
shadow followed him 
at first he could see nothing  in his great need he drew out once more the
phial of galadriel  but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and threw no
light into that stifling dark  he was come to the heart of the realm of sauron
and the forges of his ancient might  greatest in middle-earth  all other powers
were here subdued  fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark  and then
all at once there came a flash of red that leaped upward  and smote the high
black roof  then sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into
the mountain’s smoking cone  but only a short way ahead its floor and the
walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure  out of which the red glare
came  now leaping up  now dying down into darkness  and all the while far below
there was a rumour and a trouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring 
the light sprang up again  and there on the brink of the chasm  at the very
crack of doom  stood frodo  black against the glare  tense  erect  but still as
if he had been turned to stone 
‘master ’ cried sam 
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice  indeed with a voice clearer
and more powerful than sam had ever heard him use  and it rose above the throb
and turmoil of mount doom  ringing in the roof and walls 
‘i have come ’ he said  ‘but i do not choose now to do what i came to
do  i will not do this deed  the ring is mine ’ and suddenly  as he set it on
his finger  he vanished from sam’s sight  sam gasped  but he had no chance to
cry out  for at that moment many things happened 
something struck sam violently in the back  his legs were knocked from under
him and he was flung aside  striking his head against the stony floor  as a dark
shape sprang over him  he lay still and for a moment all went black 
and far away  as frodo put on the ring and claimed it for
his own  even in sammath naur the very heart of his realm  the power in barad-dûr
was shaken  and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter
crown  the dark lord was suddenly aware of him  and his eye piercing all shadows
looked across the plain to the door that he had made  and the magnitude
of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash  and all the devices of
his enemies were at last laid bare  then his wrath blazed in consuming flame 
but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him  for he knew his deadly
peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung 
from all his policies and webs of fear and treachery  from all his stratagems
and wars his mind shook free  and throughout his realm a tremor ran  his slaves
quailed  and his armies halted  and his captains suddenly steerless  bereft of
will  wavered and despaired  for they were forgotten  the whole mind and purpose
of the power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the
mountain  at his summons  wheeling with a rending
cry  in a last desperate race there flew  faster than the winds  the nazgûl
the ringwraiths  and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to mount
doom 
sam got up  he was dazed  and blood streaming from his head dripped in his
eyes  he groped forward  and then he saw a strange and terrible thing  gollum on
the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe  to and
fro he swayed  now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in  now dragging
back  falling to the ground  rising  and falling again  and all the while he
hissed but spoke no words 
the fires below awoke in anger  the red light blazed  and all the cavern was
filled with a great glare and heat  suddenly sam saw gollum’s long hands draw
upwards to his mouth  his white fangs gleamed  and then snapped as they bit 
frodo gave a cry  and there he was  fallen upon his knees at the chasm’s edge 
but gollum  dancing like a mad thing  held aloft the ring  a finger still thrust
within its circle  it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire 
‘precious  precious  precious ’ gollum cried  ‘my precious  o my
precious ’ and with that  even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his
prize  he stepped too far  toppled  wavered for a moment on the brink  and then
with a shriek he fell  out of the depths came his last wail precious  and
he was gone 
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise  fires leaped up and licked
the roof  the throbbing grew to a great tumult  and the mountain shook  sam ran
to frodo and picked him up and carried him  out to the door  and there upon the
dark threshold of the sammath naur  high above the plains of mordor  such wonder
and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting all else  and gazed as one
turned to stone 
a brief vision he had of swirling cloud  and in the midst of it towers and
battlements  tall as hills  founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above
immeasurable pits  great courts and dungeons  eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs 
and gaping gates of steel and adamant  and then all passed  towers fell and
mountains slid  walls crumbled and melted  crashing down  vast spires of smoke
and spouting steams went billowing up  up  until they toppled like an
overwhelming wave  and its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the
land  and then at last over the miles between there came a rumble  rising to a
deafening crash and roar  the earth shook  the plain heaved and cracked  and
orodruin reeled  fire belched from its riven summit  the skies burst into
thunder seared with lightning  down like lashing
whips fell a torrent of black rain  and into the heart of the storm  with a cry
that pierced all other sounds  tearing the clouds asunder  the nazgûl
came  shooting like flaming bolts  as caught in the fiery ruin of hill
and sky they crackled  withered  and went out 
‘well  this is the end  sam gamgee ’ said a voice by his side  and there
was frodo  pale and worn  and yet himself again  and in his eyes there was peace
now  neither strain of will  nor madness  nor any fear  his burden was taken
away  there was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire 
‘master ’ cried sam  and fell upon his knees  in all that ruin of the
world for the moment he felt only joy  great joy  the burden was gone  his
master had been saved  he was himself again  he was free  and then sam caught
sight of the maimed and bleeding hand 
‘your poor hand ’ he said  ‘and i have nothing to bind it with  or
comfort it  i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather  but he’s gone
now beyond recall  gone for ever ’
‘yes ’ said frodo  ‘but do you remember gandalf’s words  even
gollum may have something yet to do  but for him  sam  i could not have
destroyed the ring  the quest would have been in vain  even at the bitter end 
so let us forgive him  for the quest is achieved  and now all is over  i am glad
you are here with me  here at the end of all things  sam ’
 
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged  the captains of the west were
foundering in a gathering sea  the sun gleamed red 
and under the wings of the nazgûl the shadows of death fell dark upon the
earth  aragorn stood beneath his banner  silent and stern  as one lost in
thought of things long past or far away  but his eyes gleamed like stars that
shine the brighter as the night deepens  upon the hill-top stood gandalf 
and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him  the onslaught of mordor
broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills  voices roaring like a tide amid the
wreck and crash of arms 
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given  gandalf stirred  and he
turned  looking back north where the skies were pale and clear  then he lifted
up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din  the eagles are
coming  and many voices answered crying  the eagles are coming  the
eagles are coming  the hosts of mordor looked up and wondered what this sign
might mean 
there came gwaihir the windlord  and landroval his brother  greatest of all
the eagles of the north  mightiest of the descendants of old thorondor  who
built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when
middle-earth was young  behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mountains  speeding on a gathering wind  straight down upon the
nazgûl they bore  stooping suddenly out of the high airs  and the rush of
their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale 
but the nazgûl turned and fled  and vanished into mordor’s shadows 
hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark tower  and even at that
moment all the hosts of mordor trembled  doubt clutched their hearts  their
laughter failed  their hands shook and their limbs were loosed  the power that
drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering  its will was
removed from them  and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a
deadly light and were afraid 
then all the captains of the west cried aloud  for their hearts were filled
with a new hope in the midst of darkness  out from the beleaguered hills knights
of gondor  riders of rohan  dúnedain of the
north  close-serried companies  drove against their wavering foes  piercing the
press with the thrust of bitter spears  but gandalf lifted up his arms and
called once more in a clear voice 
‘stand  men of the west  stand and wait  this is the hour of doom ’
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet  then rising swiftly
up  far above the towers of the black gate  high above the mountains  a vast
soaring darkness sprang into the sky  flickering with fire  the earth groaned
and quaked  the towers of the teeth swayed  tottered  and fell down  the mighty
rampart crumbled  the black gate was hurled in ruin  and from far away  now dim 
now growing  now mounting to the clouds  there came a drumming rumble  a roar  a
long echoing roll of ruinous noise 
‘the realm of sauron is ended ’ said gandalf  ‘the ring-bearer has
fulfilled his quest ’ and as the captains gazed south to the land of mordor 
it seemed to them that  black against the pall of cloud  there rose a huge shape
of shadow  impenetrable  lightning-crowned  filling all the sky  enormous it
reared above the world  and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand 
terrible but impotent  for even as it leaned over them  a great wind took it 
and it was all blown away  and passed  and then a hush fell 
the captains bowed their heads  and when they looked up again  behold  their
enemies were flying and the power of mordor was scattering like dust in the
wind  as when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits their
crawling hill and holds them all in sway  ants will wander witless and
purposeless and then feebly die  so the creatures of sauron  orc or troll or
beast spell-enslaved  ran hither and thither mindless  and some slew themselves 
or cast themselves in pits  or fled wailing back to
hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope  but the men of rhûn
and of harad  easterling and southron  saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory of the captains of the west  and those that were
deepest and longest in evil servitude  hating the west  and yet were men proud
and bold  in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate
battle  but the most part fled eastward as they could  and some cast their
weapons down and sued for mercy 
then gandalf  leaving all such matters of battle and command to aragorn and
the other lords  stood upon the hill-top and called  and down to him came the
great eagle  gwaihir the windlord  and stood before him 
‘twice you have borne me  gwaihir my friend ’ said gandalf  ‘thrice
shall pay for all  if you are willing  you will not find me a burden much
greater than when you bore me from zirak-zigil  where my old life burned
away ’
‘i would bear you ’ answered gwaihir  ‘whither you will  even were you
made of stone ’
‘then come  and let your brother go with us  and some other of your folk
who is most swift  for we have need of speed greater than any wind  outmatching
the wings of the nazgûl ’
‘the north wind blows  but we shall outfly it ’ said
gwaihir  and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south  and with him went
landroval  and meneldor young and swift  and they passed over udûn and
gorgoroth and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them  and before them
mount doom blazing  pouring out its fire 
‘i am glad that you are here with me ’ said frodo  ‘here at the end of
all things  sam ’
‘yes  i am with you  master ’ said sam  laying frodo’s wounded hand
gently to his breast  ‘and you’re with me  and the journey’s finished  but
after coming all that way i don’t want to give up yet  it’s not like me 
somehow  if you understand ’
‘maybe not  sam ’ said frodo  ‘but it’s like things are in the world 
hopes fail  an end comes  we have only a little time to wait now  we are lost in
ruin and downfall  and there is no escape ’
‘well  master  we could at least go further from this dangerous place here 
from this crack of doom  if that’s its name  now couldn’t we  come  mr 
frodo  let’s go down the path at any rate ’
‘very well  sam  if you wish to go  i’ll come ’ said frodo  and they
rose and went slowly down the winding road  and even as they passed towards the
mountain’s quaking feet  a great smoke and steam belched from the sammath
naur  and the side of the cone was riven open  and a huge fiery vomit rolled in
slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side 
frodo and sam could go no further  their last strength of mind and body was
swiftly ebbing  they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the mountain’s
foot  but from it there was no more escape  it was an island now  not long to
endure  amid the torment of orodruin  all about it the earth gaped  and from
deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up  behind them the mountain was
convulsed  great rents opened in its side  slow rivers of fire came down the
long slopes towards them  soon they would be engulfed  a rain of hot ash was
falling 
they stood now  and sam still holding his master’s hand caressed it  he
sighed  ‘what a tale we have been in  mr  frodo  haven’t we ’ he said 
‘i wish i could hear it told  do you think they’ll say  now comes the
story of nine-fingered frodo and the ring of doom  and then everyone will
hush  like we did  when in rivendell they told us the tale of beren one-hand and
the great jewel  i wish i could hear it  and i wonder how it will go on after
our part ’
but even while he spoke so  to keep fear away until the very last  his eyes
still strayed north  north into the eye of the wind  to where the sky far off
was clear  as the cold blast  rising to a gale  drove back the darkness and the
ruin of the clouds 


and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes  as down the
wild wind he came  and daring the great peril of the skies he circled in the
air  two small dark figures  forlorn  hand in hand upon a little hill  while the
world shook under them  and gasped  and rivers of fire drew near  and even as he
espied them and came swooping down  he saw them fall  worn out  or choked with
fumes and heat  or stricken down by despair at last  hiding their eyes from
death 
side by side they lay  and down swept gwaihir  and down came landroval and
meneldor the swift  and in a dream  not knowing what fate had befallen them  the
wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire 
when sam awoke  he found that he was lying on some soft bed  but over him
gently swayed wide beechen boughs  and through their young leaves sunlight
glimmered  green and gold  all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent 
he remembered that smell  the fragrance of ithilien  ‘bless me ’ he
mused  ‘how long have i been asleep ’ for the scent had borne him back to
the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank  and for a moment
all else between was out of waking memory  he stretched and drew a deep breath 
‘why  what a dream i’ve had ’ he muttered  ‘i am glad to wake ’ he sat
up and then he saw that frodo was lying beside him  and slept peacefully  one
hand behind his head  and the other resting upon the coverlet  it was the right
hand  and the third finger was missing 
full memory flooded back  and sam cried aloud  ‘it wasn’t a dream  then
where are we ’
and a voice spoke softly behind  ‘in the land of ithilien  and in the
keeping of the king  and he awaits you ’ with that gandalf stood before him 
robed in white  his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the
leafy sunlight  ‘well  master samwise  how do you feel ’ he said 
but sam lay back  and stared with open mouth  and for a moment  between
bewilderment and great joy  he could not answer  at last he gasped  ‘gandalf 
i thought you were dead  but then i thought i was dead myself  is everything sad
going to come untrue  what’s happened to the world ’
‘a great shadow has departed ’ said gandalf  and then he laughed and the
sound was like music  or like water in a parched land  and as he listened the
thought came to sam that he had not heard laughter  the pure sound of merriment 
for days upon days without count  it fell upon his ears like the echo of all the
joys he had ever known  but he himself burst into tears  then  as a sweet rain
will pass down a wind of spring and the sun will shine out the clearer  his
tears ceased  and his laughter welled up  and laughing he sprang from his bed 
‘how do i feel ’ he cried  ‘well  i don’t know how to say it  i feel 
i feel’ - he waved his arms in the air - ‘i feel like spring after winter 
and sun on the leaves  and like trumpets and harps and all the songs i have ever
heard ’ he stopped and he turned towards his master  ‘but how’s mr 
frodo ’ he said  ‘isn’t it a shame about his poor hand  but i hope he’s
all right otherwise  he’s had a cruel time ’
‘yes  i am all right otherwise ’ said frodo  sitting up and laughing in
his turn  i fell asleep again waiting for you  sam  you sleepyhead  i was awake
early this morning  and now it must be nearly noon ’
‘noon ’ said sam  trying to calculate  ‘noon of what day ’
‘the fourteenth of the new year ’ said gandalf  ‘or if you like  the
eighth day of april in the shire reckoning « but
in gondor the new year will always now begin upon the twenty-fifth of march when
sauron fell  and when you were brought out of the fire to the king  he has
tended you  and now he awaits you  you shall eat and drink with him  when you
are ready i will lead you to him ’
‘the king ’ said sam  ‘what king  and who is he ’
‘the king of gondor and lord of the western lands ’ said gandalf ‘and
he has taken back all his ancient realm  he will ride soon to his crowning  but
he waits for you ’
‘what shall we wear ’ said sam  for all he could see was the old and
tattered clothes that they had journeyed in  lying folded on the ground beside
their beds 
‘the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor ’ said gandalf  ‘even
the orc-rags that you bore in the black land  frodo  shall be preserved  no
silks and linens  nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable  but later
i will find some other clothes  perhaps ’
then he held out his hands to them  and they saw that one shone with light 
‘what have you got there ’ frodo cried  ‘can it be -  ’
‘yes  i have brought your two treasures  they were found on sam when you
were rescued  the lady galadriel’s gifts  your glass  frodo  and your box 
sam  you will be glad to have these safe again ’
when they were washed and clad  and had eaten a light meal  the hobbits
followed gandalf  they stepped out of the beech-grove in which they had lain 
and passed on to a long green lawn  glowing in sunshine  bordered by stately
dark-leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom  behind them they could hear the
sound of falling water  and a stream ran down before them between flowering
banks  until it came to a greenwood at the lawn’s foot and passed then on
under an archway of trees  through which they saw the shimmer of water far away 
as they came to the opening in the wood  they were surprised to see knights
in bright mail and tall guards in silver and black standing there  who greeted
them with honour and bowed before them  and then one blew a long trumpet  and
they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing stream  so they came
to a wide green land  and beyond it was a broad river in a silver haze  out of
which rose a long wooded isle  and many ships lay by its shores  but on the
field where they now stood a great host was drawn up  in ranks and companies
glittering in the sun  and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed  and
spears were shaken  and horns and trumpets sang  and men cried with many voices
and in many tongues 
‘long live the halflings  praise them with great praise 

cuio i pheriain anann  aglar’ni pheriannath 

praise them with great praise  frodo and samwise 

daur a berhael  conin en annûn  eglerio 

praise them 

eglerio 

a laita te  laita te  andave laituvalmet 

praise them 

cormacolindor  a laita tárienna 

praise them  the ring-bearers  praise them with great praise ’
and so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining with
wonder  frodo and sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host were
set three high-seats built of green turves  behind the seat upon the right
floated  white on green  a great horse running free  upon the left was a banner 
silver upon blue  a ship swan-prowed faring on the sea  but behind the highest
throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in the breeze  and there
a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and seven
glittering stars  on the throne sat a mail-clad man  a great sword was laid
across his knees  but he wore no helm  as they drew near he rose  and then they
knew him  changed as he was  so high and glad of face  kingly  lord of men 
dark-haired with eyes of grey 
frodo ran to meet him  and sam followed close behind  ‘well  if that
isn’t the crown of all ’ he said  ‘strider  or i’m still asleep ’
‘yes  sam  strider ’ said aragorn  ‘it is a long way  is it not  from
bree  where you did not like the look of me  a long way for us all but yours has
been the darkest road ’
and then to sam’s surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before
them  and taking them by the hand  frodo upon his right and sam upon his left 
he led them to the throne  and setting them upon it  he turned to the men and
captains who stood by and spoke  so that his voice rang over all the host 
crying 
‘praise them with great praise ’
and when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again  to sam’s final
and complete satisfaction and pure joy  a minstrel of gondor stood forth  and
knelt  and begged leave to sing  and behold  he said 
‘lo  lords and knights and men of valour unashamed  kings and princes  and
fair people of gondor  and riders of rohan  and ye
sons of elrond  and dúnedain of the north  and elf and dwarf  and
greathearts of the shire  and all free folk of the west  now listen to my lay 
for i will sing to you of frodo of the nine fingers and the ring of doom ’
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight  and he stood up
and cried  ‘o great glory and splendour  and all my wishes have come true ’
and then he wept 
and all the host laughed and wept  and in the midst of their merriment and
tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold  and all men
were hushed  and he sang to them  now in the elven-tongue  now in the speech of
the west  until their hearts  wounded with sweet words  overflowed  and their
joy was like swords  and they passed in thought out to regions where pain and
delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness 
and at the last  as the sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the trees
lengthened  he ended  ‘praise them with great praise ’ he said and knelt 
and then aragorn stood up  and all the host arose  and they passed to pavilions
made ready  to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted 
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent  and there their old
raiment was taken off  but folded and set aside with honour  and clean linen was
given to them  then gandalf came and in his arms  to the wonder of frodo  he
bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from
him in mordor  for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail  and his elven-cloak all
healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered  and then he laid before them
two swords 
‘i do not wish for any sword ’ said frodo 
‘tonight at least you should wear one ’ said gandalf 
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to sam  and had been laid
at his side in cirith ungol  ‘sting i gave to you sam ’ he said 
‘no  master  mr  bilbo gave it to you  and it goes with his silver coat  he
would not wish anyone else to wear it now ’
frodo gave way  and gandalf  as if he were their
esquire  knelt and girt the sword-belts about them  and then rising he set
circlets of silver upon their heads  and when they were arrayed they went to the
great feast  and they sat at the king’s table with gandalf  and king éomer
of rohan  and the prince imrahil and all the chief captains  and there
also were gimli and legolas 
but when  after the standing silence  wine was brought there came in two
esquires to serve the kings  or so they seemed to be  one was clad in the silver
and sable of the guards of minas tirith  and the other in white and green  but
sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men  then
suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly  he exclaimed 
‘why  look mr  frodo  look here  well  if it isn’t pippin  mr  peregrin
took i should say  and mr  merry  how they have grown  bless me  but i can see
there’s more tales to tell than ours ’
‘there are indeed ’ said pippin turning towards him  ‘and we’ll begin
telling them  as soon as this feast is ended  in the meantime you can try
gandalf  he’s not so close as he used to be  though he laughs now more than he
talks  for the present merry and i are busy  we are knights of the city and of
the mark  as i hope you observe ’
at last the glad day ended  and when the sun was gone and the round moon rode
slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves 
frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair
ithilien  and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf 
and after a while legolas and gimli joined them  there frodo and sam learned
much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken
on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls  and still there was always more
to ask and more to tell 
orcs  and talking trees  and leagues of grass  and galloping riders  and
glittering caves  and white towers and golden halls  and battles  and tall ships
sailing  all these passed before sam’s mind until he felt bewildered  but
amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of
merry and pippin  and he made them stand back to back with frodo and himself  he
scratched his head  ‘can’t understand it at your age ’ he said  ‘but
there it is  you’re three inches taller than you ought to he  or i’m a
dwarf ’
‘that you certainly are not ’ said gimli  ‘but what did i say  mortals
cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot
of beer ’
‘ent-draughts ’ said sam  ‘there you go about ents again  but what they
are beats me  why  it will take weeks before we get all these things sized
up ’
‘weeks indeed ’ said pippin  ‘and then frodo will have to be locked up
in a tower in minas tirith and write it all down  otherwise he will forget half
of it  and poor old bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed ’
at length gandalf rose  ‘the hands of the king are hands of healing  dear
friends ’ he said  ‘but you went to the very brink of death ere he recalled
you  putting forth all his power  and sent you into the sweet forgetfulness of
sleep  and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly  still it is now time
to sleep again ’
and not only sam and frodo here  said gimli  but you too  pippin  i love you 
if only because of the pains you have cost me  which i shall never forget  nor
shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle  but for gimli the
dwarf you would have been lost then  but at least i know now the look of a
hobbit’s foot  though it be all that can be seen under a heap of bodies  and
when i heaved that great carcase off you  i made sure you were dead  i could
have  torn out my beard  and it is only a day yet since you were first up and
abroad again  to bed now you go  and so shall i ’
‘and i ’ said legolas  ‘shall walk in the woods of this fair land 
which is rest enough  in days to come  if my elven-lord allows  some of our folk
shall remove hither  and when we come it shall be blessed  for a while  for a
while  a month  a life  a hundred years of men  but anduin is near  and anduin
leads down to the sea  to the sea 
to the sea  to the sea  the white gulls are crying 

the wind is blowing  and the white foam is flying 

west  west away  the round sun is falling 

grey ship  grey ship  do you hear them calling 

the voices of my people that have gone before me 

i will leave  i will leave the woods that bore me 

for our days are ending and our years failing 

i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing 

long are the waves on the last shore falling 

sweet are the voices in the lost isle calling 

in eressëa  in elvenhome that no man can discover 

where the leaves fall not  land of my people for ever ’
and so singing legolas went away down the hill 
then the others also departed  and frodo and sam went to their beds and
slept  and in the morning they rose again in hope
and peace  and they spent many days in ithilien  for the field of cormallen 
where the host was now encamped was near to henneth annûn  and the stream
that flowed from its falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down
through its rocky gate  and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of
anduin by the isle of cair andros  the hobbits wandered here and there visiting
again the places that they had passed before  and sam hoped always in some
shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch  maybe  a glimpse of the great
oliphaunt  and when he learned that at the siege of gondor there had been a
great number of these beasts but that they were all destroyed  he thought it a
sad loss 
‘well  one can’t be everywhere at once  i suppose ’ he said  ‘but i
missed a lot  seemingly ’
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith  the
weary rested and the hurt were healed  for some had laboured and fought much
with the remnants of the easterlings and southrons  until all were subdued  and 
latest of all  those returned who had passed into mordor and destroyed the
fortresses in the north of the land 
but at the last when the month of may was drawing near the captains of the
west set out again  and they went aboard ship with all their men  and they
sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath  and there they remained for
one day  and the day after they came to the green fields of the pelennor and saw
again the white towers under tall mindolluin  the city of the men of gondor 
last memory of westernesse  that had passed through the darkness and fire to a
new day 
and there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and awaited
the morning  for it was the eve of may  and the king would enter his gates with
the rising of the sun 
  
over the city of gondor doubt and great dread had hung  fair weather and
clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days held little hope  and who
looked each morning for news of doom  their lord was dead and burned  dead lay
the king of rohan in their citadel  and the new king that had come to them in
the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark and terrible for any
might or valour to conquer  and no news came  after the host left morgul vale
and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east 
when the captains were but two days gone  the lady éowyn bade the
women who tended her to bring her raiment  and she would not be gainsaid 
but rose  and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen  she
went to the warden of the houses of healing 
‘sir ’ she said  ‘i am in great unrest  and i cannot lie longer in
sloth ’
‘lady ’ he answered  ‘you are not yet healed  and i was commanded to
tend you with especial care  you should not have risen from your bed for seven
days yet  or so i was bidden  i beg you to go back ’
‘i am healed ’ she said  ‘healed at least in body  save my left arm
only  and that is at ease  but i shall sicken anew  if there is naught that i
can do  are there no tidings of war  the women can tell me nothing ’
‘there are no tidings ’ said the warden  ‘save that the lords have
ridden to morgul vale  and men say that the new captain out of the north is
their chief  a great lord is that  and a healer  and it is a thing passing
strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword  it is not thus
in gondor now  though once it was so  if old tales be true  but for long years
we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of swords  though
we should still have enough to do without them  the world is full enough of
hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them ’
it needs but one foe to breed a war  not two 
master warden  answered éowyn  ‘and those who have not swords can still
die upon them  would you have the folk of gondor gather you herbs only  when the
dark lord gathers armies  and it is not always good to be healed in body  nor is
it always evil to die in battle  even in bitter pain  were i permitted 
in this dark hour i would choose the latter ’
the warden looked at her  tall she stood there  her eyes bright in her white
face  her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that opened to
the east  he sighed and shook his head  after a pause she turned to him again 
‘is there no deed to do ’ she said  ‘who commands in this city ’
‘i do not rightly know ’ he answered  ‘such things are not my care 
there is a marshal over the riders of rohan  and
the lord húrin  i am told  commands the men of gondor  but the lord
faramir is by right the steward of the city ’
‘where can i find him ’
‘in this house  lady  he was sorely hurt  but is now set again on the way
to health  but i do not know-‘
‘will you not bring me to him  then you will know ’
the lord faramir was walking alone in the garden of the houses of healing 
and the sunlight warmed him  and he felt life run new in his veins  but his
heart was heavy  and he looked out over the walls
eastward  and coming  the warden spoke his name  and he turned and saw the lady
éowyn of rohan  and he was moved with pity  for he saw that she was hurt 
and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest 
‘my lord ’ said the warden  ‘here is the
lady éowyn of rohan  she rode with the king and was sorely hurt  and
dwells now in my keeping  but she is not content  and she wishes to speak to the
steward of the city ’
‘do not misunderstand him  lord ’ said éowyn  ‘it is not lack of
care that grieves me  no houses could be fairer  for those who desire to
be healed  but i cannot lie in sloth  idle  caged  i looked for death in battle 
but i have not died  and battle still goes on ’
at a sign from faramir  the warden bowed and departed  ‘what would you have
me do  lady ’ said faramir  ‘i also am a prisoner of the healers ’ he
looked at her  and being a man whom pity deeply stirred  it seemed to him that
her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart  and she looked at him and
saw the grave tenderness in his eyes  and yet knew  for she was bred among men
of war  that here was one whom no rider of the mark would outmatch in battle 
‘what do you wish ’ he said again  ‘if it lies in my power  i will do
it ’
‘i would have you command this warden  and bid him let me go ’ she said 
but though her words were still proud  her heart faltered  and for the first
time she doubted herself  she guessed that this tall man  both stern and gentle 
might think her merely wayward  like a child that has not the firmness of mind
to go on with a dull task to the end 
‘i myself am in the warden’s keeping ’ answered faramir  ‘nor have i
yet taken up my authority in the city  but had i done so  i should still listen
to his counsel  and should not cross his will in matters of his craft  unless in
some great need ’
‘but i do not desire healing ’ she said  ‘i wish to ride to war like my
brother éomer  or better like théoden the king  for he died and
has both honour and peace ’
‘it is too late  lady  to follow the captains  even if you had the
strength ’ said faramir  ‘but death in battle may come to us all yet 
willing or unwilling  you will be better prepared to face it in your own manner 
if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded  you and i  we must
endure with patience the hours of waiting ’
she did not answer  but as he looked at her it seemed to him that something
in her softened  as though a bitter frost were yielding at the first faint
presage of spring  a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her cheek  like a
glistening rain-drop  her proud head drooped a little  then quietly  more as if
speaking to herself than to him  ‘but the healers would have me lie abed seven
days yet ’ she said  ‘and my window does not look eastward ’ her voice was
now that of a maiden young and sad 
faramir smiled  though his heart was filled with pity  ‘your window does
not look eastward ’ he said  ‘that can be amended  in this i will command
the warden  if you will stay in this house in our care  lady  and take your
rest  then you shall walk in this garden in the sun  as you will  and you shall
look east  whither all our hopes have gone  and here you will find me  walking
and waiting  and also looking east  it would ease my care  if you would speak to
me  or walk at whiles with me ’
then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again  and a colour came
in her pale face  ‘how should i ease your care  my lord ’ she said  ‘and i
do not desire the speech of living men ’
‘would you have my plain answer ’ he said 
‘i would ’
‘then  éowyn of rohan  i say to you that you are beautiful 
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright  and maidens
fairer still  but neither flower nor lady have i seen till now in gondor so
lovely  and so sorrowful  it may be that only a few days are left ere darkness
falls upon our world  and when it comes i hope to face it steadily  but it would
ease my heart  if while the sun yet shines  i could see you still  for you and i
have both passed under the wings of the shadow  and the same hand drew us
back ’
‘alas  not me  lord ’ she said  ‘shadow lies on me still  look not to
me for healing  i am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle  but i thank you for
this at least  that i need not keep to my chamber  i will walk abroad by the
grace of the steward of the city ’ and she did him a courtesy and walked back
to the house  but faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden  and his
glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls 
when he returned to his chamber he called for the warden  and heard all that
he could tell of the lady of rohan 
‘but i doubt not  lord ’ said the warden  ‘that you would learn more
from the halfling that is with us  for he was in the riding of the king  and
with the lady at the end  they say ’
and so merry was sent to faramir  and while that
day lasted they talked long together  and faramir learned much  more even than
merry put into words  and he thought that he understood now something of the
grief and unrest of éowyn of rohan  and in the fair evening faramir
and merry walked in the garden  but she did not come 
but in the morning  as faramir came from the houses  he saw her  as she stood
upon the walls  and she was clad all in white  and gleamed in the sun  and he
called to her  and she came down  and they walked on the grass or sat under a
green tree together  now in silence  now in speech  and each day after they did
likewise  and the warden looking from his window was glad in heart  for he was a
healer  and his care was lightened  and certain it was that  heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of men  still these two of
his charges prospered and grew daily in strength 
and so the fifth day came since the lady éowyn went first to faramir 
and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the city and
looked out  no tidings had yet come  and all hearts were darkened  the weather 
too  was bright no longer  it was cold  a wind that had sprung up in the night
was blowing now keenly from the north  and it was rising  but the lands about
looked grey and drear 
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks  and over all the lady
éowyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer-night  and it
was set with silver stars about hem and throat  faramir had sent for this
robe and had wrapped it about her  and he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side  the mantle was wrought for his
mother  finduilas of amroth  who died untimely  and was to him but a memory of
loveliness in far days and of his first grief  and
her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of éowyn 
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle  and she looked northward 
above the grey hither lands  into the eye of the cold wind where far away the
sky was hard and clear 
‘what do you look for  éowyn ’ said faramir 
‘does not the black gate lie yonder ’ said she  ‘and must he not now be
come thither  it is seven days since he rode away ’
‘seven days ’ said faramir  ‘but think not ill of me  if i say to
you  they have brought me both a joy and a pain that i never thought to know 
joy to see you  but pain  because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are
grown dark indeed  éowyn  i would not have this world end now  or lose so
soon what i have found ’
‘lose what you have found  lord ’ she answered  but she looked at him
gravely and her eyes were kind  ‘i know not what in these days you have found
that you could lose  but come  my friend  let us not speak of it  let us not
speak at all  i stand upon some dreadful brink  and it is utterly dark in the
abyss before my feet  but whether there is any light behind me i cannot tell 
for i cannot turn yet  i wait for some stroke of doom ’
‘yes  we wait for the stroke of doom ’ said faramir  and they said no
more  and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died  and
the light failed  and the sun was bleared  and all sounds in the city or in the
lands about were hushed  neither wind  nor voice  nor bird-call  nor rustle of
leaf  nor their own breath could be heard  the very beating of their hearts was
stilled  time halted 
and as they stood so  their hands met and clasped  though they did not know
it  and still they waited for they knew not what  then presently it seemed to
them that above the ridges of the distant mountains another vast mountain of
darkness rose  towering up like a wave that should engulf the world  and about
it lightnings flickered  and then a tremor ran through the earth  and they felt
the walls of the city quiver  a sound like a sigh went up from all the lands
about them  and their hearts beat suddenly again 
‘it reminds me of númenor ’ said faramir  and wondered to hear
himself speak 
‘of númenor ’ said éowyn 
‘yes ’ said faramir  ‘of the land of westernesse that foundered and of
the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills  and
coming on  darkness unescapable  i often dream of it ’
‘then you think that the darkness is coming ’ said éowyn 
‘darkness unescapable ’ and suddenly she drew close to him 
‘no ’ said faramir  looking into her face  ‘it was but a picture in the
mind  i do not know what is happening  the reason of my waking mind tells me
that great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days  but my heart says
nay  and all my limbs are light  and a hope and joy
are come to me that no reason can deny  éowyn  éowyn  white lady
of rohan  in this hour i do not believe that any darkness will endure ’ and he
stooped and kissed her brow 
and so they stood on the walls of the city of gondor  and a great wind rose
and blew  and their hair  raven and golden  streamed out mingling in the air 
and the shadow departed  and the sun was unveiled  and light leaped forth  and
the waters of anduin shone like silver  and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what source they could not
tell 
and before the sun had fallen far from the noon out of the east there came a
great eagle flying  and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of the west 
crying 
sing now  ye people of the tower of anor 

for the realm of sauron is ended for ever 

and the dark tower is thrown down 



sing and rejoice  ye people of the tower of guard 

for your watch hath not been in vain 

and the black gate is broken 

and your king hath passed through 

and he is victorious 



sing and be glad  all ye children of the west 

for your king shall come again 

and he shall dwell among you

all the days of your life 



and the tree that was withered shall be renewed 

and he shall plant it in the high places 

and the city shall be blessed 



sing all ye people 
and the people sang in all the ways of the city 
the days that followed were golden  and spring and summer joined and made
revel together in the fields of gondor  and tidings now came by swift riders
from cair andros of all that was done  and the city made ready for the coming of
the king  merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of
goods to osgiliath and thence by ship to cair andros  but faramir did not go 
for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the stewardship 
although it was only for a little while  and his duty was to prepare for one who
should replace him 
and éowyn did not go  though her brother sent word begging her to come
to the field of cormallen  and faramir wondered at this  but he saw her
seldom  being busy with many matters  and she dwelt still in the houses of
healing and walked alone in the garden  and her face grew pale again  and it
seemed that in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful  and the warden of
the houses was troubled  and he spoke to faramir 
then faramir came and sought her  and once more they stood on the walls
together  and he said to her  ‘éowyn  why do you tarry here  and do not
go to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros  where your brother
awaits you ’
and she said  ‘do you not know ’
but he answered  ‘two reasons there may be  but which is true  l do not
know ’
and she said  ‘i do not wish to play at riddles  speak plainer ’
‘then if you will have it so  lady ’ he said  ‘you do not go  because
only your brother called for you  and to look on the lord aragorn  elendil’s
heir  in his triumph would now bring you no joy  or because i do not go  and you
desire still to be near me  and maybe for both these reasons 
and you yourself cannot choose between them  éowyn  do you not love me 
or will you not ’
‘i wished to be loved by another ’ she answered  ‘but i desire no
man’s pity ’
‘that i know ’ he said  ‘you desired to have the love of the lord
aragorn  because he was high and puissant  and you wished to have renown and
glory and to be lifted far above the mean things that crawl on the earth  and as
a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable  for so he is 
a lord among men  the greatest that now is  but
when he gave you only understanding and pity  then you desired to have nothing 
unless a brave death in battle  look at me  éowyn ’
and éowyn looked at faramir long and steadily  and faramir said  ‘do
not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart  éowyn  but i do not
offer you my pity  for you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won
renown that shall not be forgotten  and you are a lady beautiful  i deem  beyond
even the words of the elven-tongue to tell  and i love you  once i pitied your
sorrow  but now  were you sorrowless  without fear or any lack  were you the
blissful queen of gondor  still i would love you  éowyn  do you not love
me ’
then the heart of éowyn changed  or else at last she understood it 
and suddenly her winter passed  and the sun shone on her 
i stand in minas anor  the tower of the sun  she said  and behold the shadow
has departed  i will be a shieldmaiden no longer  nor vie with the great riders 
nor take joy only in the songs of slaying  i will be a healer  and love all
things that grow and are not barren ’ and again she looked at faramir  ‘no
longer do i desire to be a queen ’ she said 
then faramir laughed merrily  ‘that is well ’ he said  ‘for i am not a
king  yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan  if it be her will  and if she
will  then let us cross the river and in happier days let us dwell in fair
ithilien and there make a garden  all things will grow with joy there  if the
white lady comes ’
‘then must i leave my own people  man of gondor ’ she said  ‘and would
you have your proud folk say of you  “there goes
a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of the north  was there no woman of the
race of númenor to choose ”’
‘i would ’ said faramir  and he took her in his arms and kissed her under
the sunlit sky  and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the
sight of many  and many indeed saw them and the light that shone about them as
they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the houses of healing 
and to the warden of the houses faramir said 
‘here is the lady éowyn of rohan  and now she is healed ’
and the warden said  ‘then i release her from my charge and bid her
farewell  and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again  i commend her to the
care of the steward of the city  until her brother returns ’
but éowyn said  ‘yet now that i have leave to depart  i would
remain  for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed ’
and she remained there until king éomer came 
all things were now made ready in the city  and there was great concourse of
people  for the tidings had gone out into all parts of gondor  from min-rimmon
even to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea  and all that could come to
the city made haste to come  and the city was filled again with women and fair
children that returned to their homes laden with flowers  and from dol amroth
came the harpers that harped most skilfully in all the land  and there were
players upon viols and upon flutes and upon horns of silver  and clear-voiced
singers from the vales of lebennin 
at last an evening came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen upon
the field  and all night lights were burning as men watched for the dawn  and
when the sun rose in the clear morning above the mountains in the east  upon
which shadows lay no more  then all the bells rang  and all the banners broke
and flowed in the wind  and upon the white tower of the citadel the standard of
the stewards  bright argent like snow in the sun  bearing no charge nor device 
was raised over gondor for the last time 
now the captains of the west led their host towards the city  and folk saw
them advance in line upon line  flashing and glinting in the sunrise and
rippling like silver  and so they came before the gateway and halted a furlong
from the walls  as yet no gates had been set up
again  but a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city  and there stood
men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn  before the barrier stood
faramir the steward  and húrin warden of the keys  and other captains of
gondor  and the lady éowyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many
knights of the mark  and upon either side of the gate was a great press of fair
people in raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers 
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith  and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the
soldiers of gondor and of rohan  and by the people of the city and of all parts
of the land  a hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the dúnedain
in silver and grey  and before them came walking slow the lord aragorn 
he was clad in black mail girt with silver  and he wore a long mantle of pure
white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar 
but his head was bare save for a star upon his
forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver  with him were éomer of
rohan  and the prince imrahil  and gandalf robed all in white  and four small
figures that many men marvelled to see 
‘nay  cousin  they are not boys ’ said ioreth to her kinswoman from
imloth melui  who stood beside her  ‘those are periain  out of the far
country of the halflings  where they are princes of great fame  it is said  i
should know  for i had one to tend in the houses  they are small  but they are
valiant  why  cousin  one of them went with only his esquire into the black
country and fought with the dark lord all by himself  and set fire to his tower 
if you can believe it  at least that is the tale in the city  that will be the
one that walks with our elfstone  they are dear friends  i hear  now he is a
marvel  the lord elfstone  not too soft in his speech  mind you  but he has a
golden heart  as the saying is  and he has the healing hands  “the hands of
the king are the hands of a healer”  i said  and that was how it was all
discovered  and mithrandir  he said to me  “ioreth  men will long remember
your words”  and-‘
but ioreth was not permitted to continue the instruction of her kinswoman
from the country  for a single trumpet rang  and a dead silence followed  then
forth from the gate went faramir with húrin of the keys  and no others 
save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and armour of the
citadel  and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound
with silver 
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled  and he knelt  and
said  ‘the last steward of gondor begs leave to surrender his office ’ and
he held out a white rod  but aragorn took the rod and gave it back  saying 
‘that office is not ended  and it shall be thine and thy heirs’ as long as
my line shall last  do now thy office ’
then faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice  ‘men of gondor hear now
the steward of this realm  behold  one has come to claim the kingship again at
last  here is aragorn son of arathorn  chieftain of
the dúnedain of arnor  captain of the host of the west  bearer of the
star of the north  wielder of the sword reforged  victorious in battle  whose
hands bring healing  the elfstone  elessar of the line of valandil  isildur’s
son  elendil’s son of númenor  shall he be king and enter into
the city and dwell there ’
and all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice 
and ioreth said to her kinswoman  ‘this is just a ceremony such as we have
in the city  cousin  for he has already entered  as i was telling you  and he
said to me-‘ and then again she was obliged to silence  for faramir spoke
again 
‘men of gondor  the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that the
king should receive the crown from his father ere he died  or if that might not
be  that he should go alone and take it from the hands of his father in the tomb
where he was laid  but since things must now be done otherwise  using the
authority of the steward  i have today brought hither from rath dínen the
crown of eärnur the last king  whose days passed in the time of our
longfathers of old ’
then the guards stepped forward  and faramir opened the casket  and he held
up an ancient crown  it was shaped like the helms of the guards of the citadel 
save that it was loftier  and it was all white  and the wings at either side
were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of a sea-bird  for
it was the emblem of kings who came over the sea  and seven gems of adamant were
set in the circlet  and upon its summit was set a single jewel the light of
which went up like a flame 
then aragorn took the crown and held it up and said 
et eärello endorenna utúlien  sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn’
ambar-metta 
and those were the words that elendil spoke when he came up out of the sea on
the wings of the wind  ‘out of the great sea to middle-earth i am come  in
this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world ’
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not put the crown upon his head  but
gave it back to faramir  and said  ‘by the labour and valour of many i have
come into my inheritance  in token of this i would have the ring-bearer bring
the crown to me  and let mithrandir set it upon my head  if he will  for he has
been the mover of all that has been accomplished  and this is his victory ’
then frodo came forward and took the crown from faramir and bore it to
gandalf  and aragorn knelt  and gandalf set the white crown upon his head  and
said 
‘now come the days of the king  and may they be blessed while the thrones
of the valar endure ’
but when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence  for it seemed to
them that he was revealed to them now for the first time  tall as the sea-kings
of old  he stood above all that were near  ancient of days he seemed and yet in
the flower of manhood  and wisdom sat upon his brow  and strength and healing
were in his hands  and a light was about him  and then faramir cried 
‘behold the king ’
and in that moment all the trumpets were blown  and the king elessar went
forth and came to the barrier  and húrin of
the keys thrust it back  and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and
the singing of clear voices the king passed through the flower-laden streets 
and came to the citadel  and entered in  and the banner of the tree and
the stars was unfurled upon the topmost tower  and the reign of king elessar
began  of which many songs have told 
in his time the city was made more fair than it had ever been  even in the
days of its first glory  and it was filled with trees and with fountains  and
its gates were wrought of mithril and steel  and its streets were paved with
white marble  and the folk of the mountain laboured in it  and the folk of the
wood rejoiced to come there  and all was healed and made good  and the houses
were filled with men and women and the laughter of children  and no window was
blind nor any courtyard empty  and after the ending of the third age of the
world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that
were gone 
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat on his throne in the hall
of the kings and pronounced his judgements  and embassies came from many lands
and peoples  from the east and the south  and from the borders of mirkwood  and
from dunland in the west  and the king pardoned the
easterlings that had given themselves up  and sent them away free  and he made
peace with the peoples of harad  and the slaves of mordor he released and gave
to them all the lands about lake núrnen to be their own  and there were
brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their
valour  and last the captain of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged 
and the king said to beregond  ‘beregond  by your sword blood was spilled
in the hallows  where that is forbidden  also you left your post without leave
of lord or of captain  for these things  of old  death was the penalty  now
therefore i must pronounce your doom 
‘all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle  and still more because
all that you did was for the love of the lord faramir  nonetheless you must
leave the guard of the citadel  and you must go forth from the city of minas
tirith ’
then the blood left beregond’s face  and he was stricken to the heart and
bowed his head  but the king said  
‘so it must be  for you are appointed to the white company  the guard of
faramir  prince of ithilien  and you shall be its captain and dwell in emyn
arnen in honour and peace  and in the service of him for whom you risked all  to
save him from death ’
and then beregond  perceiving the mercy and justice of the king  was glad 
and kneeling kissed his hand  and departed in joy and content  and aragorn gave
to faramir ithilien to be his princedom  and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn
arnen within sight of the city 
‘for ’ said he  ‘minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed 
and though it may in time to come be made clean  no man may dwell there for many
long years ’
and last of all aragorn greeted éomer of rohan  and they embraced  and
aragorn said  ‘between us there can be no word of giving or taking  nor
of reward  for we are brethren  in happy hour did eorl ride from the north  and
never has any league of peoples been more blessed  so that neither has ever
failed the other  nor shall fail  now  as you know  we
have laid théoden the renowned in a tomb in the hallows  and there he
shall lie for ever among the kings of gondor  if you will  or if you desire it 
we will come to rohan and bring him back to rest with his own people ’
and éomer answered  ‘since the day when you rose before me
out of the green grass of the downs i have loved you  and that love shall not
fail  but now i must depart for a while to my own realm  where there is much to
heal and set in order  but as for the fallen  when all is made ready we will
return for him  but here let him sleep a while ’
and éowyn said to faramir  ‘now i must go back to my own land and
look on it once again  and help my brother in his labour  but when one whom i
long loved as father is laid at last to rest  i will return ’
so the glad days passed  and on the eighth day of may the riders of rohan
made ready  and rode off by the north-way  and with them went the sons of
elrond  all the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them 
from the gate of the city to the walls of the pelennor  then all others that
dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing  but in the city there was labour
of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war
and the memory of the darkness 
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith  with legolas and gimli  for
aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved  ‘at last all such things
must end ’ he said  ‘but i would have you wait a little while longer  for
the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come  a day draws near
that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood  and when it comes i would
have my friends beside me ’ but of that day he would say no more 
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house with
gandalf  and they went to and fro as they wished  and frodo said to gandalf 
‘do you know what this day is that aragorn speaks of  for we are happy here 
and i don’t wish to go  but the days are running away  and bilbo is waiting 
and the shire is my home ’
‘as for bilbo ’ said gandalf  ‘he is waiting for the same day  and he
knows what keeps you  and as for the passing of the days  it is now only may and
high summer is not yet in  and though all things may seem changed  as if an age
of the world had gone by  yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year
since you set out ’
‘pippin ’ said frodo  ‘didn’t you say that gandalf was less close
than of old  he was weary of his labours then  i think  now he is recovering ’
and gandalf said  ‘many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on
the table  but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their
secret  for wonder makes the words of praise louder  and aragorn himself waits
for a sign ’
there came a day when gandalf could not be found  and the companions wondered
what was going forward  but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night  and
he brought him to the southern feet of mount mindolluin  and there they found a
path made in ages past that few now dared to tread  for it led up on to the
mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go  and they
went up by steep ways  until they came to a high field below the snows that clad
the lofty peaks  and it looked down over the precipice that stood behind the
city  and standing there they surveyed the lands  for the morning was come  and
they saw the towers of the city far below them like white pencils touched by the
sunlight  and all the vale of anduin was like a garden  and the mountains of
shadow were veiled in a golden mist  upon the one side their sight reached to
the grey emyn muil  and the glint of rauros was like a star twinkling far off 
and upon the other side they saw the river like a ribbon laid down to pelargir 
and beyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the sea 
and gandalf said  ‘this is your realm  and the heart of the greater realm
that shall be  the third age of the world is ended  and the new age is begun 
and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may be
preserved  for though much has been saved  much must now pass away  and the
power of the three rings also is ended  and all the lands that you see  and
those that lie round about them  shall be dwellings of men  for the time comes
of the dominion of men  and the elder kindred shall fade or depart ’
‘i know it well  dear friend ’ said aragorn  ‘but i would still have
your counsel ’
‘not for long now ’ said gandalf  ‘the third age was my age  i was the
enemy of sauron  and my work is finished  i shall go soon  the burden must lie
now upon you and your kindred ’
‘but i shall die ’ said aragorn  ‘for i am a mortal man  and though
being what i am and of the race of the west unmingled  i shall have life far
longer than other men  yet that is but a little while  and when those who are
now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old  i too shall grow old  and
who then shall govern gondor and those who look to this city as to their queen 
if my desire be not granted  the tree in the court of the fountain is still
withered and barren  when shall i see a sign that it will ever be otherwise ’
‘turn your face from the green world  and look where all seems barren and
cold ’ said gandalf 
then aragorn turned  and there was a stony slope behind him running down from
the skirts of the snow  and as he looked he was aware that alone there in the
waste a growing thing stood  and he climbed to it  and saw that out of the very
edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than three foot high 
already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely  dark above and silver
beneath  and upon its slender crown it bore one small cluster of flowers whose
white petals shone like the sunlit snow 
then aragorn cried  ‘yé  utúvienyes 
i have found it  lo  here is a scion of the eldest of trees  but how comes it
here  for it is not itself yet seven years old ’
and gandalf coming looked at it  and said  ‘verily this is a sapling of the
line of nimloth the fair  and that was a seedling of galathilion  and that a
fruit of telperion of many names  eldest of trees  who shall say how it comes
here in the appointed hour  but this is an ancient hallow  and ere the kings
failed or the tree withered in the court  a fruit must have been set here  for
it is said that  though the fruit of the tree comes seldom to ripeness  yet the
life within may then lie sleeping through many long years  and none can foretell
the time in which it will awake  remember this  for if ever a fruit ripens  it
should be planted  lest the line die out of the world  here it has lain  hidden
on the mountain  even as the race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the
north  yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line  king elessar ’
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling  and lo  it seemed to hold
only lightly to the earth  and it was removed
without hurt  and aragorn bore it back to the citadel  then the withered tree
was uprooted  but with reverence  and they did not burn it  but laid it to rest
in the silence of rath dínen  and aragorn planted the new tree in
the court by the fountain  and swiftly and gladly it began to grow  and when the
month of june entered in it was laden with blossom 
‘the sign has been given ’ said aragorn  ‘and the day is not far
off ’ and he set watchmen upon the walls 
it was the day before midsummer when messengers came from amon din to the
city  and they said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the north  and
they drew near now to the walls of the pelennor  and the king said  ‘at last
they have come  let all the city be made ready ’
upon the very eve of midsummer  when the sky was blue as sapphire and white
stars opened in the east  but the west was still golden and the air was cool and
fragrant  the riders came down the north-way to the gates of minas tirith  first
rode elrohir and elladan with a banner of silver 
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household of rivendell  and
after them came the lady galadriel and celeborn  lord of lothlórien 
riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land 
grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair  and last came master elrond  mighty
among elves and men  bearing the sceptre of annúminas  and beside him
upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter  evenstar of her people 
and frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening  with stars on her
brow and a sweet fragrance about her  was moved with great wonder  and he said
to gandalf  ‘at last i understand why we have waited  this is the ending  now
not day only shall be beloved  but night too shall be beautiful and blessed and
all its fear pass away ’
then the king welcomed his guests  and they alighted  and elrond surrendered
the sceptre  and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the king  and
together they went up into the high city  and all the stars
flowered in the sky  and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undómiel
in the city of the kings upon the day of midsummer  and the tale of their long
waiting and labours was come to fulfilment 
 
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the companions thought of
returning to their own homes  and frodo went to the king as he was sitting with
the queen arwen by the fountain  and she sang a song of valinor  while the tree
grew and blossomed  they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him  and aragorn said 
‘i know what you have come to say  frodo  you wish to return to your own
home  well  dearest friend  the tree grows best in the land of its sires  but
for you in all the lands of the west there will ever be a welcome  and though
your people have had little fame in the legends of the great  they will now have
more renown than any wide realms that are no more ’
‘it is true that i wish to go back to the shire ’ said frodo  ‘but
first i must go to rivendell  for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed  i missed bilbo  and i was grieved when among all the household of
elrond i saw that he was not come ’
‘do you wonder at that  ring-bearer ’ said arwen  ‘for you know the
power of that thing which is now destroyed  and all that was done by that power
is now passing away  but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you  he
is ancient in years now  according to his kind  and he awaits you  for he will
not again make any long journey save one ’
‘then i beg leave to depart soon ’ said frodo 
‘in seven days we will go ’ said aragorn  ‘for we shall ride with you
far on the road  even as far as the country of rohan  in three days now éomer
will return hither to bear théoden back to rest in the mark  and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen  but now before you go i will confirm
the words that faramir spoke to you  and you are made free for ever of the realm
of gondor  and all your companions likewise  and if there were any gifts that i
could give to match with your deeds you should have them  but whatever you
desire you shall take with you  and you shall ride in honour and arrayed as
princes of the land ’
but the queen arwen said  ‘a gift i will give you  for i am the daughter of
elrond  i shall not go with him now when he departs
to the havens  for mine is the choice of lúthien  and as she so have i
chosen  both the sweet and the bitter  but in my stead you shall go 
ring-bearer  when the time comes  and if you then desire it  if your hurts
grieve you still and the memory of your burden is heavy  then you may
pass into the west  until all your wounds and weariness are healed  but wear
this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar with whom your life has been
woven ’
and she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging upon a
silver chain  and she set the chain about frodo’s neck  ‘when the memory of
the fear and the darkness troubles you ’ she said  ‘this will bring you
aid ’
in three days  as the king had said  éomer of rohan came riding to the
city  and with him came an éored
of the fairest knights of the mark  he was welcomed  and when they sat all at
table in merethrond  the great hall of feasts  he beheld the beauty of the
ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder  and before he went to his
rest he sent for gimli the dwarf  and he said to
him  ‘gimli glóin’s son  have you your axe ready ’
‘nay  lord ’ said gimli  ‘but i can speedily fetch it  if there be
need ’
‘you shall judge ’ said éomer  ‘for there are certain rash words
concerning the lady in the golden wood that lie still between us  and now
i have seen her with my eyes ’
‘well  lord ’ said gimli  ‘and what say you now ’
‘alas ’ said éomer  ‘i will not say that she is the fairest lady
that lives ’
‘then i must go for my axe ’ said gimli 
‘but first i will plead this excuse ’ said
éomer  ‘had i seen her in other company  i would have said all that you
could wish  but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first  and i am ready to do
battle on my own part with any who deny me  shall i call for my sword ’
then gimli bowed low  ‘nay  you are excused for my part  lord ’ he said 
‘you have chosen the evening  but my love is given to the morning  and my
heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever ’
at last the day of departure came  and a great and fair
company made ready to ride north from the city  then the kings of gondor and
rohan went to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath dínen  and
they bore away king théoden upon a golden bier  and passed through the
city in silence  then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan
all about it and his banner borne before  and merry being théoden’s
esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king 
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature 
and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side  and gandalf rode upon shadowfax 
and pippin rode with the knights of gondor  and legolas and gimli as ever rode
together upon arod 
in that riding went also queen arwen  and celeborn and galadriel with their
folk  and elrond and his sons  and the princes of
dol amroth and of ithilien  and many captains and knights  never had any king of
the mark such company upon the road as went with théoden thengel’s son
to the land of his home 
without haste and at peace they passed into anórien 
and they came to the grey wood under amon din  and there they heard a
sound as of drums beating in the hills  though no living thing could be seen 
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown  and heralds cried 
‘behold the king elessar is come  the forest
of drúadan he gives to ghân-buri-ghân and to his folk  to be
their own for ever  and hereafter let no man enter it without their leave ’
then the drums rolled loudly  and were silent 
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of king théoden
passed through the green fields of rohan and came to edoras  and there they all
rested  the golden hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled with
light  and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the days of
its building  for after three days the men of the
mark prepared the funeral of théoden  and he was laid in a house of stone
with his arms and many other fair things that he had possessed  and over him was
raised a great mound  covered with green turves of grass and of white
evermind  and now there were eight mounds on the east-side of the barrowfield 
then the riders of the king’s house upon white horses rode round about the
barrow and sang together a song of théoden thengel’s son that gléowine
his minstrel made  and he made no other song after  the slow voices of
the riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that
people  but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the
mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves
of the north and the voice of eorl crying above the battle upon the field of
celebrant  and the tale of the kings rolled on  and the horn of helm was loud in
the mountains  until the darkness came and king théoden arose and rode
through the shadow to the fire  and died in splendour  even as the sun 
returning beyond hope  gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning 
out of doubt  out of dark  to the day’s rising

he rode singing in the sun  sword unsheathing 

hope he rekindled  and in hope ended 

over death  over dread  over doom lifted

out of loss  out of life  unto long glory 
but merry stood at the foot of the green mound  and he wept  and when the
song was ended he arose and cried 
‘théoden king  théoden king  farewell  as a father you were
to me  for a little while  farewell ’
when the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled  and théoden
was left at last alone in his barrow  then folk gathered to the golden hall for
the great feast and put away sorrow  for théoden had lived to full years
and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires  and when the time
came that in the custom of the mark they should drink to the memory of the
kings  éowyn lady of rohan came forth  golden as the sun and white as
snow  and she bore a filled cup to éomer 
then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the lords
of the mark in their order  eorl the young  and brego builder of the hall  and
aldor brother of baldor the hapless  and fréa  and fréawine  and
goldwine  and déor  and gram  and helm who lay hid in helm’s deep when
the mark was overrun  and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side  for in that
time the line was broken  and after came the mounds of the east-side  fréalaf 
helm s sister-son  and léofa  and walda  and folca  and folcwine  and
fengel  and thengel  and théoden the latest  and when théoden was
named éomer drained the cup  then éowyn bade those that served to
fill the cups  and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king  crying 
‘hail  éomer  king of the mark ’
at the last when the feast drew to an end éomer arose and said  ‘now
this is the funeral feast of théoden the king  but i will speak ere we go
of tidings of joy  for he would not grudge that i should do so  since he was
ever a father of éowyn my sister  hear then all my guests  fair folk of
many realms  such as have never before been gathered in this hall  faramir 
steward of gondor  and prince of ithilien  asks that éowyn lady of rohan
should be his wife  and she grants it full willing  therefore they shall
be trothplighted before you all ’
and faramir and éowyn stood forth and set hand in hand  and all there
drank to them and were glad  ‘thus ’ said éomer  ‘is the friendship
of the mark and of gondor bound with a new bond  and the more do i rejoice ’
‘no niggard are you  éomer ’ said
aragorn  ‘to give thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm ’
then éowyn looked in the eyes of aragorn  and she said  ‘wish me
joy  my liege-lord and healer ’
and he answered  ‘i have wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee  it
heals my heart to see thee now in bliss ’
when the feast was over  those who were to go took leave of king éomer 
aragorn and his knights  and the people of lórien and of rivendell  made
ready to ride  but faramir and imrahil remained at edoras  and arwen
evenstar remained also  and she said farewell to her brethren  none saw her last
meeting with elrond her father  for they went up into the hills and there spoke
long together  and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends
of the world 
at the last before the guests set oat éomer and éowyn came to
merry  and they said  ‘farewell now  meriadoc of the shire and holdwine of the
mark  ride to good fortune  and ride back soon to our welcome ’
and éomer said  ‘kings of old would have laden you with gifts
that a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of mundburg  and yet
you will take naught  you say  but the arms that were given to you  this i
suffer  for indeed i have no gift that is worthy  but my sister begs you to
receive this small thing  as a memorial of dernhelm and of the horns of the mark
at the coming of the morning ’
then éowyn gave to merry an ancient horn  small but cunningly wrought
all of fair silver with a baldric of green  and wrights had engraven upon it swift
horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the mouth  and
there were set runes of great virtue 
‘this is an heirloom of our house ’ said éowyn  ‘it was made by
the dwarves  and came from the hoard of scatha the worm  eorl the young
brought it from the north  he that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts
of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends  and they shall hear him and
come to him ’
then merry took the horn  for it could not be refused  and he kissed éowyn’s
hand  and they embraced him  and so they parted for that time 
now the guests were ready  and they drank the stirrup-cup  and with great
praise and friendship they departed  and came at length to helm’s deep  and
there they rested two days  then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went
with him to the glittering caves  and when they returned he was silent  and
would say only that gimli alone could find fit words to speak of them  ‘and
never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over an elf in a contest of words ’
said he  ‘now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the score right ’
from deeping-coomb they rode to isengard  and saw how the ents had busied
themselves  all the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed  and the land
within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees  and a stream ran
through it  but in the midst of all there was a lake of clear water  and out of
it the tower of orthanc rose still  tall and impregnable  and its black rock was
mirrored in the pool 
for a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of isengard had
stood  and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a
green-bordered path that ran towards orthanc  and they looked in wonder at the
work that had been done  but no living thing could they see far or near  but
presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom  hoom-hom  and there
came treebeard striding down the path to greet them with quickbeam at his side 
‘welcome to the treegarth of orthanc ’ he said  ‘i knew that you were
coming  but i was at work up the valley  there is much still to be done  but you
have not been idle either away in the south and the east  i hear  and all that i
hear is good  very good ’ then treebeard praised all their deeds  of which he
seemed to have full knowledge  and at last he stopped and looked long at
gandalf 
‘well  come now ’ he said  ‘you have proved mightiest  and all your
labours have gone well  where now would you be going  and why do you come
here ’
‘to see how your work goes  my friend ’ said gandalf  ‘and to thank you
for your aid in all that has been achieved ’
‘hoom
‘and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out on
the wold  for they had not heard of us before  though that might be said also of
better folk  and not many will remember us  for not many escaped us alive  and
the river had most of those  but it was well for you  for if they had not met
us  then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far  and if he had
there would have been no home to return to ’
‘we know it well ’ said aragorn  ‘and never shall it be forgotten in
minas tirith or in edoras ’
‘never is too long a word even for me ’ said treebeard  ‘not
while your kingdoms last  you mean  but they will have to last long indeed to
seem long to ents ’
‘the new age begins ’ said gandalf  ‘and in this age it may well prove
that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you  fangorn my friend  but now come tell
me  what of the task that i set you  how is saruman  is he not weary of orthanc
yet  for i do not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from his
windows ’
treebeard gave gandalf a long look  a most cunning look  merry thought 
‘ah ’ he said  ‘i thought you would come to that  weary of orthanc  very
weary at last  but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice  hoom 
i gave him some long tales  or at least what might be thought long in your
speech ’
‘then why did he stay to listen  did you go into orthanc ’ asked gandalf 
‘hoom
‘l observe  my good fangorn ’ said gandalf  ‘that with great care you
say dwelt  was  grew  what about is  is he dead ’
‘no  not dead  so far as i know ’ said treebeard  ‘but he is gone  yes 
he is gone seven days  i let him go  there was little left of him when he
crawled out  and as for that worm-creature of his  he was like a pale shadow 
now do not tell me  gandalf  that i promised to keep him safe  for i know it 
but things have changed since then  and i kept him until he was safe  safe from
doing any more harm  you should know that above all i hate the caging of live
things  and i will not keep even such creatures as these caged beyond great
need  a snake without fangs may crawl where he will ’
‘you may be right ’ said gandalf  ‘but this snake had still one tooth
left  i think  he had the poison of his voice  and i guess that he persuaded
you  even you treebeard  knowing the soft spot in your heart  well  he is gone 
and there is no more to be said  but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
king  to whom it belongs  though maybe he will not need it ’
‘that will be seen later ’ said aragorn  ‘but i will give to ents all
this valley to do with as they will  so long as they keep a watch upon orthanc
and see that none enter it without my leave ’
‘it is locked ’ said treebeard  ‘i made saruman lock it and give me the
keys  quickbeam has them ’
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to aragorn two
great black keys of intricate shape  joined by a ring of steel  ‘now i thank
you once more ’ said aragorn  ‘and i bid you farewell  may your forest grow
again in peace  when this valley is filled there is room and to spare west of
the mountains  where once you walked long ago ’
treebeard’s face became sad  ‘forests may grow ’ he said  ‘woods may
spread  but not ents  there are no entings ’
‘yet maybe there is now more hope in your search ’ said aragorn  ‘lands
will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed ’
but treebeard shook his head and said  ‘it is far to go  and there are too
many men there in these days  but i am forgetting my manners  will you stay here
and rest a while  and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through
fangorn forest and so shorten their road home ’ he looked at celeborn and
galadriel 
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart 
either south or west  ‘come  gimli ’ said legolas  ‘now by fangorn’s
leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are
nowhere else to be found in middle-earth  you shall come with me and keep your
word  and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and
beyond ’ to this gimli agreed  though with no great delight  it seemed 
‘here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the ring ’ said
aragorn  ‘yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help
that you promised ’
‘we will come  if our own lords allow it ’ said gimli  ‘well  farewell 
my hobbits  you should come safe to your own homes now  and i shall not be kept
awake for fear of your peril  we will send word when we may  and some of us may
yet meet at times  but i fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever
again ’
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn  and he bowed three
times slowly and with great reverence to celeborn and galadriel  ‘it is long 
long since we met by stock or by stone  a vanimar  vanimálion
nostari ’ he said  ‘it is sad that we should meet only thus at the
ending  for the world is changing  i feel it in the water  i feel it in the
earth  and i smell it in the air  i do not think we shall meet again ’
and celeborn said  ‘i do not know  eldest ’ but galadriel said  ‘not in
middle-earth  nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again 
then in the willow-meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring  farewell ’
last of all merry and pippin said good-bye to the old ent  and he grew gayer
as he looked at them  ‘well  my merry folk ’ he said  ‘will you drink
another draught with me before you go ’
‘indeed we will ’ they said  and he took them aside into the shade of one
of the trees  and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set  and
treebeard filled three bowls  and they drank  and they saw his strange eyes
looking at them over the rim of his bowl  ‘take care take care ’ he said 
‘for you have already grown since i saw you last ’ and they laughed and
drained their bowls 
‘well  good-bye ’ he said  ‘and don’t forget that if you hear any
news of the entwives in your land  you will send word to me ’ then he waved
his great hands to all the company and went off into the trees 


the travellers now rode with more speed  and they made their way towards the gap
of rohan  and aragorn took leave of them at last close to that very place where
pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc  the hobbits were grieved at this
parting  for aragorn had never failed them and he had been their guide through
many perils 
‘i wish we could have a stone that we could see all our friends in ’ said
pippin  ‘and that we could speak to them from far away ’
‘only one now remains that you could use ’ answered aragorn
for you would not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you  but
the palantír of orthanc the king will keep  to see what is passing in his
realm  and what his servants are doing  for do not forget  peregrin took  that
you are a knight of gondor  and i do not release you from your service 
you are going now on leave  but i may recall you  and remember  dear friends of
the shire  that my realm lies also in the north  and i shall come there one
day ’
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel  and the lady said to him 
‘elfstone  through darkness you have come to your hope  and have now all your
desire  use well the days ’
but celeborn said  ‘kinsman  farewell  may your doom be other than mine 
and your treasure remain with you to the end ’
with that they parted  and it was then the time of sunset  and when after a
while they turned and looked back  they saw the king of the west sitting upon
his horse with his knights about him  and the falling sun shone upon them and
made all their harness to gleam like red gold  and the white mantle of aragorn
was turned to a flame  then aragorn took the green stone and held it up  and
there came a green fire from his hand 
soon the dwindling company  following the isen  turned west and rode through
the gap into the waste lands beyond  and then they turned northwards  and passed
over the borders of dunland  the dunlendings fled and hid themselves  for they
were afraid of elvish folk  though few indeed ever came to their country  but
the travellers did not heed them  for they were still a great company and were
well provided with all that they needed  and they went on their way at their
leisure  setting up their tents when they would 
on the sixth day since their parting from the king they journeyed through a
wood climbing down from the hills at the feet of the misty mountains that now
marched on their right hand  as they came out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff  and he was clothed in rags
of grey or dirty white  and at his heels went another beggar  slouching and
whining 
‘well saruman ’ said gandalf  ‘where are you going ’
‘what is that to you ’ he answered  ‘will you still order my goings 
and are you not content with my ruin ’
‘you know the answers ’ said gandalf  ‘no and no  but in any case the
time of my labours now draws to an end  the king has taken on the burden  if you
had waited at orthanc  you would have seen him  and he would have shown you
wisdom and mercy ’
‘then all the à more reason to have left sooner ’ said
saruman  ‘for i desire neither of him  indeed if you wish for an answer to
your first question  i am seeking a way out of his realm ’
‘then once more you are going the wrong way ’ said gandalf  ‘and i see
no hope in your journey  but will you scorn our help  for we offer it to you ’
‘to me ’ said saruman  ‘nay  pray do not smile at me  i prefer your
frowns  and as for the lady here  i do not trust her  she always hated me  and
schemed for your part  i do not doubt that she has brought you this way to have
the pleasure of gloating over my poverty  had i been warned of your pursuit  i
would have denied you the pleasure ’
‘saruman ’ said galadriel  ‘we have other errands and other cares that
seem to us more urgent than hunting for you  say rather that you are overtaken
by good fortune  for now you have a last chance ’
‘if it be truly the last  i am glad ’ said saruman  ‘for i shall be
spared the trouble of refusing it again  all my hopes are ruined  but i would
not share yours  if you have any ’
for a moment his eyes kindled  ‘go ’ he said  ‘i did not spend long
study on these matters for naught  you have doomed yourselves  and you know it 
and it will afford me some comfort as i wander to think that you pulled down
your own house when you destroyed mine  and now  what ship will bear you back
across so wide a sea ’ he mocked  ‘it will be a grey ship  and full of
ghosts ’ he laughed  but his voice was cracked and hideous 
‘get up  you idiot ’ he shouted to the other beggar  who had sat down on
the ground  and he struck him with his staff  ‘turn about  if these fine folk
are going our way  then we will take another  get on  or i’ll give you no
crust for your supper ’
the beggar turned and slouched past whimpering  ‘poor old gríma 
poor old gríma  always beaten and cursed  how i hate him  i wish i
could leave him ’
‘then leave him ’ said gandalf 
but wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at
gandalf  and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman  as the wretched pair
passed by the company they came to the hobbits  and saruman stopped and stared
at them  but they looked at him with pity 
‘so you have come to gloat too  have you  my urchins ’ he said  ‘you
don’t care what a beggar lacks  do you  for you have all you want  food and
fine clothes  and the best weed for your pipes  oh yes  i know  i know where it
comes from  you would not give a pipeful to a beggar  would you ’
‘i would  if i had any ’ said frodo 
‘you can have what i have got left ’ said merry  ‘if you will wait a
moment ’ he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle  then he handed to
saruman a leather pouch  ‘take what there is ’ he said  ‘you are welcome
to it  it came from the flotsam of isengard ’
‘mine  mine  yes and dearly bought ’ cried saruman  clutching at the
pouch  ‘this is only a repayment in token  for you took more  i’ll be bound 
still  a beggar must be grateful  if a thief returns him even a morsel of his
own  well  it will serve you right when you come home  if you find things less
good in the southfarthing than you would like  long may your land be short of
leaf ’
‘thank you ’ said merry  ‘in that case i will have my pouch back  which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me  wrap the weed in a rag of your
own ’
‘one thief deserves another ’ said saruman  and turned his back on merry 
and kicked wormtongue  and went away towards the wood 
‘well  i like that ’ said pippin  ‘thief indeed  what of our claim for
waylaying  wounding  and orc-dragging us through rohan ’
‘ah ’ said sam  ‘and bought he said  how  i wonder  and i
didn’t like the sound of what he said about the southfarthing  it’s time we
got back ’
‘i’m sure it is ’ said frodo  ‘but we can’t go any quicker  if we
are to see bilbo  i am going to rivendell first  whatever happens ’
‘yes  i think you had better do that ’ said gandalf  ‘but alas for
saruman  i fear nothing more can be made of him  he has withered altogether  all
the same  i am not sure that treebeard is right  i fancy he could do some
mischief still in a small mean way ’
next day they went on into northern dunland  where no men now dwelt  though
it was a green and pleasant country  september came in with golden days and
silver nights  and they rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river  and
found the old ford  east of the falls where it went down suddenly into the
lowlands  far to the west in a haze lay the meres and eyots through which it
wound its way to the greyflood  there countless swans housed in a land of reeds 
so they passed into eregion  and at last a fair morning dawned  shimmering
above gleaming mists  and looking from their camp on a low hill the travellers
saw away in the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up into the sky
through floating clouds  caradhras  celebdil  and fanuidhol  they were near to
the gates of moria 
here now for seven days they tarried  for the time was at hand for another
parting which they were loth to make  soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk
would turn eastward  and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the dimrill stair
to the silverlode and to their own country  they had journeyed thus far by the
west-ways  for they had much to speak of with elrond and with gandalf  and here
they lingered still in converse with their friends  often long after the hobbits
were wrapped in sleep they would sit together under the stars  recalling the
ages that were gone and all their joys and labours in the world  or holding
council  concerning the days to come  if any wanderer had chanced to pass 
little would he have seen or heard  and it would have seemed to him only that he
saw grey figures  carved in stone  memorials of forgotten things now lost in
unpeopled lands  for they did not move or speak with mouth  looking from mind to
mind  and only their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to
and fro 
but at length all was said  and they parted again for a while  until it was
time for the three rings to pass away  quickly fading into the stones and the
shadows the grey-cloaked people of lórien rode towards the mountains 
and those who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and watched  until there
came out of the gathering mist a flash  and then they saw no more  frodo knew
that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell 
sam turned away and sighed  ‘i wish i was
going back to lórien ’
at last one evening they came over the high moors  suddenly as to travellers
it always seemed  to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and saw far below
the lamps shining in elrond’s house  and they went down and crossed the bridge
and came to the doors  and all the house was filled with light and song for joy
at elrond’s homecoming 
first of all  before they had eaten or washed or even shed their cloaks  the
hobbits went in search of bilbo  they found him all alone in his little room  it
was littered with papers and pens and pencils  but bilbo was sitting in a chair
before a small bright fire  he looked very old  but peaceful  and sleepy 
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in  ‘hullo  hullo ’ he
said  ‘so you’ve come back  and tomorrow’s my birthday  too  how clever of
you  do you know  i shall be one hundred and twenty-nine  and in one year more 
if i am spared  i shall equal the old took  i should like to beat him  but we
shall see ’
after the celebration of bilbo’s birthday the four hobbits stayed in
rivendell for some days  and they sat much with their old friend  who spent most
of his time now in his room  except at meals  for these he was still very
punctual as a rule  and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them  sitting
round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of their
journeys and adventures  at first he pretended to take some notes  but he often
fell asleep  and when he woke he would say  ‘how splendid  how wonderful  but
where were we ’ then they went on with the story from the point where he had
begun to nod 
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention was the
account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn  ‘i was invited to the wedding
of course ’ he said  ‘and i have waited for it long enough  but somehow 
when it came to it  i found i had so much to do here  and packing is such a
bother ’
when nearly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out of his window and saw
that there had been a frost in the night  and the cobwebs were like white nets 
then suddenly he knew that he must go  and say good-bye to bilbo  the weather
was still calm and fair  after one of the most lovely summers that people could
remember  but october had come  and it must break soon and begin to rain and
blow again  and there was still a very long way to go  yet it was not really the
thought of the weather that stirred him  he had a feeling that it was time he
went back to the shire  sam shared it  only the night before he had said 
‘well  mr  frodo  we’ve been far and seen a deal  and yet i don’t think
we’ve found a better place than this  there’s something of everything here 
if you understand me  the shire and the golden wood and gondor and kings’
houses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed  and yet  somehow  i feel we
ought to be going soon  i’m worried about my gaffer  to tell you the truth ’
‘yes  something of everything  sam  except the sea ’ frodo had answered 
and he repeated it now to himself  ‘except the sea ’
that day frodo spoke to elrond  and it was agreed that they should leave the
next morning  to their delight gandalf said  ‘i think i shall come too  at
least as far as bree  i want to see butterbur ’
in the evening they went to say good-bye to bilbo  ‘well  if you must go 
you must ’ he said  ‘i am sorry  i shall miss you  it is nice just to know
that you are about the place  but i am getting very sleepy ’ then he gave
frodo his mithril-coat and sting  forgetting that he had already done so  and he
gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times  written in
his spidery hand  and labelled on their red backs  translations from the
elvish  by b b 
to sam he gave a little bag of gold  ‘almost the last drop of the smaug
vintage ’ he said  ‘may come in useful  if you think of getting married 
sam ’ sam blushed 
‘i have nothing much to give to you young fellows ’ he said to merry and
pippin  ‘except good advice ’ and when he had given them a fair sample of
this  he added a last item in shire-fashion  ‘don’t let your heads get too
big for your hats  but if you don’t finish growing up soon  you are going to
find hats and clothes expensive ’
‘but if you want to beat the old took ’ said pippin  ‘i don’t see why
we shouldn’t try and beat the bullroarer ’
bilbo laughed  and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with pearl
mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver  ‘think of me when you smoke
them ’ he said  ‘the elves made them for me  but i don’t smoke now ’ and
then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little  and when he woke up
again he said  ‘now where were we  yes  of course  giving presents  which
reminds me  what’s become of my ring  frodo  that you took away ’
‘i have lost it  bilbo dear ’ said frodo  ‘i got rid of it  you
know ’
‘what a pity ’ said bilbo  ‘i should have liked to see it again  but
no  how silly of me  that’s what you went for  wasn’t it  to get rid of it 
but it is all so confusing  for such a lot of other things seem to have got
mixed up with it  aragorn’s affairs  and the white council and gondor  and the
horsemen  and southrons  and oliphaunts - did you really see one  sam  - and
caves and towers and golden trees  and goodness knows what besides 
‘i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip  i think
gandalf might have shown me round a bit  but then the auction would have been
over before i got back  and i should have had even more trouble than i did 
anyway it’s too late now  and really i think it’s much more comfortable to
sit here and hear about it all  the fire’s very cosy here  and the food’s
very good  and there are elves when you want them  what more could one want 
the road goes ever on and on

out from the door where it began 

now far ahead the road has gone 

let others follow it who can 

let them a journey new begin 

but i at last with weary feet

will turn towards the lighted inn 

my evening-rest and sleep to meet ’
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and he
slept soundly 
the evening deepened in the room  and the firelight burned brighter  and they
looked at bilbo as he slept and saw that his face was smiling  for some time
they sat in silence  and then sam looking round at the room and the shadows
flickering on the walls  said softly 
‘i don’t think  mr  frodo  that he’s done much writing while we’ve
been away  he won’t ever write our story now ’
at that bilbo opened an eye  almost as if he had heard  then he roused
himself  ‘you see  i am getting so sleepy ’ he said  ‘and when i have time
to write  i only really like writing poetry  i wonder  frodo my dear fellow  if
you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go  collect all my
notes and papers  and my diary too  and take them with you  if you will  you
see  i haven’t much time for the selection and the arrangement and all that 
get sam to help  and when you’ve knocked things into shape  come back  and
i’ll run over it  i won’t be too critical ’
‘of course i’ll do it ’ said frodo  ‘and of course i’ll come back
soon  it won’t be dangerous any more  there is a real king now and he will
soon put the roads in order ’
‘thank you  my dear fellow ’ said bilbo  ‘that really is a very great
relief to my mind ’ and with that he fell fast asleep again 
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took leave of bilbo in his room  for it
was cold out of doors  and then they said farewell to elrond and all his
household 
as frodo stood upon the threshold  elrond wished him a fair journey  and
blessed him  and he said 
‘i think  frodo  that maybe you will not need to come back  unless you come
very soon  for about this time of the year  when the leaves are gold before they
fall  look for bilbo in the woods of the shire  i shall be with him ’
these words no one else heard  and frodo kept them to himself 
 
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home  they were eager now
to see the shire again  but at first they rode only slowly  for frodo had been
ill at ease  when they came to the ford of bruinen  he had halted  and seemed
loth to ride into the stream  and they noted that for a while his eyes appeared
not to see them or things about him  all that day he was silent  it was the
sixth of october 
‘are you in pain  frodo ’ said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodo’s
side 
‘well  yes i am ’ said frodo  ‘it is my shoulder  the wound aches  and
the memory of darkness is heavy on me  it was a year ago today ’
‘alas  there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured ’ said gandalf 
‘i fear it may be so with mine ’ said frodo  ‘there is no real going
back  though i may come to the shire  it will not seem the same  for i shall not
be the same  i am wounded with knife  sting  and tooth  and a long burden  where
shall i find rest ’
gandalf did not answer 
by the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed  and frodo was
merry again  as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before 
after that the journey went well  and the days went quickly by  for they rode at
leisure  and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yellow in the autumn sun  at length they came to weathertop  and it was then
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road  then
frodo begged them to hasten  and he would not look towards the hill  but rode
through its shadow with head bowed and cloak drawn close about him  that night
the weather changed  and a wind came from the west laden with rain  and it blew
loud and chill  and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air  when they
came to the chetwood already the boughs were almost bare  and a great curtain of
rain veiled bree hill from their sight 
so it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last days of
october the five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the south-gate
of bree  it was locked fast  and the rain blew in their faces  and in the
darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by  and their hearts sank a little  for
they had expected more welcome 
when they had called many times  at last the gate-keeper came out  and they
saw that he carried a great cudgel  he looked at them with fear and suspicion 
but when he saw that gandalf was there  and that his companions were hobbits  in
spite of their strange gear  then he brightened and wished them welcome 
‘come in ’ he said  unlocking the gate  ‘we won’t stay for news out
here in the cold and the wet  a ruffianly evening  but old barley will no doubt
give you a welcome at the pony  and there you’ll hear all there is to
hear ’
‘and there you’ll hear later all that we say  and more ’ laughed
gandalf  ‘how is harry ’
the gate-keeper scowled  ‘gone ’ he said  ‘but you’d best ask
barliman  good evening ’
‘good evening to you ’ they said  and passed through  and then they
noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been built 
and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the fence  when
they came to bill ferny’s house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and
unkempt  and the windows were all boarded up 
‘do you think you killed him with that apple  sam ’ said pippin 
‘i’m not so hopeful  mr  pippin ’ said sam  ‘but i’d like to know
what became of that poor pony  he’s been on my mind many a time and the wolves
howling and all ’
at last they came to the prancing pony  and that at least looked
outwardly unchanged  and there were lights behind the red curtains in the lower
windows  they rang the bell  and nob came to the door  and opened it a crack and
peeped through  and when he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of
surprise 
‘mr  butterbur  master ’ he shouted  ‘they’ve come back ’
‘oh have they  i’ll learn them ’ came butterbur’s voice  and out he
came with a rush  and he had a club in his hand  but when he saw who they were
he stopped short  and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight 
‘nob  you woolly-pated ninny ’ he cried  ‘can’t you give old friends
their names  you shouldn’t go scaring me like that  with times as they are 
well  well  and where have you come from  i never expected to see any of you
folk again  and that’s a fact  going off into the wild with that strider  and
all those black men about  but i’m right glad to see you  and none more than
gandalf  come in  come in  the same rooms as - before  they’re free  indeed
most rooms are empty these days  as i’ll not hide from you  for you’ll find
it out soon enough  and i’ll see what can be done about supper  as soon as may
be  but i’m short-handed at present  hey  nob you slowcoach  tell bob  ah  but
there i’m forgetting  bob’s gone  goes home to his folk at nightfall now 
well  take the guests’ ponies to the stables  nob  and you’ll be taking your
horse to his stable yourself gandalf  i don’t doubt  a fine beast  as i said
when i first set eyes on him  well  come in  make yourselves at home ’
mr  butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking  and still
seemed to live in his old breathless bustle  and yet there was hardly anybody
about  and all was quiet  from the common room there came a low murmur of no
more than two or three voices  and seen closer in the light of two candles that
he lit and carried before them the landlord’s face looked rather wrinkled and
careworn 
he led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used on that
strange night more than a year ago  and they followed him  a little disquieted 
for it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting a brave face on some
trouble  things were not what they had been  but they said nothing  and waited 
as they expected mr  butterbur came to the parlour after supper to see if all
had been to their liking  as indeed it had  no change for the worse had yet come
upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate  ‘now i won’t
make so bold as to suggest you should come to the common room tonight ’ said
butterbur  ‘you’ll be tired  and there isn’t many folk there this evening 
anyway  but if you could spare me half an hour before you go to your beds  i
would dearly like to have some talk with you  quiet-like by ourselves ’
‘that is just what we should like  too ’ said gandalf  ‘we are not
tired  we have been taking things easy  we were wet  cold and hungry  but all
that you have cured  come  sit down  and if you have any pipe-weed  we’ll
bless you ’
‘well  if you’d called for anything else  i’d have been happier ’
said butterbur  ‘that’s just a thing that we’re short of  seeing how
we’ve only got what we grow ourselves  and that’s not enough  there’s none
to be had from the shire these days  but i’ll do what i can ’
when he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two  a wad
of uncut leaf  ‘southlinch ’ he said  ‘and the best we have  but not the
match of southfarthing  as i’ve always said though i’m all for bree in most
matters  begging your pardon ’
they put him in a large chair by the wood-fire  and gandalf sat on the other
side of the hearth  and the hobbits in low chairs between them  and then they
talked for many times half an hour  and exchanged all such news as mr  butterbur
wished to hear or give  most of the things which they had to tell were a mere
wonder and bewilderment to their host  and far beyond his vision  and they
brought forth few comments other than  ‘you don’t say  often repeated in
defiance of the evidence of mr  butterbur’s own ears  ‘you don’t say  mr 
baggins  or is it mr  underhill  i’m getting so mixed up  you don’t say 
master gandalf  well i never  who’d have thought it in our times ’
but he did say much on his own account  things were far from well  he would
say  business was not even fair  it was downright bad  ‘no one comes nigh bree
now from outside ’ he said  ‘and the inside folks  they stay at home mostly
and keep their doors barred  it all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that
began coming up the greenway last year  as you may remember  but more came
later  some were just poor bodies running away from trouble  but most were bad
men  full o’ thievery and mischief  and there was trouble right here in bree 
bad trouble  why  we had a real set-to  and there were some folk killed  killed
dead  if you’ll believe me ’
‘i will indeed ’ said gandalf  ‘how many ’
‘three and two ’ said butterbur  referring to the big folk and the
little  ‘there was poor mat heathertoes  and rowlie appledore  and little tom
pickthorn from over the hill  and willie banks from up-away  and one of the
underhills from staddle  all good fellows  and they’re missed  and harry
goatleaf that used to be on the west-gate  and that bill ferny  they came in on
the strangers’ side  and they’ve gone off with them  and it’s my belief
they let them in  on the night of the fight  i mean  and that was after we
showed them the gates and pushed them out  before the year’s end  that was 
and the fight was early in the new year  after the heavy snow we had 
‘and now they’re gone for robbers and live outside  hiding in the woods
beyond archet  and out in the wilds north-away  it’s like a bit of the bad old
times tales tell of  i say  it isn’t safe on the road and nobody goes far  and
folk lock up early  we have to keep watchers all round the fence and put a lot
of men on the gates at nights ’
‘well  no one troubled us ’ said pippin  ‘and we came along slowly  and
kept no watch  we thought we’d left all trouble behind us ’
‘ah  that you haven’t  master  more’s the pity ’ said butterbur 
‘but it’s no wonder they left you alone  they wouldn’t go for armed folk 
with swords and helmets and shields and all  make them think twice  that would 
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you ’
then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with
amazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their
gear  they themselves had become so used to warfare and to riding in
well-arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail
peeping from under their cloaks  and the helms of gondor and the mark  and the
fair devices on their shields  would seem outlandish in their own country  and
gandalf  too  was now riding on his tall grey horse  all clad in white with a
great mantle of blue and silver over all  and the long sword glamdring at his
side 
gandalf laughed  ‘well  well ’ he said  ‘if they are afraid of just
five of us  then we have met worse enemies on our travels  but at any rate they
will give you peace at night while we stay ’
‘how long will that be ’ said butterbur  ‘i’ll not deny we should be
glad to have you about for a bit  you see  we’re not used to such troubles 
and the rangers have all gone away  folk tell me  i don’t think we’ve
rightly understood till now what they did for us  for there’s been worse than
robbers about  wolves were howling round the fences last winter  and there’s
dark shapes in the woods  dreadful things that it makes the blood run cold to
think of  it’s been very disturbing  if you understand me ’
‘i expect it has ’ said gandalf  ‘nearly all lands have been disturbed
these days  very disturbed  but cheer up  barliman  you have been on the edge of
very great troubles  and i am only glad to hear that you have not been deeper
in  but better times are coming  maybe  better than any you remember  the
rangers have returned  we came back with them  and there is a king again 
barliman  he will soon be turning his mind this way 
‘then the greenway will be opened again  and his messengers will come
north  and there will be comings and goings  and the evil things will be driven
out of the waste-lands  indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer  and
there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness ’
mr  butterbur shook his head  ‘if there’s a few decent respectable folk
on the roads  that won’t do no harm ’ he said  ‘but we don’t want no
more rabble and ruffians  and we don’t want no outsiders at bree  nor near
bree at all  we want to be let alone  i don’t want a whole crowd o’
strangers camping here and settling there and tearing up the wild country ’
‘you will be let alone  barliman ’ said gandalf  ‘there is room enough
for realms between isen and greyflood  or along the shore lands south of the
brandywine  without any one living within many days’ ride of bree  and many
folk used to dwell away north  a hundred miles or more from here  at the far end
of the greenway  on the north downs or by lake evendim ’
‘up away by deadmen’s dike ’ said butterbur  looking even more dubious 
‘that’s haunted land  they say  none but a robber would go there ’
‘the rangers go there ’ said gandalf  ‘deadmen’s dike  you say  so it
has been called for long years  but its right name  barliman  is fornost erain 
norbury of the kings  and the king will come there again one day  and then
you’ll have some fair folk riding through ’
‘well  that sounds more hopeful  i’ll allow ’ said butterbur  ‘and it
will be good for business  no doubt  so long as he lets bree alone ’
‘he will ’ said gandalf  ‘he knows it and loves it ’
‘does he now ’ said butterbur looking puzzled  ‘though i’m sure i
don’t know why he should  sitting in his big chair up in his great castle 
hundreds of miles away  and drinking wine out of a golden cup  i shouldn’t
wonder  what’s the pony to him  or mugs o’ beer  not but what my
beer’s good  gandalf  it’s been uncommon good  since you came in the autumn
of last year and put a good word on it  and that’s been a comfort in trouble 
i will say ’
‘ah ’ said sam  ‘but he says your beer is always good ’
‘he says ’
‘of course he does  he’s strider  the chief of the rangers  haven’t you
got that into your head yet ’
it went in at last  and butterbur’s face was a study in wonder  the eyes in
his broad face grew round  and his mouth opened wide  and he gasped 
‘strider ’ he exclaimed when he got back his breath  ‘him with a crown and
all and a golden cup  well  what are we coming to ’
‘better times  for bree at any rate ’ said gandalf 
‘i hope so  i’m sure ’ said butterbur  ‘well  this has been the
nicest chat i’ve had in a month of mondays  and i’ll not deny that i’ll
sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart  you’ve given me a powerful lot
to think over  but i’ll put that off until tomorrow  i’m for bed  and i’ve
no doubt you’ll be glad of your beds too  hey  nob ’ he called  going to the
door  ‘nob  you slowcoach ’
‘now ’ he said to himself  slapping his forehead  ‘now what does that
remind me of ’
‘not another letter you’ve forgotten  i hope  mr  butterbur ’ said
merry 
‘now  now  mr  brandybuck  don’t go reminding me of that  but there 
you’ve broken my thought  now where was i  nob  stables  ah  that was it 
i’ve something that belongs to you  if you recollect bill ferny and the
horsethieving  his pony as you bought  well  it’s here  come back all of
itself  it did  but where it had been to you know better than me  it was as
shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail  but it was alive  nob’s
looked after it ’
‘what  my bill ’ cried sam  ‘well  i was born lucky  whatever my gaffer
may say  there’s another wish come true  where is he ’ sam would not go to
bed until he had visited bill in his stable 
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day  and mr  butterbur could not
complain of his business next evening at any rate  curiosity overcame all fears 
and his house was crowded  for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the
common room in the evening and answered a good many questions  bree memories
being retentive  frodo was asked many times if he had written his book 
‘not yet ’ he answered  ‘i am going home now to put my notes in
order ’ he promised to deal with the amazing events at bree  and so give a bit
of interest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and
less important affairs ‘away south’ 
then one of the younger folk called for a song  but at that a hush fell  and
he was frowned down  and the call was not repeated  evidently there was no wish
for any uncanny events in the common room again 
no trouble by day  nor any sound by night  disturbed the peace of bree while
the travellers remained there  but the next morning they got up early  for as
the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire before night  and it
was a long ride  the bree folk were all out to see them off  and were in merrier
mood than they had been for a year  and those who had not seen the strangers in
all their gear before gaped with wonder at them  at gandalf with his white
beard  and the light that seemed to gleam from him  as if his blue mantle was
only a cloud over sunshine  and at the four hobbits like riders upon errantry
out of almost forgotten tales  even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the king began to think there might be some truth in it 
‘well  good luck on your road  and good luck to your home-coming  said mr 
butterbur  ‘i should have warned you before that all’s not well in the shire
neither  if what we hear is true  funny goings on  they say  but one thing
drives out another  and i was full of my own troubles  but if i may be so bold 
you’ve come back changed from your travels  and you look now like folk as can
deal with troubles out of hand  i don’t doubt you’ll soon set all to rights 
good luck to you  and the oftener you come back the better i’ll be pleased ’
they wished him farewell and rode away  and passed through the west-gate and
on towards the shire  bill the pony was with them  and as before he had a good
deal of baggage  but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content 
‘i wonder what old barliman was hinting at ’ said frodo 
‘i can guess some of it ’ said sam gloomily  ‘what i saw in the mirror 
trees cut down and all  and my old gaffer turned out of the row  i ought to have
hurried back quicker ’
‘and something’s wrong with the southfarthing evidently ’ said merry 
‘there’s a general shortage of pipe-weed ’
‘whatever it is ’ said pippin  ‘lotho will be at the bottom of it  you
can be sure of that ’
‘deep in  but not at the bottom ’ said gandalf  ‘you have forgotten
saruman  he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did ’
‘well  we’ve got you with us ’ said merry  ‘so things will soon be
cleared up ’
‘i am with you at present ’ said gandalf  ‘but soon i shall not be  i
am not coming to the shire  you must settle its affairs yourselves  that is what
you have been trained for  do you not yet understand  my time is over  it is no
longer my task to set things to rights  nor to help folk to do so  and as for
you  my dear friends  you will need no help  you are grown up now  grown indeed
very high  among the great you are  and i have no longer any fear at all for any
of you 
‘but if you would know  i am turning aside soon  i am going to have a long
talk with bombadil  such a talk as i have not had in all my time  he is a
moss-gatherer  and i have been a stone doomed to rolling  but my rolling days
are ending  and now we shall have much to say to one another ’
in a little while they came to the point on the east road where they had
taken leave of bombadil  and they hoped and half expected to see him standing
there to greet them as they went by  but there was no sign of him  and there was
a grey mist on the barrow-downs southwards  and a deep veil over the old forest
far away 
they halted and frodo looked south wistfully  ‘i should dearly like to see
the old fellow again ’ he said  ‘i wonder how he is getting on ’
‘as well as ever  you may be sure ’ said gandalf  ‘quite untroubled and
i should guess  not much interested in anything that we have done or seen 
unless perhaps in our visits to the ents  there may be a time later for you to
go and see him  but if i were you  i should press on now for home  or you will
not come to the brandywine bridge before the gates are locked ’
‘but there aren’t any gates ’ said merry  ‘not on the road  you know
that quite well  there’s the buckland gate  of course  but they’ll let me
through that at any time ’
‘there weren’t any gates  you mean ’ said gandalf  ‘i think you will
find some now  and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than
you think  but you’ll  manage all right  good-bye dear friends  not for the
last time  not yet  good-bye ’
he turned shadowfax off the road  and the great horse leaped the green dike
that here ran beside it  and then at a cry from gandalf he was gone  racing
towards the barrow-downs like a wind from the north 
‘well here we are  just the four of us that started out together ’ said
merry  ‘we have left all the rest behind  one after another  it seems almost
like a dream that has slowly faded ’
‘not to me ’ said frodo  ‘to me it feels more like falling asleep
again ’
 
it was after nightfall when  wet and tired  the travellers came at last to
the brandywine  and they found the way barred  at either end of the bridge there
was a great spiked gate  and on the further side of the river they could see
that some new houses had been built  two-storeyed with narrow straight-sided
windows  bare and dimly lit  all very gloomy and un-shirelike 
they hammered on the outer gate and called  but there was at first no answer 
and then to their surprise someone blew a horn  and the lights in the windows
went out  a voice shouted in the dark 
‘who’s that  be off  you can’t come in  can’t you read the notice  no
admittance between sundown and sunrise ’
‘of course we can’t read the notice in the dark ’ sam shouted back 
‘and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like
this  i’ll tear down your notice when i find it ’
at that a window slammed  and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of
the house on the left  they opened the further gate  and some came over the
bridge  when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened 
‘come along ’ said merry  recognizing one of the hobbits  ‘if you
don’t know me  hob hayward  you ought to  i am merry brandybuck  and i should
like to know what all this is about  and what a bucklander like you is doing
here  you used to be on the hay gate ’
‘bless me  it’s master merry  to be sure  and all dressed up for
fighting ’ said old hob  ‘why  they said you was dead  lost in the old
forest by all accounts  i’m pleased to see you alive after all ’
‘then stop gaping at me through the bars  and open the gate ’ said merry 
‘i’m sorry  master merry  but we have orders ’
‘whose orders ’
‘the chief’s up at bag end ’
‘chief  chief  do you mean mr  lotho ’ said frodo 
‘i suppose so  mr  baggins  but we have to say just “the chief”
nowadays ’
‘do you indeed ’ said frodo  ‘well  i am glad he has dropped the
baggins at any rate  but it is evidently high time that the family dealt with
him and put him in his place ’
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate  ‘it won’t do no good talking
that way ’ said one  ‘he’ll get to hear of it  and if you make so much
noise  you’ll wake the chief’s big man ’
‘we shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him ’ said merry  ‘if
you mean that your precious chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild  then
we’ve not come back too soon ’ he sprang from his pony  and seeing the
notice in the light of the lanterns  he tore it down and threw it over the gate 
the hobbits backed away and made no move to open it  ‘come on  pippin ’ said
merry  ‘two is enough ’
merry and pippin climbed the gate  and the hobbits fled  another horn
sounded  out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared
against a light in the doorway 
‘what’s all this ’ he snarled as he came forward  ‘gate-breaking  you
clear out  or i’ll break your filthy little necks ’ then he stopped  for he
had caught the gleam of swords 
‘bill ferny ’ said merry  ‘if you don’t open that gate in ten
seconds  you’ll regret it  i shall set steel to you  if you don’t obey  and
when you have opened the gates you will go through them and never return  you
are a ruffian and a highway-robber ’
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it  ‘give me the
key ’ said merry  but the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted out
into the darkness  as he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his heels
and just caught him as he ran  he went off with a yelp into the night and was
never heard of again 
‘neat work  bill ’ said sam  meaning the pony 
‘so much for your big man ’ said merry  ‘we’ll see the chief later 
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night  and as you seem to have pulled
down the bridge inn and built this dismal place instead  you’ll have to put us
up ’
‘i am sorry  mr  merry ’ said hob  ‘but it isn’t allowed ’
‘what isn’t allowed ’
taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food  and all that  said hob 
‘what’s the matter with the place ’ said merry  ‘has it been a bad
year  or what  i thought it had been a fine summer and harvest ’
‘well no  the year’s been good enough ’ said hob  ‘we grows a lot of
food  but we don’t rightly know what becomes of it  it’s all these
“gatherers” and “sharers”  i reckon  going round counting and measuring
and taking off to storage  they do more gathering than sharing  and we never see
most of the stuff again ’
‘oh come ’ said pippin yawning  ‘this is all too tiresome for me
tonight  we’ve got food in our bags  just give us a room to lie down in 
it’ll be better than many places i have seen ’
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease  evidently some rule or
other was being broken  but there was no gainsaying four such masterful
travellers  all armed  and two of them uncommonly large and strong-looking 
frodo ordered the gates to be locked again  there was some sense at any rate in
keeping a guard  while ruffians were still about  then the four companions went
into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as comfortable as they could  it
was a bare and ugly place  with a mean little grate that would not allow a good
fire  in the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds  and on every wall there
was a notice and a list of rules  pippin tore them down  there was no beer and
very little food  but with what the travellers brought and shared out they all
made a fair meal  and pippin broke rule 4 by putting most of next day’s
allowance of wood on the fire 
‘well now  what about a smoke  while you tell us what has been happening in
the shire ’ he said 
‘there isn’t no pipe-weed now ’ said hob  ‘at least only for the
chief’s men  all the stocks seem to have gone  we do hear that waggon-loads of
it went away down the old road out of the southfarthing  over sarn ford way 
that would be the end o’ last year  after you left  but it had been going away
quietly before that  in a small way  that lotho-‘
‘now you shut up  hob hayward ’ cried several of the others  ‘you know
talk o’ that sort isn’t allowed  the chief will hear of it  and we’ll all
be in trouble ’
‘he wouldn’t hear naught  if some of you here weren’t sneaks ’
rejoined hob hotly 
‘all right  all right ’ said sam  “that’s quite enough  i don’t
want to hear no more  no welcome  no beer  no smoke  and a lot of rules and
orc-talk instead  i hoped to have a rest  but i can see there’s work and
trouble ahead  let’s sleep and forget it till morning ’
the new ‘chief’ evidently had means of getting news  it was a good forty
miles from the bridge to bag end  but someone made the journey in a hurry  so
frodo and his friends soon discovered 
they had not made any definite plans  but had vaguely thought of going down
to crickhollow together first  and resting there a bit  but now  seeing what
things were like  they decided to go straight to hobbiton  so the next day they
set out along the road and jogged along steadily  the wind had dropped but the
sky was grey  the land looked rather sad and forlorn  but it was after all the
first of november and the fag-end of autumn  still there seemed an unusual
amount of burning going on  and smoke rose from many points round about  a great
cloud of it was going up far away in the direction of the woody end 
as evening fell they were drawing near to frogmorton  a village right on the
road  about twenty-two miles from the bridge  there they meant to stay the
night  the floating log at frogmorton was a good inn  but as they came to
the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board saying no
road  and behind it stood a large band of shirriffs with staves in their hands
and feathers in their caps  looking both important and rather scared 
‘what’s all this ’ said frodo  feeling inclined to laugh 
this is what it is  mr  baggins  said the leader of the shirriffs  a
two-feather hobbit  ‘you’re arrested for gate-breaking  and tearing up of
rules  and assaulting gate-keepers  and trespassing  and sleeping in
shire-buildings without leave  and bribing guards with food ’
‘and what else ’ said frodo 
‘that’ll do to go on with ’ said the shirriff-leader 
‘i can add some more  if you like it ’ said sam  ‘calling your chief
names  wishing to punch his pimply face  and thinking you shirriffs look a lot
of tom-fools ’
‘there now  mister  that’ll do  it’s the chief’s orders that you’re
to come along quiet  we’re going to take you to bywater and hand you over to
the chief’s men  and when he deals with your case you can have your say  but
if you don’t want to stay in the lockholes any longer than you need  i should
cut the say short  if i was you ’
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his companions all roared with
laughter  ‘don’t be absurd ’ said frodo  ‘i am going where i please  and
in my own time  i happen to be going to bag end on business  but if you insist
on going too  well that is your affair ’
‘very well  mr  baggins ’ said the leader  pushing the barrier aside 
‘but don’t forget i’ve arrested you ’
‘i won’t ’ said frodo  ‘never  but i may forgive you  now i am not
going any further today  so if you’ll kindly escort me to the floating log 
i’ll be obliged ’
‘i can’t do that  mr  baggins  the inn’s closed  there’s a
shirriff-house at the far end of the village  i’ll take you there  ‘
‘all right ’ said frodo  ‘go on and we’ll follow ’
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that he
knew  ‘hey  come here robin smallburrow ’ he called  ‘i want a word with
you ’
with a sheepish glance at his leader  who looked wrathful but did not dare to
interfere  shirriff smallburrow fell back and walked beside sam  who got down
off his pony 
‘look here  cock-robin ’ said sam  ‘you’re hobbiton-bred and ought to
have more sense  coming a-waylaying mr  frodo and all  and what’s all this
about the inn being closed ’
‘they’re all closed ’ said robin  ‘the chief doesn’t hold with
beer  leastways that is how it started  but now i reckon it’s his men that has
it all  and he doesn’t hold with folk moving about  so if they will or they
must  then they has to go to the shirriff-house and explain their business ’
‘you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such
nonsense ’ said sam  ‘you used to like the inside of an inn better than the
outside yourself  you were always popping in  on duty or off ’
‘and so i would be still  sam  if i could  but don’t be hard on me  what
can i do  you know how i went for a shirriff seven years ago  before any of this
began  gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing folk  and
hearing the news  and knowing where the good beer was  but now it’s
different ’
‘but you can give it up  stop shirriffing  if it has stopped being a
respectable job ’ said sam 
‘we’re not allowed to ’ said robin 
‘if i hear not allowed much oftener ’ said sam  ‘i’m going to
get angry ’
‘can’t say as i’d be sorry to see it ’ said robin lowering his voice 
‘if we all got angry together something might be done  but it’s these men 
sam  the chief’s men  he sends them round everywhere  and if any of us small
folk stand up for our rights  they drag him off to the lockholes  they took old
flourdumpling  old will whitfoot the mayor  first  and they’ve taken a lot
more  lately it’s been getting worse  often they beat ‘em now ’
‘then why do you do their work far them ’ said sam angrily  ‘who sent
you to frogmorton ’
‘no one did  we stay here in the big shirriff-house  we’re the first
eastfarthing troop now  there’s hundreds of shirriffs all told and they want
more  with all these new rules  most of them are in it against their will  but
not all  even in the shire there are some as like minding other folk’s
business and talking big  and there’s worse than that  there’s a few as do
spy-work for the chief and his men ’
‘ah  so that’s how you had news of us  is it ’
‘that’s right  we aren’t allowed to send by it now  but they use the
old quick post service  and keep special runners at different points  one came
in from whitfurrows last night with a “secret message”  and another took it
on from here  and a message came back this afternoon saying you was to be
arrested and taken to bywater  not direct to the lockholes  the chief wants to
see you at once  evidently ’
‘he won’t be so eager when mr  frodo has finished with him ’ said sam 
the shirriff-house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge-house  it had only
one storey  but it had the same narrow windows  and it was built of ugly pale
bricks  badly laid  inside it was damp and cheerless  and supper was served on a
long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks  the food deserved no
better setting  the travellers were glad to leave the place  it was about
eighteen miles to bywater  and they set off at ten o’clock in the morning 
they would have started earlier  only the delay so plainly annoyed the
shirriff-leader  the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder 
but the rain was gone 
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village  though the few folk
that came out to stare at the ‘get-up’ of the travellers did not seem quite
sure whether laughing was allowed  a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort
to the ‘prisoners’  but merry made them march in front  while frodo and his
friends rode behind  merry  pippin  and sam sat at their ease laughing and
talking and singing  while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and
important  frodo  however  was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful 
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge 
‘hullo  hullo ’ he jeered  ‘now who’s arrested who ’
two of the shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him 
‘leader ’ said merry  ‘order your fellows back to their places at once  if
you don’t want me to deal with them ’
the two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily  ‘now get
on ’ said merry  and after that the travellers saw to it that their ponies’
pace was quick enough to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go  the
sun came out  and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon puffing and
sweating 
at the three-farthing stone they gave it up  they had done nearly fourteen
miles with only one rest at noon  it was now three o’clock  they were hungry
and very footsore and they could not stand the pace 
‘well  come along in your own time ’ said merry  ‘we are going on ’
‘good-bye  cock-robin ’ said sam  ‘i’ll wait for you outside the
green dragon  if you haven’t forgotten where that is  don’t dawdle on
the way ’
‘you’re breaking arrest  that’s what you’re doing ’ said the leader
ruefully  ‘and i can’t be answerable ’
‘we shall break a good many things yet  and not ask you to answer ‘ said
pippin  ‘good luck to you ’
the travellers trotted on  and as the sun began to sink towards the white
downs far away on the western horizon they came to bywater by its wide pool  and
there they had their first really painful shock  this was frodo and sam’s own
country  and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other
place in the world  many of the houses that they had known were missing  some
seemed to have been burned down  the pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the
bank on the north side of the pool were deserted  and their little gardens that
used to run down bright to the water’s edge were rank with weeds  worse  there
was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along pool side  where the hobbiton
road ran close to the bank  an avenue of trees had stood there  they were all
gone  and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end they saw a tall
chimney of brick in the distance  it was pouring out black smoke into the
evening air 
sam was beside himself  ‘i’m going right on  mr  frodo ’ he cried 
‘i’m going to see what’s up  i want to find my gaffer ’
‘we ought to find out first what we’re in for  sam ’ said merry  ‘i
guess that the “chief” will have a gang of ruffians handy  we had better
find someone who will tell us how things are round here ’
but in the village of bywater all the houses and holes were shut  and no one
greeted them  they wondered at this  but they soon discovered the reason of it 
when they reached the green dragon  the last house on the hobbiton side 
now lifeless and with broken windows  they were disturbed to see half a dozen
large ill-favoured men lounging against the inn-wall  they were squint-eyed and
sallow-faced 
‘like that friend of bill ferny’s at bree ’ said sam 
‘like many that i saw at isengard ’ muttered merry 
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts  but they had
no other weapons  as far as could be seen  as the travellers rode up they left
the wall and walked into the road  blocking the way 
‘where d’you think you’re going ’ said one  the largest and most
evil-looking of the crew  ‘there’s no road for you any further  and where
are those precious shirriffs ’
‘coming along nicely ’ said merry  ‘a little footsore  perhaps  we
promised to wait for them here ’
‘garn  what did i say ’ said the ruffian to his mates  ‘i told sharkey
it was no good trusting those little fools  some of our chaps ought to have been
sent ’
‘and what difference would that have made  pray ’ said merry  ‘we are
not used to footpads in this country  but we know how to deal with them ’
‘footpads  eh ’ said the man  ‘so that’s your tone  is it  change it 
or we’ll change it for you  you little folk are getting too uppish  don’t
you trust too much in the boss’s kind heart  sharkey’s come now and he’ll
do what sharkey says ’
‘and what may that be ’ said frodo quietly 
‘this country wants waking up and setting to rights ’ said the ruffian 
‘and sharkey’s going to do it  and make it hard  if you drive him to it  you
need a bigger boss  and you’ll get one before the year is out  if there’s
any more trouble  then you’ll learn a thing or two  you little rat-folk ’
‘indeed  i am glad to hear of your plans ’ said frodo  ‘i am on my way
to call on mr  lotho  and he may be interested to hear of them too ’
the ruffian laughed  ‘lotho  he knows all right  don’t you worry  he’ll
do what sharkey says  because if a boss gives trouble  we can change him  see 
and if little folks try to push in where they’re not wanted  we can put them
out of mischief  see ’
‘yes  i see ’ said frodo  ‘for one thing  i see that you’re behind
the times and the news here  much has happened since you left the south  your
day is over  and all other ruffians’  the dark tower has fallen  and there is
a king in gondor  and isengard has been destroyed  and your precious master is a
beggar in the wilderness  i passed him on the road  the king’s messengers will
ride up the greenway now not bullies from isengard ’
the man stared at him and smiled  ‘a beggar in the wilderness ’ he
mocked  ‘oh  is he indeed  swagger it  swagger it  my little cock-a-whoop  but
that won’t stop us living in this fat little country where you have lazed long
enough  and’ - he snapped his fingers in frodo’s face - ‘king’s
messengers  that for them  when i see one  i’ll take notice  perhaps ’
this was too much for pippin  his thoughts went back to the field of
cormallen  and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the ring-bearer ‘little
cock-a-whoop’  he cast back his cloak  flashed out his sword  and the silver
and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward 
‘i am a messenger of the king ’ he said  ‘you are speaking to the
king’s friend  and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the west  you
are a ruffian and a fool  down on your knees in the road and ask pardon  or i
will set this troll’s bane in you ’
the sword glinted in the westering sun  merry and sam drew their swords also
and rode up to support pippin  but frodo did not move  the ruffians gave back 
scaring breeland peasants  and bullying bewildered hobbits  had been their work 
fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise  and
there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard
before  it chilled them with fear 
‘go ’ said merry  ‘if you trouble this village again  you will regret
it ’ the three hobbits came on  and then the ruffians turned and fled running
away up the hobbiton road  but they blew their horns as they ran 
‘well  we’ve come back none too soon ’ said merry 
‘not a day too soon  perhaps too late  at any rate to save lotho ’ said
frodo  ‘miserable fool  but i am sorry for him ’
‘save lotho  whatever do you mean ’ said pippin  ‘destroy him i should
say ’
‘i don’t think you quite understand things  pippin ’ said frodo 
‘lotho never meant things to come to this pass  he has been a wicked fool  but
he’s caught now  the ruffians are on top  gathering  robbing and bullying  and
running or ruining things as they like  in his name  and not in his name even
for much longer  he’s a prisoner in bag end now  i expect  and very
frightened  we ought to try and rescue him ’
‘well i am staggered ’ said pippin  ‘of all the ends to our journey
that is the very last i should have thought of  to have to fight half-orcs and
ruffians in the shire itself - to rescue lotho pimple ’
‘fight ’ said frodo  ‘well  i suppose it may come to that  but
remember  there is to be no slaying of hobbits  not even if they have gone over
to the other side  really gone over  i mean  not just obeying ruffians’ orders
because they are frightened  no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the
shire  and it is not to begin now  and nobody is to be killed at all  if it can
be helped  keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment ’
‘but if there are many of these ruffians ’ said merry  ‘it will
certainly mean fighting  you won’t rescue lotho  or the shire  just by being
shocked and sad  my dear frodo ’
‘no ’ said pippin  ‘it won’t be so easy scaring them a second time 
they were taken by surprise  you heard that horn-blowing  evidently there are
other ruffians near at hand  they’ll be much bolder when there’s more of
them together  we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night  after
all we’re only four  even if we are armed ’
‘i’ve an idea ’ said sam  ‘let’s go to old tom cotton’s down
south lane  he always was a stout fellow  and he has a lot of lads that were all
friends of mine ’
‘no ’ said merry  ‘it’s no good “getting under cover”  that is
just what people have been doing  and just what these ruffians like  they will
simply come down on us in force  corner us  and then drive us out  or burn us
in  no  we have got to do something at once ’
‘do what ’ said pippin 
‘raise the shire ’ said merry  ‘now  wake all our people  they hate all
this  you can see  all of them except perhaps one or two rascals  and a few
fools that want to be important  but don’t at all understand what is really
going on  but shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don’t know what
to do  they just want a match  though  and they’ll go up in fire  the
chief’s men must know that  they’ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick 
we’ve only got a very short time 
‘sam  you can make a dash for cotton’s farm  if you like  he’s the
chief person round here  and the sturdiest  come on  i am going to blow the horn
of rohan  and give them all some music they have never heard before ’
they rode back to the middle of the village  there sam turned aside and
galloped off down the lane that led south to cotton’s  he had not gone far
when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky  far over hill
and field it echoed  and so compelling was that call that sam himself almost
turned and dashed back  his pony reared and neighed 
‘on  lad  on ’ he cried  ‘we’ll be going back soon ’
then he heard merry change the note  and up went the horn-cry of buckland 
shaking the air 
awake  awake  fear  fire  foes  awake 

fire  foes  awake 
behind him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of
doors  in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming  dogs barked  feet came
running  before he got to the lane’s end there was farmer cotton with three of
his lads  young tom  jolly  and nick  hurrying towards him  they had axes in
their hands  and barred the way 
‘nay  it’s not one of them ruffians ’ sam heard the farmer say 
‘it’s a hobbit by the size of it  but all dressed up queer  hey ’ he
cried  ‘who are you  and what’s all this to-do ’
‘it’s sam  sam gamgee  i’ve come back ’
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight  ‘well ’ he
exclaimed  ‘the voice is right  and your face is no worse than it was  sam 
but i should a’ passed you in the street in that gear  you’ve been in
foreign parts  seemingly  we feared you were dead ’
‘that i ain’t ’ said sam  ‘nor mr  frodo  he’s here and his
friends  and that’s the to-do  they’re raising the shire  we’re going to
clear out these ruffians  and their chief too  we’re starting now ’
‘good  good ’ cried farmer cotton  ‘so it’s begun at last  i’ve
been itching for trouble all this year  but folks wouldn’t help  and i’ve
had the wife and rosie to think of  these ruffians don’t stick at nothing  but
come on now  lads  bywater is up  we must be in it ’
‘what about mrs  cotton and rosie ’ said sam  ‘it isn’t safe yet for
them to be left all alone ’
‘my nibs is with them  but you can go and help him  if you have a mind ’
said farmer cotton with a grin  then he and his sons ran off towards the
village 
sam hurried to the house  by the large round door at the top of the steps
from the wide yard stood mrs  cotton and rosie  and nibs in front of them
grasping a hay-fork 
‘it’s me ’ shouted sam as he trotted up  ‘sam gamgee  so don’t try
prodding me  nibs  anyway  i’ve a mail-shirt on me ’
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps  they stared at him in
silence  ‘good evening  mrs  cotton ’ he said  ‘hullo rosie ’
‘hullo  sam ’ said rosie  ‘where’ve you been i they said you were
dead  but i’ve been expecting you since the spring  you haven’t hurried have
you ’
‘perhaps not ’ said sam abashed  ‘but i’m hurrying now  we’re
setting about the ruffians  and i’ve got to get back to mr  frodo  but i
thought i’d have a look and see how mrs  cotton was keeping  and you 
rosie ’
‘we’re keeping nicely  thank you ’ said mrs  cotton  ‘or should be 
if it weren’t for these thieving ruffians ’
‘well  be off with you ’ said rosie  ‘if you’ve been looking after
mr  frodo all this while  what d’you want to leave him for  as soon as things
look dangerous ’
this was too much for sam  it needed a week’s answer  or none  he turned
away and mounted his pony  but as he started off  rosie ran down the steps 
‘i think you look fine  sam ’ she said  ‘go on now  but take care of
yourself  and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians ’
when sam got back he found the whole village roused  already  apart from many
younger lads  more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes  and
heavy hammers  and long knives  and stout staves  and a few had hunting-bows 
more were still coming in from outlying farms 
some of the village-folk had lit a large fire  just to enliven things  and
also because it was one of the things forbidden by the chief  it burned bright
as night came on  others at merry’s orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village  when the shirriffs came up to the lower one
they were dumbfounded  but as soon as they saw how things were  most of them
took off their feathers and joined in the revolt  the others slunk away 
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old tom cotton  while
an admiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared 
‘well  what’s the next move ’ said farmer cotton 
‘i can’t say ’ said frodo  ‘until i know more  how many of these
ruffians are there ’
‘that’s hard to tell ’ said cotton  ‘they moves about and comes and
goes  there’s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton way  but they
go out from there roving round  thieving or “gathering” as they call it 
still there’s seldom less than a score round the boss  as they names him 
he’s at bag end  or was  but he don’t go outside the rounds now  no one s
seen him at all  in fact  for a week or two  but the men don’t let no one go
near ’
‘hobbiton’s not their only place  is it ’ said pippin 
‘no  more’s the pity ’ said cotton  ‘there’s a good few down south
in longbottom and by sarn ford  i hear  and some more lurking in the woody end 
and they’ve sheds at waymeet  and then there’s the lockholes  as they call
‘em  the old storage-tunnels at michel delving that they’ve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them  still i reckon there’s not above three
hundred of them in the shire all told  and maybe less  we can master them  if we
stick together ’
‘have they got any weapons ’ asked merry 
‘whips  knives  and clubs  enough for their dirty work  that’s all
they’ve showed so far ’ said cotton  ‘but i dare say they’ve got other
gear  if it comes to fighting  some have bows  anyway  they’ve shot one or two
of our folk ’
‘there you are  frodo ’ said merry  ‘i knew we should have to fight 
well  they started the killing ’
‘not exactly ’ said cotton  ‘leastways not the shooting  tooks started
that  you see our dad mr  peregrin  he’s never had no truck with this lotho 
not from the beginning  said that if anyone was going to play the chief at this
time of day  it would be the right thain of the shire and no upstart  and when
lotho sent his men they got no change out of him  tooks are lucky  they’ve got
those deep holes in the green hills  the great smials and all  and the ruffians
can’t come at ‘em  and they won’t let the ruffians come on their land  if
they do  tooks hunt ‘em  tooks shot three for prowling and robbing  after that
the ruffians turned nastier  and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland  no
one gets in nor out of it now ’
‘good for the tooks ’ cried pippin  ‘but someone is going to get in
again  now  i am off to the smials  anyone coming with me to tuckborough ’
pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies  ‘see you soon ’ he
cried  ‘it’s only fourteen miles or so over the fields  i’ll bring you
back an army of tooks in the morning ’ merry blew a horn-call after them as
they rode off into the gathering night  the people cheered 
‘all the same ’ said frodo to all those who stood near  ‘i wish for no
killing  not even of the ruffians  unless it must be done  to prevent them from
hurting hobbits ’
‘all right ’ said merry  ‘but we shall be having a visit from the
hobbiton gang any time now  i think  they won’t come just to talk things over 
we’ll try to deal with them neatly  but we must be prepared for the worst  now
i’ve got a plan ’
‘very good ’ said frodo  ‘you make the arrangements ’
just then some hobbits  who had been sent out towards hobbiton  came running
in  ‘they’re coming ’ they said  ‘a score or more  but two have gone off
west across country ’
‘to waymeet  that’ll be ’ said cotton  ‘to fetch more of the gang 
well  it’s fifteen mile each way  we needn’t trouble about them just yet ’
merry hurried off to give orders  farmer cotton cleared the street  sending
everyone indoors  except the older hobbits who had weapons of some sort  they
had not long to wait  soon they could hear loud voices  and then the tramping of
heavy feet  presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road  they saw
the barrier and laughed  they did not imagine that there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twenty of their kind together 
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside  ‘thank you ’ the men
jeered  ‘now run home to bed before you’re whipped ’ then they marched
along the street shouting  ‘put those lights out  get indoors and stay there 
or we’ll take fifty of you to the lockholes for a year  get in  the boss is
losing his temper ’
no one paid any heed to their orders  but as the ruffians passed  they closed
in quietly behind and followed them  when the men reached the fire there was
farmer cotton standing all alone warming his hands 
‘who are you  and what d’you think you’re doing ’ said the
ruffian-leader 
farmer cotton looked at him slowly  ‘i was just going to ask you that ’
he said  ‘this isn’t your country  and you’re not wanted ’
‘well  you’re wanted anyhow ’ said the leader  ‘we want you  take him
lads  lockholes for him  and give him something to keep him quiet ’
the men took one step forward and stopped short  there rose a roar of voices
all round them  and suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all
alone  they were surrounded  in the dark on the edge of the firelight stood a
ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows  there was nearly two
hundred of them  all holding some weapon 
merry stepped forward  ‘we have met before ’ he said to the leader 
‘and i warned you not to come back here  i warn you again  you are standing in
the light and you are covered by archers  if you lay a finger on this farmer  or
on anyone else  you will be shot at once  lay down any weapons that you have ’
the leader looked round  he was trapped  but he was not scared  not now with
a score of his fellows to back him  he knew too little of hobbits to understand
his peril  foolishly he decided to fight  it would be easy to break out 
‘at ‘em lads ’ he cried  ‘let ‘em have it ’
with a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a rush at
the ring  trying to burst out back towards hobbiton  he aimed a savage blow at
merry who stood in his way  he fell dead with four arrows in him 
that was enough for the others  they gave in  their weapons were taken from
them  and they were roped together  and marched off to an empty hut that they
had built themselves  and there they were tied hand and foot  and locked up
under guard  the dead leader was dragged off and buried 
‘seems almost too easy after all  don’t it ’ said cotton  ‘i said we
could master them  but we needed a call  you came back in the nick o’ time 
mr  merry ’
‘there’s more to be done still ’ said merry  ‘if you’re right in
your reckoning  we haven’t dealt with a tithe of them yet  but it’s dark
now  i think the next stroke must wait until morning  then we must call on the
chief ’
‘why not now ’ said sam  ‘it’s not much more than six o’clock  and
i want to see my gaffer  d’you know what’s come of him  mr  cotton ’
‘he’s not too well  and not too bad  sam ’ said the farmer  ‘they dug
up bagshot row  and that was a sad blow to him  he’s in one of them new houses
that the chief’s men used to build while they still did any work other than
burning and thieving  not above a mile from the end of bywater  but he comes
around to me  when he gets a chance  and i see he’s better fed than some of
the poor bodies  all against the rules  of course  i’d have had him
with me  but that wasn’t allowed ’
‘thank’ee indeed  mr  cotton  and i’ll never forget it ’ said sam 
‘but i want to see him  that boss and that sharkey  as they spoke of  they
might do a mischief up there before the morning ’
‘all right  sam ’ said cotton  ‘choose a lad or two  and go and fetch
him to my house  you’ll not have need to go near the old hobbiton village over
water  my jolly here will show you ’
sam went off  merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards at
the barriers during the night  then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton 
they sat with the family in the warm kitchen  and the cottons asked a few polite
questions about their travels  but hardly listened to the answers  they were far
more concerned with events in the shire 
‘it all began with pimple  as we call him ’ said farmer cotton  ‘and it
began as soon as you’d gone off  mr  frodo  he’d funny ideas had pimple 
seems he wanted to own everything himself  and then order other folk about  it
soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him  and he
was always grabbing more  though where he got the money was a mystery  mills and
malt-houses and inns  and farms  and leaf-plantations  he’d already bought
sandyman’s mill before he came to bag end  seemingly 
‘of course he started with a lot of property in the southfarthing which he
had from his dad  and it seems he’d been selling a lot o’ the best leaf  and
sending it away quietly for a year or two  but at the end o’ last year he
began sending away loads of stuff  not only leaf  things began to get short  and
winter coming on  too  folk got angry  but he had his answer  a lot of men 
ruffians mostly  came with great waggons  some to carry off the goods
south-away  and others to stay  and more came  and before we knew where we were
they were planted here and there all over the shire  and were felling trees and
digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked  at first
goods and damage was paid for by pimple  but soon they began lording it around
and taking what they wanted 
‘then there was a bit of trouble  but not enough  old will the mayor set
off for bag end to protest  but he never got there  ruffians laid hands on him
and took and locked him up in a hole in michel delving  and there he is now  and
after that  it would be soon after new year  there wasn’t no more mayor  and
pimple called himself chief shirriff  or just chief  and did as he liked  and if
anyone got “uppish” as they called it  they followed will  so things went
from bad to worse  there wasn’t no smoke left  save for the men  and the chief
didn’t hold with beer  save for his men  and closed all the inns  and
everything except rules got shorter and shorter  unless one could hide a bit of
one’s own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up “for fair
distribution”  which meant they got it and we didn’t  except for the
leavings which you could have at the shirriff-houses  if you could stomach them 
all very bad  but since sharkey came it’s been plain ruination ’
‘who is this sharkey ’ said merry  ‘i heard one of the ruffians speak
of him ’
‘the biggest ruffian o’ the lot  seemingly ’ answered cotton  ‘it was
about last harvest  end o’ september maybe  that we first heard of him 
we’ve never seen him  but he’s up at bag end  and he’s the real chief now 
i guess  all the ruffians do what he says  and what he says is mostly hack 
burn  and ruin  and now it s come to killing  there s no longer even any bad
sense in it  they cut down trees and let ‘em lie  they burn houses and build
no more 
‘take sandyman’s mill now  pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he
came to bag end  then he brought in a lot o’ dirty-looking men to build a
bigger one and fill it full o’ wheels and outlandish contraptions  only that
fool ted was pleased by that  and he works there cleaning wheels for the men 
where his dad was the miller and his own master  pimple’s idea was to grind
more and faster  or so he said  he’s got other mills like it  but you’ve got
to have grist before you can grind  and there was no more for the new mill to do
than for the old  but since sharkey came they don’t grind no more corn at all 
they’re always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a stench  and there
isn’t no peace even at night in hobbiton  and they pour out filth a purpose 
they’ve fouled all the lower water and it’s getting down into brandywine  if
they want to make the shire into a desert  they’re going the right way about
it  i don’t believe that fool of a pimple’s behind all this  it’s sharkey 
i say ’
‘that’s right ’ put in young tom  ‘why  they even took pimple’s old
ma  that lobelia  and he was fond of her  if no one else was  some of the
hobbiton folk  they saw it  she comes down the lane with her old umbrella  some
of the ruffians were going up with a big cart 
‘ “where be you a-going ” says she 
‘ “to bag end ” says they 
‘ “what for ” says she 
‘ “to put up some sheds for sharkey ” says they 
‘ “who said you could ” says she 
‘ “sharkey ” says they  “so get out o’ the road  old hagling ”
‘ “i’ll give you sharkey  you dirty thieving ruffians ” says she  and
ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader  near twice her size  so they took
her  dragged her off to the lockholes  at her age too  they’ve took others we
miss more  but there’s no denying she showed more spirit than most ’
into the middle of this talk came sam  bursting in with his gaffer  old
gamgee did not look much older  but he was a little deafer 
‘good evening  mr  baggins ’ he said  ‘glad indeed i am to see you safe
back  but i’ve a bone to pick with you  in a manner o’ speaking  if i may
make so bold  you didn’t never ought to have a’ sold bag end  as i always
said  that’s what started all the mischief  and while you’re been trapessing
in foreign parts  chasing black men up mountains from what my sam says  though
what for he don’t make clear  they’ve been and dug up bagshot row and ruined
my taters ’
‘i am very sorry  mr  gamgee ’ said frodo  ‘but now i’ve come back 
i’ll do my best to make amends ’
‘well  you can’t say fairer than that ’ said the gaffer  ‘mr  frodo
baggins is a real gentlehobbit  i always have said  whatever you may think of
some others of the name  begging your pardon  and i hope my sam’s behaved
hisself and given satisfaction ’
‘perfect satisfaction  mr  gamgee ’ said frodo  ‘indeed  if you will
believe it  he’s now one of the most famous people in all the lands  and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the sea and beyond the great
river ’ sam blushed  but he looked gratefully at frodo  for rosie’s eyes
were shining and she was smiling at him 
‘it takes a lot o’ believing ’ said the gaffer  ‘though i can see
he’s been mixing in strange company  what’s come of his weskit  i don’t
hold with wearing ironmongery  whether it wears well or no ’
farmer cotton’s household and all his guests were up early next morning 
nothing had been heard in the night  but more trouble would certainly come
before the day was old  ‘seems as if none o’ the ruffians were left up at
bag end ’ said cotton  ‘but the gang from waymeet will be along any time
now ’
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in  he was in high
spirits  ‘the thain has raised all our country ’ he said  ‘and the news is
going like fire all ways  the ruffians that were watching our land have fled off
south  those that escaped alive  the thain has gone after them  to hold off the
big gang down that way  but he’s sent mr peregrin back with all the other folk
he can spare ’
the next news was less good  merry  who had been out all night  came riding
in about ten o’clock  ‘there’s a big band about four miles away ’ he
said  ‘they’re coming along the road from waymeet  but a good many stray
ruffians have joined up with them  there must be close on a hundred of them  and
they’re fire-raising as they come  curse them ’
‘ah  this lot won’t stay to talk  they’ll kill  if they can ’ said
farmer cotton  ‘if tooks don’t come sooner  we’d best get behind cover and
shoot without arguing  there’s got to be some fighting before this is settled 
mr  frodo ’
the tooks did come sooner  before long they marched in  a hundred strong 
from tuckborough and the green hills with pippin at their head  merry now had
enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians  scouts reported that they were
keeping close together  they knew that the countryside had risen against them 
and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly  at its centre in
bywater  but however grim they  might be  they seemed to have no leader among
them who understood warfare  they came on without any precautions  merry laid
his plans quickly 
the ruffians came tramping along the east road  and without halting turned up
the bywater road  which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low
hedges on top  round a bend  about a furlong from the main road  they met a
stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned  that halted them  at the same moment
they became aware that the hedges on both sides  just above their heads  were
all lined with hobbits  behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more
waggons that had been hidden in a field  and so blocked the way back  a voice
spoke to them from above 
‘well  you have walked into a trap ’ said merry  ‘your fellows from
hobbiton did the same  and one is dead and the rest are prisoners  lay down your
weapons  then go back twenty paces and sit down  any who try to break out will
be shot ’
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily  a few of them obeyed  but
were immediately set on by their fellows  a score or more broke back and charged
the waggons  six were shot  but the remainder burst out  killing two hobbits 
and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end  two more
fell as they ran  merry blew a loud horn-call  and there were answering calls
from a distance 
‘they won’t get far ’ said pippin  ‘all that country is alive with
our hunters now ’
behind  the trapped men in the lane  still about four score  tried to climb
the barrier and the banks  and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or
hew them with axes  but many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the
west side  and attacked their enemies fiercely  being now more bent on killing
than escaping  several hobbits fell  and the rest were wavering  when merry and
pippin  who were on the east side  came across and charged the ruffians  merry
himself slew the leader  a great squint-eyed brute like a huge orc  then he drew
his forces off  encircling the last remnant of the men in a wide ring of
archers 
at last all was over  nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field 
and a dozen were prisoners  nineteen hobbits were killed  and some thirty were
wounded  the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off to an old
sand-pit nearby and there buried  in the battle pit  as it was afterwards
called  the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the hill-side  where
later a great stone was set up with a garden about it  so ended the battle of
bywater  1419  the last battle fought in the shire  and the only battle since
the greenfields  1147  away up in the northfarthing  in consequence  though it
happily cost very few lives  it has a chapter to itself in the red book  and the
names of all those who took part were made into a roll  and learned by heart by
shire-historians  the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the
cottons dates from this time  but at the top of the roll in all accounts stand
the names of captains meriadoc and peregrin 
frodo had been in the battle  but he had not drawn sword  and his chief part
had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses  from slaying
those of their enemies who threw down their weapons  when the fighting was over 
and the later labours were ordered  merry  pippin  and sam joined him  and they
rode back with the cottons  they ate a late midday meal  and then frodo said
with a sigh  ‘well  i suppose it is time now that we dealt with the
“chief” ’
‘yes indeed  the sooner the better ’ said merry  ‘and don’t be too
gentle  he’s responsible for bringing in these ruffians  and for all the evil
they have done ’
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits  ‘for
it’s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at bag end ’ he said  ‘we
don’t know ’ then they set out on foot  frodo  sam  merry  and pippin led
the way 
it was one of the saddest hours in their lives  the great chimney rose up
before them  and as they drew near the old village across the water  through
rows of new mean houses along each side of the road  they saw the new mill in
all its frowning and dirty ugliness  a great brick building straddling the
stream  which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow  all along the
bywater road every tree had been felled 
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped  even sam’s
vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw  the old grange on
the west side had been knocked down  and its place taken by rows of tarred
sheds  all the chestnuts were gone  the banks and hedgerows were broken  great
waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass  bagshot row
was a yawning sand and gravel quarry  bag end up  beyond could not be seen for a
clutter of large huts 
‘they’ve cut it down ’ cried sam  ‘they’ve cut down the party
tree ’ he pointed to where the tree  had stood under which bilbo had made his
farewell speech  it was lying lopped and dead in the field  as if this was the
last straw sam burst into tears 
a laugh put an end to them  there was a surly hobbit lounging over the low
wall of the mill-yard  he was grimy-faced and black-handed  ‘don’t ‘ee
like it  sam ’ he sneered  ‘but you always was soft  i thought you’d gone
off in one o’ them ships you used to prattle about  sailing  sailing  what
d’you want to come back for  we’ve work to do in the shire now ’
‘so i see ’ said sam  ‘no time for washing  but time for wall-propping 
but see here  master sandyman  i’ve a score to pay in this village  and
don’t you make it any longer with your jeering  or you’ll foot a bill too
big for your purse ’
ted sandyman spat over the wall  ‘garn ’ he said  ‘you can’t touch
me  i’m a friend o’ the boss’s  but he’ll touch you all right  if i have
any more of your mouth ’
‘don’t waste any more words on the fool  sam ’ said frodo  ‘i hope
there are not many more hobbits that have become like this  it would be a worse
trouble than all the damage the men have done ’
‘you are dirty and insolent  sandyman ’ said merry  ‘and also very much
out of your reckoning  we are just going up the hill to remove your precious
boss  we have dealt with his men ’
ted gaped  for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that at a
sign from merry now marched over the bridge  dashing back into the mill he ran
out with a horn and blew it loudly 
‘save your breath ’ laughed merry  ‘i’ve a better ’ then lifting up
his silver horn he winded it  and its clear call rang over the hill  and out of
the holes and sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton the hobbits answered  and came
pouring out  and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company up the
road to bag end 
at the top of the lane the party halted  and frodo and his friends went on 
and they came at last to the once beloved place  the garden was full of huts and
sheds  some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light 
there were piles of refuse everywhere  the door was scarred  the bell-chain was
dangling loose  and the bell would not ring  knocking brought no answer  at
length they pushed and the door yielded  they went in  the place stank and was
full of filth and disorder  it did not appear to have been used for some time 
‘where is that miserable lotho hiding ’ said merry  they had searched
every room and found no living thing save rats and mice  ‘shall we turn on the
others to search the sheds ’
‘this is worse than mordor ’ said sam  ‘much worse in a way  it comes
home to you  as they say  because it is home  and you remember it before it was
all ruined ’
‘yes  this is mordor ’ said frodo  ‘just one of its works  saruman was
doing its work all the time  even when he thought he was working for himself 
and the same with those that saruman tricked  like lotho ’
merry looked round in dismay and disgust  ‘let’s get out ’ he said 
‘if i had known all the mischief he had caused  i should have stuffed my pouch
down saruman’s throat ’
‘no doubt  no doubt  but you did not  and so i am able to welcome you
home ’ there standing at the door was saruman himself  looking well-fed and
well-pleased  his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement 
a sudden light broke on frodo  ‘sharkey ’ he cried 
saruman laughed  ‘so you have heard the name  have you  all my people used
to call me that in isengard  i believe  a sign of affection  possibly «
but evidently you did not expect to see me here ’
‘i did not ’ said frodo  ‘but i might have guessed  a little mischief
in a mean way  gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it 
‘quite capable ’ said saruman  ‘and more than a little  you made me
laugh  you hobbit-lordlings  riding along with all those great people so secure
and so pleased with your little selves  you thought you had done very well out
of it all  and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time in the
country  saruman’s home could be all wrecked  and he could be turned out  but
no one could touch yours  oh no  gandalf would look after your affairs ’
saruman laughed again  ‘not he  when his tools have done their task he
drops them  but you must go dangling after him  dawdling and talking  and riding
round twice as far as you needed  “well ” thought i  “if they’re such
fools  i will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson  one ill turn deserves
another ” it would have been a sharper lesson  if only you had given me a
little more time and more men  still i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives  and it will be pleasant to think of that
and set it against my injuries ’
‘well  if that is what you find pleasure in ’ said frodo  ‘i pity you 
it will be a pleasure of memory only  i fear  go at once and never return ’
the hobbits of the villages had seen saruman come out of one of the huts  and
at once they came crowding up to the door of bag end  when they heard frodo’s
command  they murmured angrily 
‘don’t let him go  kill him  he’s a villain and a murderer  kill
him ’
saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled  ‘kill him ’ he
mocked  ‘kill him  if you think there are enough of you  my brave hobbits ’
he drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes  ‘but do not
think that when i lost all my goods i lost all my power  whoever strikes me
shall be accursed  and if my blood stains the shire  it shall wither and never
again be healed ’
the hobbits recoiled  but frodo said  ‘do not believe him  he has lost all
power  save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you  if you let it 
but i will not have him slain  it is useless to meet revenge with revenge  it
will heal nothing  go  saruman  by the speediest way ’
‘worm  worm ’ saruman called  and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue 
crawling  almost like a dog  to the road again  worm ’ said saruman  ‘these
fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again  come along ’
saruman turned to go  and wormtongue shuffled after him  but even as saruman
passed close to frodo a knife flashed in his hand  and he stabbed swiftly  the
blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped  a dozen hobbits  led by sam 
leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground  sam drew his
sword 
‘no  sam ’ said frodo  ‘do not kill him even now  for he has not hurt
me  and in any case i do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood  he was
great once  of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against 
he is fallen  and his cure is beyond us  but i would still spare him  in the
hope that he may find it ’
saruman rose to his feet  and stared at frodo  there was a strange look in
his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred  ‘you have grown 
halfling ’ he said  ‘yes  you have grown very much  you are wise  and cruel 
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness  and now i must go hence in bitterness 
in debt to your mercy  i hate it and you  well  i go and i will trouble you no
more  but do not expect me to wish you health and long life  you will have
neither  but that is not my doing  i merely foretell ’
he walked away  and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass  but their
knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons  wormtongue hesitated  and
then followed his master 
‘wormtongue ’ called frodo  ‘you need not follow him  i know of no evil
you have done to me  you can have rest and food here for a while  until you are
stronger and can go your own ways ’
wormtongue halted and looked back at him  half prepared to stay  saruman
turned  ‘no evil ’ he cackled  ‘oh no  even when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars  but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding  you know  don’t you  worm  will you tell them ’
wormtongue cowered down and whimpered  ‘no  no ’
‘then i will ’ said saruman  ‘worm killed your chief  poor little
fellow  your nice little boss  didn’t you  worm  stabbed him in his sleep  i
believe  buried him  i hope  though worm has been very hungry lately  no  worm
is not really nice  you had better leave him to me ’
a look of wild hatred came into wormtongue’s red eyes  ‘you told me to 
you made me do it ’ he hissed 
saruman laughed  ‘you do what sharkey says  always  don’t you  worm 
well  now he says  follow ’ he kicked wormtongue in the face as he grovelled 
and turned and made off  but at that something snapped  suddenly wormtongue rose
up  drawing a hidden knife  and then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on
saruman’s back  jerked his head back  cut his throat  and with a yell ran off
down the lane  before frodo could recover or speak a word  three hobbit-bows
twanged and wormtongue fell dead 
to the dismay of those that stood by  about the body of saruman a grey mist
gathered  and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire  as a pale
shrouded figure it loomed over the hill  for a moment it wavered  looking to the
west  but out of the west came a cold wind  and it bent away  and with a sigh
dissolved into nothing 
frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror  for as he looked it
seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it  and it shrank  and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull  lifting up the
skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it  he covered it over  and turned
away 
‘and that’s the end of that ’ said sam  ‘a nasty end  and i wish i
needn’t have seen it  but it’s a good riddance ’
‘and the very last end of the war  i hope ’ said merry 
‘i hope so ’ said frodo and sighed  ‘the very last stroke  but to think
that it should fall here  at the very door of bag end  among all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that ’
‘i shan’t call it the end  till we’ve cleared up the mess ’ said sam
gloomily  ‘and that’ll take a lot of time and work ’
 
the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work  but it took less time than
sam had feared  the day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving and
released the prisoners from the lockholes  one of the first that they found was
poor fredegar bolger  fatty no longer  he had been taken when the ruffians
smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in the
brockenbores by the hills of scary 
‘you would have done better to come with us after all  poor old
fredegar ’ said pippin  as they carried him out too weak to walk 
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile  ‘who’s this young giant
with the loud voice ’ he whispered  ‘not little pippin  what’s your size
in hats now ’
then there was lobelia  poor thing  she looked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow cell  she insisted on hobbling out on her own
feet  and she had such a welcome  and there was such clapping and cheering when
she appeared  leaning on frodo’s arm but still clutching her umbrella  that
she was quite touched  and drove away in tears  she had never in her life been
popular before  but she was crushed by the news of lotho’s murder  and she
would’ not return to bag end  she gave it back to frodo  and went to her own
people  the bracegirdles of hardbottle 
when the poor creature died next spring-she was after all more than a hundred
years old - frodo was surprised and much moved  she had left all that remained
of her money and of lotho’s for him to use in helping hobbits made homeless by
the troubles  so that feud was ended 
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than any  and though he
had perhaps been treated less harshly than some  he needed a lot of feeding up
before he could look the part of mayor  so frodo agreed to act as his deputy 
until mr  whitfoot was in shape again  the only thing that he did as deputy
mayor was to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers  the
task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to merry and
pippin  and it was soon done  the southern gangs  after hearing the news of the
battle of bywater  fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the
thain  before the year’s end the few survivors were rounded up in the woods 
and those that surrendered were shown to the borders 
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace  and sam was kept very busy 
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them  now there
were thousands of willing hands of all ages  from the small but nimble ones of
the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of the gaffers and
gammers  before yule not a brick was left standing of the new shirriff-houses or
of anything that had been built by ‘sharkey’s men’  but the bricks were
used to repair many an old hole  to make it snugger and drier  great stores of
goods and food  and beer  were found that had been hidden away by the ruffians
in sheds and barns and deserted holes  and especially in the tunnels at michel
delving and in the old quarries at scary  so that there was a great deal better
cheer that yule than anyone had hoped for 
one of the first things done in hobbiton  before even the removal of the new
mill  was the clearing of the hill and bag end  and the restoration of bagshot
row  the front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into a large
sheltered garden  and new holes were dug in the southward face  back into the
hill  and they were lined with brick  the gaffer was restored to number three 
and he said often and did not care who heard it 
‘it’s an ill wind as blows nobody no good  as i always say  and all’s
well as ends better ’
there was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given  battle
gardens was thought of  or better smials  but after a while in
sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called new row  it was a purely
bywater joke to refer to it as sharkey’s end 
the trees were the worst loss and damage  for at sharkey’s bidding they had
been cut down recklessly far and wide over the shire  and sam grieved over this
more than anything else  for one thing  this hurt would take long to heal  and
only his great-grandchildren  he thought  would see the shire as it ought to be 
then suddenly one day  for he had been too busy for weeks to give a thought
to his adventures  he remembered the gift of galadriel  he brought the box out
and showed it to the other travellers  for so they were now called by everyone  
and asked their advice 
‘i wondered when you would think of it ’ said frodo  ‘open it ’
inside it was filled with a grey dust  soft and fine  in the middle of which
was a seed  like a small nut with a silver shale  ‘what can i do with this ’
said sam 
‘throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work ’ said
pippin 
‘on what ’ said sam 
‘choose one spot as a nursery  and see what happens to the plants there ’
said merry 
‘but i’m sure the lady would not like me to keep it all for my own
garden  now so many folk have suffered ’ said sam 
‘use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own  sam ’ said frodo 
‘and then use the gift to help your work and better it  and use it sparingly 
there is not much here  and i expect every grain has a value ’
so sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or
beloved trees had been destroyed  and he put a grain of the precious dust in the
soil at the root of each  he went up and down the shire in this labour  but if
he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him  and at the
end he found that he still had a little of the dust left  so he went to the
three-farthing stone  which is as near the centre of the shire as no matter  and
cast it in the air with his blessing  the little silver nut he planted in the
party field where the tree had once been  and he wondered what would come of it 
all through the winter he remained as patient as he could  and tried to restrain
himself from going round constantly to see if anything was happening 
spring surpassed his wildest hopes  his trees began to sprout and grow  as if
time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty  in the party
field a beautiful young sapling leaped up  it had silver bark and long leaves
and burst into golden flowers in april  it was indeed a mallorn  and it
was the wonder of the neighbourhood  in after years  as it grew in grace and
beauty  it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys to see it 
the only mallorn west of the mountains and east of the sea  and one of
the finest in the world 
altogether 1420 in the shire was a marvellous year  not only was there
wonderful sunshine and delicious rain  in due times and perfect measure  but
there seemed something more  an air of richness and growth  and a gleam of a
beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this
middle-earth  all the children born or begotten in that year  and there were
many  were fair to see and strong  and most of them had a rich golden hair that
had before been rare among hobbits  the fruit was so plentiful that young
hobbits very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream  and later they sat on the
lawns under the plum-trees and ate  until they had made piles of stones like
small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror  and then they moved on  and
no one was ill  and everyone was pleased  except those who had to mow the grass 
in the southfarthing the vines were laden  and the yield of ‘leaf’ was
astonishing  and everywhere there was so much corn that at harvest every barn
was stuffed  ‘the northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of 1420 malt
was long remembered and became a byword  indeed a generation later one might
hear an old gaffer in an inn  after a good pint of well-earned ale  put down his
mug with a sigh  ‘ah  that was proper fourteen-twenty  that was ’
sam stayed at first at the cottons’ with frodo  but when the new row was
ready he went with the gaffer  in addition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end  but he was often away in the
shire on his forestry work  so he was not at home in early march and did not
know that frodo had been ill  on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton
found frodo lying on his bed  he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain
about his neck and he seemed half in a dream 
‘it is gone for ever ’ he said  ‘and now all is dark and empty ’
but the fit passed  and when sam got back on the twenty-fifth  frodo had
recovered  and he said nothing about himself  in the meanwhile bag end had been
set in order  and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back all
the old furniture and gear  so that the old hole soon looked very much as it
always had done 
when all was at last ready frodo said  ‘when are you going to move in and
join me  sam ’
sam looked a bit awkward 
‘there is no need to come yet  if you don’t want to ’ said frodo 
‘but you know the gaffer is close at hand  and he will be very well looked
after by widow rumble ’
it s not that  mr  frodo  said sam  and he went very red 
‘well  what is it ’
‘it’s rosie  rose cotton ’ said sam  ‘it seems she didn’t like my
going abroad at all  poor lass  but as i hadn’t spoken  she couldn’t say so 
and i didn’t speak  because i had a job to do first  but now i have spoken 
and she says  “well  you’ve wasted a year  so why wait longer ”
“wasted ” i says  “i wouldn’t call it that ” still i see what she
means  i feel torn in two  as you might say ’
‘i see ’ said frodo  ‘you want to get married  and yet you want to live
with me in bag end too  but my dear sam  how easy  get married as soon as you
can  and then move in with rosie  there’s room enough in bag end for as big a
family as you could wish for ’
and so it was settled  sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring of 1420
 which was also famous for its weddings   and they came and lived at bag end 
and if sam thought himself lucky  frodo knew that he was more lucky himself  for
there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with such care  when
the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet
life  writing a great deal and going through all his notes  he resigned the
office of deputy mayor at the free fair that mid-summer  and dear old will
whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at banquets 
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow  and there was
much coming and going between buckland and bag end  the two young travellers cut
a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales and their finery  and
their wonderful parties  ‘lordly’ folk called them  meaning nothing but
good  for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts
so bright and their shields so splendid  laughing and singing songs of far away 
and if they were now large and magnificent  they were unchanged otherwise 
unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment
than ever before 
frodo and sam  however  went back to ordinary attire  except that when there
was need they both wore long grey cloaks  finely woven and clasped at the throat
with beautiful brooches  and mr  frodo wore always a white jewel on a chain that
he often would finger 
all things now went well  with hope always of becoming still better  and sam
was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish  nothing for him
marred that whole year  except for some vague anxiety about his master  frodo
dropped quietly out of all the doings of the shire  and sam was pained to notice
how little honour he had in his own country  few people knew or wanted to know
about his deeds and adventures  their admiration and respect were given mostly
to mr  meriadoc and mr  peregrin and  if sam had known it  to himself  also in
the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles 
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very
strange  he was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away 
‘what’s the matter  mr  frodo ’ said sam 
‘i am wounded ’ he answered  ‘wounded  it will never really heal ’
but then he got up  and the turn seemed to pass  and he was quite himself the
next day  it was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the date was
october the sixth  two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under
weathertop 
time went on  and 1421 came in  frodo was ill again in march  but with a
great effort he concealed it  for sam had other things to think about  the first
of sam and rosie’s children was born on the twenty-fifth of march  a date that
sam noted 
‘well  mr  frodo ’ he said  ‘i’m in a bit of a fix  rose and me had
settled to call him frodo  with your leave  but it’s not him  it’s her 
though as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope for  taking after rose more
than me  luckily  so we don’t know what to do ’
‘well  sam ’ said frodo  ‘what’s wrong with the old customs  choose a
flower name like rose  half the maidchildren in the shire are called by such
names  and what could be better ’
‘i suppose you’re right  mr  frodo ’ said sam  ‘i’ve heard some
beautiful names on my travels  but i suppose they’re a bit too grand for daily
wear and tear  as you might say  the gaffer  he says  “make it short  and then
you won’t have to cut it short before you can use it ” but if it’s to be a
flower-name  then i don’t trouble about the length  it must be a beautiful
flower  because  you see  i think she is very beautiful  and is going to be
beautifuller still ’
frodo thought for a moment  ‘well  sam  what about elanor 
the sun-star  you remember the little golden flower in the grass of lothlórien ’
‘you’re right again  mr  frodo ’ said sam delighted  ‘that’s what i
wanted ’
little elanor was nearly six months old  and 1421 had passed to its autumn 
when frodo called sam into the study 
‘it will be bilbo’s birthday on thursday  sam ’ he said  ‘and he will
pass the old took  he will be a hundred and thirty-one ’
‘so he will ’ said sam  ‘he’s a marvel ’
‘well  sam ’ said frodo  ‘i want you to see rose and find out if she
can spare you  so that you and i can go off together  you can’t go far or for
a long time now  of course ’ he said a little wistfully 
‘well  not very well  mr  frodo ’
‘of course not  but never mind  you can see me on my way  tell rose that
you won’t be away very long  not more than a fortnight  and you’ll come back
quite safe ’
‘i wish i could go all the way with you to rivendell  mr  frodo  and see
mr  bilbo ’ said sam  ‘and yet the only place i really want to be in is
here  i am that torn in two ’
‘poor sam  it will feel like that  i am afraid ’ said frodo  ‘but you
will be healed  you were meant to be solid and whole  and you will be ’
in the next day or two frodo went through his papers and his writings with
sam  and he handed over his keys  there was a big book with plain red leather
covers  its tall pages were now almost filled  at the beginning there were many
leaves covered with bilbo’s thin wandering hand  but most of it was written in
frodo’s firm flowing script  it was divided into chapters but chapter 80 was
unfinished  and after that were some blank leaves  the title page had many
titles on it  crossed out one after another  so 
my diary  my unexpected journey  there and back again  and what happened
after 
adventures of five hobbits  the tale of the great ring  compiled by bilbo
baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his friends  what we did
in the war of the ring 
here bilbo’s hand ended and frodo had written 
the downfall

of the

lord of the rings

and the

return of the king

 as seen by the little people  being the memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the
shire  supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of the
wise  
together with extracts from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivendell 
‘why  you have nearly finished it  mr  frodo ’ sam exclaimed  ‘well 
you have kept at it  i must say ’
‘i have quite finished  sam ’ said frodo  ‘the last pages are for
you ’
on september the twenty-first they set out together  frodo on the pony that
had borne him all the way from minas tirith  and was now called strider  and sam
on his beloved bill  it was a fair golden morning  and sam did not ask where
they were going  he thought he could guess 
they took the stock road over the hills and went towards the woody end  and
they let their ponies walk at their leisure  they camped in the green hills  and
on september the twenty-second they rode gently down into the beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away 
‘if that isn’t the very tree you hid behind when the black rider first
showed up  mr  frodo ’ said sam pointing to the left  ‘it seems like a dream
now ’
it was evening  and the stars were glimmering in the eastern sky as they
passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the hill between the
hazel-thickets  sam was silent  deep in his memories  presently he became aware
that frodo was singing softly to himself  singing the old walking-song  but the
words were not quite the same 
still round the corner there may wait

a new road or a secret gate 

and though i oft have passed them by 

a day will come at last when i

shall take the hidden paths that run

west of the moon  east of the sun 
and as if in answer  from down below  coming up the road out of the valley 
voices sang 
a  elbereth gilthoniel 

silivren penna míriel

o menel aglar elenath 

gilthoniel  a  elbereth 

 
we still remember  we who dwell

in this far land beneath the trees

the starlight on the western seas 
frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows  until they saw a
shimmer as the travellers came towards them 
there was gildor and many fair elven folk  and there to sam’s wonder rode
elrond and galadriel  elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his
forehead  and a silver harp was in his hand  and upon his finger was a ring of
gold with a great blue stone  vilya  mightiest of the three  but galadriel sat
upon a white palfrey and was robed all in glimmering white  like clouds about
the moon  for she herself seemed to shine with a soft light  on her finger was
nenya  the ring wrought of mithril  that bore a single white stone
flickering like a frosty star  riding slowly behind on a small grey pony  and
seeming to nod in his sleep  was bilbo himself 
elrond greeted them gravely and graciously  and galadriel smiled upon them 
‘well  master samwise ’ she said  ‘i hear and see that you have used my
gift well  the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved ’ sam
bowed  but found nothing to say  he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was 
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes  ‘hullo  frodo ’ he said  ‘well 
i have passed the old took today  so that’s settled  and now i think i am
quite ready to go on another journey  are you coming ’
‘yes  i am coming ’ said frodo  ‘the ring-bearers should go
together ’
‘where are you going  master ’ cried sam  though at last he understood
what was happening 
‘to the havens  sam ’ said frodo 
‘and i can’t come ’
‘no  sam  not yet anyway  not further than the havens  though you too were
a ring-bearer  if only for a little while  your time may come  do not be too
sad  sam  you cannot be always torn in two  you will have to be one and whole 
for many years  you have so much to enjoy and to be  and to do ’
‘but ’ said sam  and tears started in his eyes  ‘i thought you were
going to enjoy the shire  too  for years and years  after all you have done ’
‘so i thought too  once  but i have been too deeply hurt  sam  i tried to
save the shire  and it has been saved  but not for me  it must often be so  sam 
when things are in danger  some one has to give them up  lose them  so that
others may keep them  but you are my heir  all that i had and might have had i
leave to you  and also you have rose  and elanor  and frodo-lad will come  and
rosie-lass  and merry  and goldilocks  and pippin  and perhaps more that i
cannot see  your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere  you will be the
mayor  of course  as long as you want to be  and the most famous gardener in
history  and you will read things out of the red book  and keep alive the memory
of the age that is gone  so that people will remember the great danger and so
love their beloved land all the more  and that will keep you as busy and as
happy as anyone can be  as long as your part of the story goes on 
‘come now  ride with me ’
then elrond and galadriel rode on  for the third age was over  and the days
of the rings were passed  and an end was come of the story and song of those
times  with them went many elves of the high kindred who would no longer stay in
middle-earth  and among them  filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and
without bitterness  rode sam  and frodo  and bilbo  and the elves delighted to
honour them 
though they rode through the midst of the shire all the evening and all the
night  none saw them pass  save the wild creatures  or here and there some
wanderer in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the trees  or a light and
shadow flowing through the grass as the moon went westward  and when they had
passed from the shire  going about the south skirts of the white downs  they
came to the far downs  and to the towers  and looked on the distant sea  and so
they rode down at last to mithlond  to the grey havens in the long firth of
lune 
as they came to the gates círdan the shipwright came forth to greet
them  very tall he was  and his beard was long  and he was grey and old 
save that his eyes were keen as stars  and he looked at them and bowed  and
said  ‘all is now ready ’
then círdan led them to the havens  and there was a white ship lying 
and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in
white awaiting them  as he turned and came towards them frodo saw that gandalf
now wore openly upon his hand the third ring  narya the great  and the stone
upon it was red as fire  then those who were to go were glad  for they knew that
gandalf also would take ship with them 
but sam was now sorrowful at heart  and it seemed to him that if the parting
would be bitter  more grievous still would be the long road home alone  but even
as they stood there  and the elves were going aboard  and all was being made
ready to depart  up rode merry and pippin in great haste  and amid his tears
pippin laughed 
‘you tried to give us the slip once before and failed  frodo ’ he said 
‘this time you have nearly succeeded  but you have failed again  it was not
sam  though  that gave you away this time  but gandalf himself ’
‘yes ’ said gandalf  ‘for it will be better to ride back three together
‘than one alone  well  here at last  dear friends  on the shores of the sea
comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth  go in peace  i will not say  do
not weep  for not all tears are an evil ’
then frodo kissed merry and pippin  and last of all sam  and went aboard  and
the sails were drawn up  and the wind blew  and slowly the ship slipped away
down the long grey firth  and the light of the glass of galadriel that frodo
bore glimmered and was lost  and the ship went out into the high sea and passed
on into the west  until at last on a night of rain frodo smelled a sweet
fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water 
and then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of bombadil  the
grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back  and he beheld
white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise 
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven  and as
he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost
in the west  there still he stood far into the night  hearing only the sigh and
murmur of the waves on the shores of middle-earth  and the sound of them sank
deep into his heart  beside him stood merry and pippin  and they were silent 
at last the three companions turned away  and never again looking back they
rode slowly homewards  and they spoke no word to one another until they came
back to the shire  but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey
road 
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road  and then merry and
pippin rode on to buckland  and already they were singing again as they went 
but sam turned to bywater  and so came back up the hill  as day was ending once
more  and he went on  and there was yellow light  and fire within  and the
evening meal was ready  and he was expected  and rose drew him in  and set him
in his chair  and put little elanor upon his lap 
he drew a deep breath  ‘well  i’m back ’ he said
