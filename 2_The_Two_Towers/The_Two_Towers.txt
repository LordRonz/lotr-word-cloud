aragorn sped on up the hill every now and again he bent to the ground
hobbits go light and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger to read
but not far from the top a spring crossed the path and in the wet earth he saw
what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself frodo ran to the hill-top i
wonder what he saw there but he returned by the same way and went down the
hill again
aragorn hesitated he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping to see
there something that would guide him in his perplexities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across the great flag-stones
and up the steps then sitting in the high seat he looked out but the sun
seemed darkened and the world dim and remote he turned from the north back
again to north and saw nothing save the distant hills unless it were that far
away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air descending
slowly in wide circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below on the
west side of the river he stiffened there were cries and among them to his
horror he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs then suddenly with a
deep-throated call a great horn blew and the blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromir he cried he is in need he sprang down the steps
and away leaping down the path alas an ill fate is on me this day and all
that i do goes amiss where is sam
as he ran the cries came louder but fainter now and desperately the horn was
blowing fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the
horn-calls ceased aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could reach
the hills foot the sounds died away and as he turned to the left and ran
towards them they retreated until at last he could hear them no more drawing
his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the
trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a little glade not far from the lake he
found boromir he was sitting with his back to a great tree as if he was
resting but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows
his sword was still in his hand but it was broken near the hilt his horn
cloven in two was at his side many orcs lay slain piled all about him and at
his feet
aragorn knelt beside him boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak at
last slow words came i tried to take the ring from frodo  he said i am
sorry i have paid his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least
lay there they have gone: the halflings: the orcs have taken them i think
they are not dead orcs bound them he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no said aragorn taking his hand and kissing his brow you have
conquered few have gained such a victory be at peace minas tirith shall not
fall
boromir smiled
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
alas said aragorn thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower of
guard this is a bitter end now the company is all in ruin it is i that have
failed vain was gandalfs trust in me what shall i do now boromir has laid it
on me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires it but where are the ring and
the bearer how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand so it
was that legolas and gimli found him they came from the western slopes of the
hill silently creeping through the trees as if they were hunting gimli had
his axe in hand and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent when
they came into the glade they halted in amazement and then they stood a moment
with heads bowed in grief for it seemed to them plain what had happened
alas said legolas coming to aragorns side we have hunted and slain
many orcs in the woods but we should have been of more use here we came when
we heard the horn-but too late it seems i fear you have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn i am unscathed for i was not here with
him he fell defending the hobbits while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cried gimli where are they then where is frodo
i do not know answered aragorn wearily before he died boromir told me
that the orcs had bound them he did not think that they were dead i sent him
to follow merry and pippin but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him:
not until it was too late all that i have done today has gone amiss what is to
be done now
first we must tend the fallen said legolas we cannot leave him lying
like carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimli he would not wish us to linger we must
follow the orcs if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners
but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not  said
aragorn are we to abandon him must we not seek him first an evil choice is
now before us
then let us do first what we must do said legolas we have not the time
or the tools to bury our comrade fitly or to raise a mound over him a cairn we
might build
the labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use
nearer than the water-side said gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons and the weapons of his
vanquished foes said aragorn we will send him to the falls of rauros and
give him to anduin the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil
creature dishonours his bones
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs gathering their swords and
cloven helms and shields into a heap see cried aragorn here we find
tokens he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives leaf-bladed
damasked in gold and red and searching further he found also the sheaths
black set with small red gems no orc-tools these he said they were borne
by the hobbits doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing them for what they are: work of westernesse wound about with
spells for the bane of mordor well now if they still live our friends are
weaponless i will take these things hoping against hope to give them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows that i can find for my
quiver is empty he searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not
a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs
were accustomed to use he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said: here lie many that are not
folk of mordor some are from the north from the misty mountains if i know
anything of orcs and their kinds and here are others strange to me their gear
is not after the manner of orcs at all
there were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature swart slant-eyed with
thick legs and large hands they were armed with short broad-bladed swords not
with the curved scimitars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew in length
and shape like the bows of men upon their shields they bore a strange device: a
small white hand in the centre of a black field on the front of their iron
helms was set an s-rune wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before said aragorn what do they mean
s is for sauron said gimli that is easy to read
nay said legolas sauron does not use the elf-runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit it to be spelt or spoken
said aragorn and he does not use white the orcs in the service of barad-dûr
use the sign of the red eye he stood for a moment in thought s is for
saruman i guess he said at length there is evil afoot in isengard and the
west is no longer safe it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of our journey it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs
fall pursuers from moria may have escaped the
vigilance of lórien or they may have avoided that land and come to
isengard by other paths orcs travel fast but saruman has many ways of learning
news do you remember the birds
well we have no time to ponder riddles said gimli let us bear boromir
away
but after that we must guess the riddles if we are to choose our course
rightly answered aragorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches these they lashed together
with bowstrings and spread their cloaks upon the frame upon this rough bier
they carried the body of their companion to the shore together with such
trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him it was only a
short way yet they found it no easy task for boromir was a man both tall and
strong
at the water-side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas and
gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen it was a mile or more and it was
some time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is a strange tale to tell said legolas there are only two boats
upon the bank we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli and orcs would have taken or
destroyed all the boats and the baggage as well
i will look at the ground when we come there said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and
placed beneath his head they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his
shoulders the golden belt of lórien gleamed about his waist his helm
they set beside him and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts
and shards of his sword beneath his feet they put the swords of his
enemies then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat they drew him
out into the water they rowed sadly along the shore and turning into the
swift-running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen the steep
sides of tol brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon as they went south
the fume of rauros rose and shimmered before them a haze of gold the rush and
thunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there boromir lay restful
peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water the stream took him while
they held their own boat back with their paddles he floated by them and slowly
his boat departed waning to a dark spot against the golden light and then
suddenly it vanished rauros roared on unchanging the river had taken boromir
son of denethor and he was not seen again in minas tirith standing as he used
to stand upon the white tower in the morning but in gondor in after-days it
long was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and bore
him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths of anduin out into the
great sea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him then
aragorn spoke they will look for him from the white tower he said but he
will not return from mountain or from sea then slowly he began to sing:
through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows

the west wind comes walking and about the walls it goes

what news from the west o wandering wind do you bring to me tonight

have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight

i saw him ride over seven streams over waters wide and grey

i saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away

into the shadows of the north i saw him then no more

the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor

o boromir from the high walls westward i looked afar

but you came not from the empty lands where no men are
then legolas sang:
from the mouths of the sea the south wind flies from the sandhills and
the stones

the wailing of the gulls it bears and at the gate it moans

what news from the south o sighing wind do you bring to me at eve

where now is boromir the fair he tarries and i grieve

ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie

on the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky

so many have passed down anduin to find the flowing sea

ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me

o boromir beyond the gate the seaward road runs south

but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again:
from the gate of kings the north wind rides and past the roaring falls

and clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls

what news from the north o mighty wind do you bring to me today

what news of boromir the bold for he is long away

beneath amon hen i heard his cry there many foes he fought

his cloven shield his broken sword they to the water brought

his head so proud his face so fair his limbs they laid to rest

and rauros golden rauros-falls bore him upon its breast

o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze

to rauros golden rauros-falls until the end of days
so they ended then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed
they could against the stream back to parth galen
you left the east wind to me said gimli but i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aragorn in minas tirith they endure the
east wind but they do not ask it for tidings but now boromir has taken his
road and we must make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the
earth the orcs have been on this ground he said otherwise nothing can be
made out for certain all our footprints are here crossing and re-crossing i
cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for frodo
began he returned to the bank close to where the rill from the spring
trickled out into the river there are some clear prints here he said a
hobbit waded out into the water and back but i cannot say how long ago
how then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn did not answer at once but went back to the camping-place and looked
at the baggage two packs are missing he said and one is certainly sams:
it was rather large and heavy this then is the answer: frodo has gone by boat
and his servant has gone with him frodo must have returned while we were all
away i met sam going up the hill and told him to follow me but plainly he did
not do so he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had
gone he did not find it easy to leave sam behind
but why should he leave us behind and without a word said gimli that
was a strange deed
and a brave deed said aragorn sam was right i think frodo did not wish
to lead any friend to death with him in mordor but he knew that he must go
himself something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs what he
thought was the cause of frodos sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir he long kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said legolas: frodo is no longer on
this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat and sam is with him
only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take the remaining boat and
follow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot there is little hope either
way we have already lost precious hours
let me think said aragorn and now may i make a right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment i will follow
the orcs he said at last i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him now in the wilderness i must abandon the
captives to torment and death my heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the
bearer is in my hands no longer the company has played its part yet we that
remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left come we will
go now leave all that can be spared behind we will press on by day and dark
they drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees they laid beneath it
such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away then they
left parth galen the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where
boromir had fallen there they picked up the trail of the orcs it needed little
skill to find
no other folk make such a trampling said legolas it seems their delight
to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all that said aragorn and they do not
tire and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands
well after them said gimli dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not
tire sooner than orcs but it will be a long chase: they have a long start
yes said aragorn we shall all need the endurance of dwarves but come
with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies and woe to
them if we prove the swifter we will make such a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel among the three kindreds µ elves dwarves and men forth the three
hunters
like a deer he sprang away through the trees he sped on and on he led them
tireless and swift now that his mind was at last made up the woods about the
lake they left behind long slopes they climbed dark hard-edged against the
sky already red with sunset dusk came they passed away grey shadows in a
stony land
 
dusk deepened mist lay behind them among the trees below and brooded on the
pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear stars came out the waxing
moon was riding in the west and the shadows of the rocks were black they had
come to the feet of stony hills and their pace was slower for the trail was no
longer easy to follow here the highlands of the emyn muil ran from north to
south in two long tumbled ridges the western side of each ridge was steep and
difficult but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and
narrow ravines all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land
climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge and down again into the
darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space the
moon had long gone down before them the stars glittered above them the first
light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind for the moment aragorn
was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley but there it had
vanished
which way would they turn do you think said legolas northward to take a
straighter road to isengard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guess or
southward to strike the entwash
they will not make for the river whatever mark they aim at said aragorn
and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatly
increased they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of
the rohirrim let us search northwards
the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills and a trickling
stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom a cliff frowned upon their
right to their left rose grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night they
went on for a mile or more northwards aragorn was searching bent towards the
ground among the folds and gullies leading up into the western ridge legolas
was some way ahead suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running
towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had at first taken to be
boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies five dead orcs lay
there they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli but it needs the light of day and for
that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas enemies of
the orcs are likely to be our friends do any folk dwell in these hills
no said aragorn the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from minas
tirith it might be that some company of men were hunting here for reasons that
we do not know yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far away among the slain are none of the great
orcs with the strange badges there was a quarrel i guess: it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk maybe there was some dispute about the road
or about the captives said gimli let us hope that they too did not
meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but no other traces of the
fight could be found they went on already the eastward sky was turning pale
the stars were fading and a grey light was slowly growing a little further
north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a
stony path down into the valley in it some bushes grew and there were patches
of grass upon its sides
at last said aragorn here are the tracks that we seek up this
water-channel: this is the way that the orcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path as if fresh from a
nights rest they sprang from stone to stone at last they reached the crest of
the grey hill and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks:
the chill wind of dawn
turning back they saw across the river the far hills kindled day leaped into
the sky the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land before
them in the west the world lay still formless and grey but even as they
looked the shadows of night melted the colours of the waking earth returned:
green flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white mists shimmered in the
watervales and far off to the left thirty leagues or more blue and purple
stood the white mountains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering
snows flushed with the rose of morning
gondor gondor cried aragorn would that i looked on you again in happier
hour not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountains and the sea

west wind blew there the light upon the silver tree

fell like bright rain in gardens of the kings of old

o proud walls white towers o winged crown and throne of gold

o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver tree

or west wind blow again between the mountains and the sea
now let us go he said drawing his eyes away from the south and looking
out west and north to the way that he must tread
the ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their
feet below it twenty fathoms or more there was a wide and rugged shelf which
ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the east wall of rohan so ended
the emyn muil and the green plains of the rohirrim stretched away before them
to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them there is
the eagle again he is very high he seems to be flying now away from this land
back to the north he is going with great speed look
no not even my eyes can see him my good legolas said aragorn he must
be far aloft indeed i wonder what is his errand if he is the same bird that i
have seen before but look i can see something nearer at hand and more urgent
there is something moving over the plain
many things said legolas it is a great company on foot but i cannot say
more nor see what kind of folk they may be they are many leagues away: twelve
i guess but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way
to go said gimli let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orcs chose
said aragorn
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day it seemed that the
orcs had pressed on with all possible speed every now and again the pursuers
found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags the rinds and crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the
stones the trail led them north along the top of the escarpment and at length
they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily
down in the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the
plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan it
swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the emyn muil the falling
stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants and they could
hear it tinkling away in green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens
of entwash vale far away they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills
behind here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented as if spring
was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf legolas
took a deep breath like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in
barren places
ah the green smell he said it is better than much sleep let us run
light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn more swiftly maybe than
iron-shod orcs now we have a chance to lessen their lead
they went in single file running like hounds on a strong scent and an eager
light was in their eyes nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had been bruised and blackened
as they passed presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside stay he
shouted do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the right away from the main
trail for he had seen footprints that went that way branching off from the
others the marks of small unshod feet these however did not go far before
they were crossed by orc-prints also coming out from the main trail behind and
in front and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the
trampling at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something from
the grass then he ran back
yes he said they are quite plain: a hobbits footprints pippins i
think he is smaller than the other and look at this he held up a thing that
glittered in the sunlight it looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree
fair and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven-cloak cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves of lórien fall said aragorn this did not
drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow i
think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli and he had the use of his wits
and of his legs too that is heartening we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle
burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky light clouds
came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
the sun sank shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east still
the hunters held on one day now had passed since boromir fell and the orcs
were yet far ahead no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level
plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted only twice in the days
march had they rested for a brief while and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he said shall we rest by night or
shall we go on while our will and strength hold
unless our enemies rest also they will leave us far behind if we stay to
sleep said legolas surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun yet these have done so
said legolas certainly they will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left as far as my eyes
can see said legolas
maybe i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line said
aragorn but if we strayed or they turned aside then when light came there
might be long delay before the trail was found again
and there is this also said gimli: only by day can we see if any tracks
lead away if a prisoner should escape or if one should be carried off
eastward say to the great river towards mordor we might pass the signs and
never know it
that is true said aragorn but if i read the signs back yonder rightly
the orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company is now bound for
isengard their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli and what of
escape in the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard since then and the prisoners even
wearier said legolas there will be no escape again if we do not contrive
it how that is to be done cannot be guessed but first we must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and not the least hardy of my folk
cannot run all the way to isengard without any pause  said gimli my heart
burns me too and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to
run the better and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn how shall we end this
debate
you are our guide said gimli and you are skilled in the chase you shall
choose
my heart bids me go on said legolas but we must hold together i will
follow your counsel
you give the choice to an ill chooser said aragorn since we passed
through the argonath my choices have gone amiss he fell silent gazing north
and west into the gathering night for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said at length the peril of missing the
trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater if the moon
gave enough light we would use it but alas he sets early and is yet young and
pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured would that the lady had
given us a light such a gift as she gave to frodo
it will be more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn with him lies
the true quest ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time a
vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice of mine can mar or mend
well i have chosen so let us use the time as best we may
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep for he had not
slept since their night under the shadow of tol brandir before dawn was in the
sky he woke and rose gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing northwards into the darkness thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a
windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn i know in my
heart that they have not rested this night only an eagle could overtake them
now
nonetheless we will still follow as we may said aragorn stooping he
roused the dwarf come we must go he said the scent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli even legolas on a hill-top could not see
them till the sun is up
i fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain under moon or
sun said legolas
where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn the land
must groan under their hated feet he stretched himself upon the ground with
his ear pressed against the turf he lay there motionless for so long a time
that gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again dawn came
glimmering and slowly a grey light grew about them at last he rose and now
his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn and his look was
troubled
the rumour of the earth is dim and confused he said nothing walks upon
it for many miles about us faint and far are the feet of our enemies but loud
are the hoofs of the horses it comes to my mind that i heard them even as i
lay on the ground in sleep and they troubled my dreams: horses galloping
passing in the west but now they are drawing ever further from us riding
northward i wonder what is happening in this land
let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began during all its long hours of cloud
and fitful sun they hardly paused now striding now running as if no weariness
could quench the fire that burned them they seldom spoke over the wide
solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the background of the
grey-green fields even in the cool sunlight of
mid-day few but elvish eyes would have marked them until they were close at
hand often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lórien for the gift
of lembas for they could eat of it and find new strength even as
they ran
all day the track of their enemies led straight on going north-west without
a break or turn as once again the day wore to its end they came to long
treeless slopes where the land rose swelling up towards a line of low
humpbacked downs ahead the orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards
them for the ground became harder and the grass shorter far away to the left
the river entwash wound a silver thread in a green floor no moving thing could
be seen often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man the
dwellings of the rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the south
under the wooded eaves of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud yet
the horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the eastemnet this
easterly region of their realm and there the herdsmen had wandered much living
in camp and tent even in winter-time but now all the land was empty and there
was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the
plains of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the shadows of the
east the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky but it gave small light and
the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase  said legolas
the orcs have run before us as if the very whips of sauron were behind them i
fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills and even now are
passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground his teeth this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our
toil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn we shall not turn back
here yet i am weary he gazed back along the way that they had come towards
the night gathering in the east there is something strange at work in this
land i distrust the silence i distrust even the pale moon the stars are
faint and i am weary as i have seldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow there is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than
in the limb
truly said legolas that i have known since first we came down from the
emyn muil for the will is not behind us but before us he pointed away over
the land of rohan into the darkling west under the sickle moon saruman
muttered aragorn but he shall not turn us back halt we must once more for
see even the moon is falling into gathering cloud but north lies our road
between down and fen when day returns
as before legolas was first afoot if indeed he had ever slept awake
awake he cried it is a red dawn strange things await us by the eaves of the
forest good or evil i do not know but we are called awake
the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again slowly the downs
drew near it was still an hour before noon when they reached them: green slopes
rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the north at their
feet the ground was dry and the turf short but a long strip of sunken land
some ten miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim
thickets of reed and rush just to the west of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc-trail ran out again turning north along the dry skirts of the
hills aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the outward trail is already
old i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas: it is thrice twelve hours i
guess since the orcs stood where we now stand if they held to their pace then
at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn
i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist said
gimli could we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn if i remember rightly these downs run
eight leagues or more to the north and then north-west to the issuing of the
entwash there lies still a wide land another fifteen leagues it may be
well let us go on said gimli my legs must forget the miles they would
be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of
downs for many hours they had marched without rest they were going slowly now
and gimlis back was bent stone-hard are the dwarves in labour or journey but
this endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and again to scan some
print or mark upon the ground only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever
his feet hardly seeming to press the grass leaving no footprints as he passed
but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed and
he could sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting his mind in the
strange paths of elvish dreams even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this
world
let us go up on to this green hill he said wearily they followed him
climbing the long slope until they came out upon the top it was a round hill
smooth and bare standing by itself the most northerly of the downs the sun
sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain they were alone in a grey
formless world without mark or measure only far away north-west there was a
deeper darkness against the dying light: the mountains of mist and the forest at
their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli well now we must halt
again and wear the night away it is growing cold
the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said legolas but rest if you
must yet do not cast all hope away tomorrow is unknown rede oft is found at
the rising of the sun
three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel  said
gimli
the night grew ever colder aragorn and gimli slept fitfully and whenever
they awoke they saw legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro singing
softly to himself in his own tongue and as he sang the white stars opened in
the hard black vault above so the night passed together they watched the dawn
grow slowly in the sky now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear the wind was in the east and all the mists had rolled
away wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the wold of rohan that they
had already glimpsed many days ago from the great river north-westward stalked
the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves and
its further slopes faded into the distant blue beyond there glimmered far away
as if floating on a grey cloud the white head of tall methedras the last peak
of the misty mountains out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them its
stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep-cloven the orc-trail turned
from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river and then the river back
towards the forest aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green a dark
swift-moving blur he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently
but legolas stood beside him shading his bright elven-eyes with his long
slender hand and he saw not a shadow nor a blur but the small figures of
horsemen many horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears
was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight far behind
them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
there was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli could hear the air moving
in the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet many riders on swift steeds
are coming towards us
yes said legolas there are one hundred and five yellow is their hair
and bright are their spears their leader is very tall
aragorn smiled keen are the eyes of the elves he said
nay the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leagues or one said gimli we cannot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them here or go on our way
we will wait said aragorn i am weary and our hunt has failed or at
least others were before us for these horsemen are riding back down the
orc-trail we may get new s from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn but evil or
good we will await it here
the three companions now left the hill-top where they might be an easy mark
against the pale sky and they walked slowly down the northward slope a little
above the hills foot they halted and wrapping their cloaks about them they
sat huddled together upon the faded grass the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching gimli was uneasy
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said do we sit here
waiting for sudden death
i have been among them answered aragorn they are proud and wilful but
they are true-hearted generous in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise
but unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after the manner of the
children of men before the dark years but i do not know what has happened here
of late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman
and the threat of sauron they have long been the friends of the people of
gondor though they are not akin to them it was in forgotten years long ago
that eorl the young brought them out of the north and their kinship is rather
with the bardings of dale and with the beornings of the wood among whom may
still be seen many men tall and fair as are the riders of rohan at least they
will not love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor  said gimli
i believe it no more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth said legolas already they approach
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs the
horsemen following the trail had turned from the river and were drawing near
the downs they were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields suddenly
they swept up with a noise like thunder and the foremost horseman swerved
passing by the foot of the hill and leading the host back southward along the
western skirts of the downs after him they rode: a long line of mail-clad men
swift shining fell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong and clean-limbed their grey coats
glistened their long tails flowed in the wind their manes were braided on
their proud necks the men that rode them matched them well: tall and
long-limbed their hair flaxen-pale flowed under their light helms and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces were stern and keen in their
hands were tall spears of ash painted shields were slung at their backs long
swords were at their belts their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their
knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and then one rose in his
stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side they appeared not to perceive the
three strangers sitting silently and watching them the host had almost passed
when suddenly aragorn stood up and called in a loud voice:
what news from the north riders of rohan
with astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds wheeled and came
charging round soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen
moving in a running circle up the hill-slope behind them and down round and
round them and drawing ever inwards aragorn stood silent and the other two
sat without moving wondering what way things would turn
without a word or cry suddenly the riders halted a thicket of spears were
pointed towards the strangers and some of the horsemen had bows in hand and
their arrows were already fitted to the string then one rode forward a tall
man taller than all the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail
flowed he advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of aragorns
breast aragorn did not stir
who are you and what are you doing in this land said the rider using the
common speech of the west in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man
of gondor
i am called strider answered aragorn i came out of the north i am
hunting orcs
the rider leaped from his horse giving his spear to another who rode up and
dismounted at his side he drew his sword and stood face to face with aragorn
surveying him keenly and not without wonder at length he spoke again
at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he said but now i see
that it is not so indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them in
this fashion they were swift and well-armed and they were many you would have
changed from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them but there is
something strange about you strider he bent his clear bright eyes again upon
the ranger that is no name for a man that you give and strange too is your
raiment have you sprung out of the grass how did you escape our sight are you
elvish folk
no said aragorn one only of us is an elf legolas from the woodland
realm in distant mirkwood but we have passed through lothlórien and the
gifts and favour of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder but his eyes hardened then
there is a lady in the golden wood as old tales tell he said few escape her
nets they say these are strange days but if you have her favour then you
also are net-weavers and sorcerers maybe he turned a cold glance suddenly
upon legolas and gimli why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the handle of
his axe and his dark eyes flashed give me your name horse-master and i will
give you mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring down at the dwarf the stranger
should declare himself first yet i am named éomer son of éomund
and am called the third marshal of riddermark
then éomer son of éomund third marshal of riddermark let
gimli the dwarf glóins son warn you against foolish words you speak
evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought and only little wit
can excuse you
éomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured angrily and closed
in advancing their spears i would cut off your head beard and all master
dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground  said éomer
he stands not alone said legolas bending his bow and fitting an arrow
with hands that moved quicker than sight you would die before your stroke
fell
éomer raised his sword and things might have gone ill but aragorn
sprang between them and raised his hand your pardon éomer he cried
when you know more you will understand why you have angered my
companions we intend no evil to rohan nor to any of its folk neither to man
nor to horse will you not hear our tale before you strike
i will said éomer lowering his blade but wanderers in the
riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt first tell
me your right name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn are you friend or foe of
sauron the dark lord of mordor
i serve only the lord of the mark théoden king son of thengel
answered éomer we do not serve the power of the black land far away
but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you are fleeing from him
then you had best leave this land there is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and to live as we have lived
keeping our own and serving no foreign lord good or evil we welcomed guests
kindly in the better days but in these times the unbidden stranger finds us
swift and hard come who are you whom do you serve at whose command do
you hunt orcs in our land
i serve no man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i pursue into
whatever land they may go there are few among mortal men who know more of orcs
and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice the orcs whom we pursued
took captive two of my friends in such need a man that has no horse will go on
foot and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail nor will he count the
heads of the enemy save with a sword i am not weaponless
aragorn threw back his cloak the elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it
and the bright blade of andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it
out elendil he cried i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dúnadan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor here
is the sword that was broken and is forged again will you aid me or thwart me
choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for they had not
seen him in this mood before he seemed to have
grown in stature while éomer had shrunk and in his living face they
caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone for a
moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows
of aragorn like a shining crown
éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face he cast down his
proud eyes these are indeed strange days he muttered dreams and legends
spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brings you here and what was the meaning of
the dark words long has boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer
and the horse that we lent him came back riderless what doom do you bring out
of the north
the doom of choice said aragorn you may say
this to théoden son of thengel: open war lies before him with sauron or
against him none may live now as they have lived and few shall keep what they
call their own but of these great matters we will speak later if chance
allows i will come myself to the king now i am in great need and i ask
for help or at least for tidings you heard that we are pursuing an orc-host
that carried off our friends what can you tell us
that you need not pursue them further said éomer the orcs are
destroyed
and our friends
we found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn did you search the slain were
there no bodies other than those of orc-kind they would be small only children
to your eyes unshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarves nor children said
éomer we counted all the slain and despoiled them and then we piled
the carcases and burned them as is our custom the ashes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwarves or children said gimli our friends were
hobbits
hobbits said éomer and what may they be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimli but these were very dear to
us it seems that you have heard in rohan of the words that troubled minas
tirith they spoke of the halfling these hobbits are halflings
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside éomer halflings
but they are only a little people in old songs and childrens tales out of the
north do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight
a man may do both said aragorn for not we but those who come after will
make the legends of our time the green earth say you that is a mighty matter
of legend though you tread it under the light of day
time is pressing said the rider not heeding aragorn we must hasten
south lord let us leave these wild folk to their fancies or let us bind them
and take them to the king
peace éothain said éomer in his own tongue leave me a
while tell the éored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to the entwade
muttering éothain retired and spoke to the others soon they drew off
and left éomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn he said yet you speak the truth
that is plain: the men of the mark do not lie and therefore they are not easily
deceived but you have not told all will you not now speak more fully of your
errand so that i may judge what to do
i set out from imladris as it is named in the rhyme many weeks ago
answered aragorn with me went boromir of minas tirith my errand was to go to
that city with the son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the company that i journeyed with had other business of that i cannot speak
now gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf éomer exclaimed gandalf greyhame is known in the mark:
but his name i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour he has
been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men coming as he will
after a season or after many years he is ever the herald of strange
events: a bringer of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss at
that time our trouble with saruman began until then we counted saruman our
friend hut gandalf came then and warned us that
sudden war was preparing in isengard he said that he himself had been a
prisoner in orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged for help but théoden
would not listen to him and he went away speak not the name of gandalf loudly
in théodens ears he is wroth for gandalf took the horse that is called
shadowfax the most precious of all the kings steeds chief of the mearas
which only the lord of the mark may ride for the sire of their race was the
great horse of eorl that knew the speech of men seven nights ago shadowfax
returned but the kings anger is not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle him
then shadowfax has found his way alone from the far north said aragorn
for it was there that he and gandalf parted but alas gandalf will ride no
longer he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said éomer at least to me and to many
though not to all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand though it
may touch them sorely ere the year is much older said aragorn but when the
great fall the less must lead my part it has been to guide our company on the
long road from moria through lórien we came
- of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it
again - and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed
your news is all of woe cried éomer in
dismay great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all that was a
worthy man all spoke his praise he came seldom to the mark for he was ever in
the wars on the east-borders but i have seen him more like to the swift
sons of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and likely to
prove a great captain of his people when his time came but we have had no word
of this grief out of gondor when did he fall
it is now the fourth day since he was slain answered aragorn and since
the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of tol brandir
on foot cried éomer
yes even as you see us
wide wonder came into éomers eyes strider is too poor a name son
of arathorn he said wingfoot i name you this deed of the three
friends should be sung in many a hall forty leagues and five you have measured
ere the fourth day is ended hardy is the race of elendil
but now lord what would you have me do i must return in haste to théoden
i spoke warily before my men it is true that we are not yet at open war
with the black land and there are some close to the kings ear that speak
craven counsels but war is coming we shall not forsake our old alliance with
gondor and while they fight we shall aid them: so say i and all who hold with
me the east-mark is my charge the ward of the third marshal and i have
removed all our herds and herdfolk withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving
none here but guards and swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not and we never have said éomer with a flash of his eyes
though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told some years ago the lord
of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use then he sent plundering orcs and
they carry off what they can choosing always the black horses: few of these are
now left for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concern is with saruman he has claimed lordship
over all this land and there has been war between us for many months he has
taken orcs into his service and wolf-riders and evil men and he has closed
the gap against us so that we are likely to be beset both east and west
it is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and
dwimmer-crafty having many guises he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall his spies slip
through every net and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky i do not
know how it will all end and my heart misgives me for it seems to me that his
friends do not all dwell in isengard but if you come to the kings house you
shall see for yourself will you not come do i hope in vain that you have been
sent to me for a help in doubt and need
i will come when i may said aragorn
come now said éomer the heir of elendil would be a strength
indeed to the sons of eorl in this evil tide there is battle even now
upon the westemnet and i fear that it may go ill for us
indeed in this riding north i went without the kings leave for in my
absence his house is left with little guard but scouts warned me of the
orc-host coming down out of the east wall three nights ago and among them they
reported that some bore the white badges of saruman so suspecting what i most
fear a league between orthanc and the dark tower i led forth my éored
men of my own household and we overtook the orcs at nightfall two days ago
near to the borders of the entwood there we surrounded them and gave battle
yesterday at dawn fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas for the
orcs were greater in number than we counted on others joined them coming out
of the east across the great river: their trail is plain to see a little north
of this spot and others too came out of the forest great orcs who also bore
the white hand of isengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all others
nonetheless we put an end to them but we have been too long away we are
needed south and west will you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do yes and we could find a use for gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of
the wood i spoke only as do all men in my land and i would gladly learn
better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn and my heart desires to
come with you but i cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said éomer you will not find your friends on
the north-borders
yet my friends are not behind we found a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there but between the wall and
the downs we have found no other trace of them and no trail has turned aside
this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become of them
i do not know they may have been slain and burned among the orcs but that
you will say cannot be and i do not fear it i can only think that they were
carried off into the forest before the battle even before you encircled your
foes maybe can you swear that none escaped your net in such a way
i would swear that no orc escaped after we
sighted them said éomer we reached the forest-eaves before them and
if after that any living thing broke through our ring then it was no orc and
had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said aragorn and you passed us
by under the full light of day
i had forgotten that said éomer it is hard to be sure of anything
among so many marvels the world is all grown strange elf and dwarf in company
walk in our daily fields and folk speak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword comes back to war that was broken in the long ages ere
the fathers of our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man judge what to do
in such times
as he ever has judged said aragorn good and ill have not changed since
yesteryear nor are they one thing among elves and dwarves µ and another among
men it is a mans part to discern them as much in the golden wood as in his
own house
true indeed said éomer but i do not doubt you nor the deed which
my heart would do yet i am not free to do all as i would it is against
our law to let strangers wander at will in our land until the king himself
shall give them leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril i
have begged you to come back willingly with me and you will not loth am i to
begin a battle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for such a chance said aragorn nor
indeed am i a stranger for i have been in this land before more than once and
ridden with the host of the rohirrim though under
other name and in other guise you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have spoken with éomund your father and with théoden son of
thengel never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained
a man to abandon such a quest as mine my duty at least is clear to go on come
now son of éomund the choice must be made at last aid us or at the
worst let us go free or seek to carry out your law if you do so there will be
fewer to return to your war or to your king
éomer was silent for a moment then he spoke we both have need of
haste he said my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your
hope this is my choice you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask: when your quest is achieved or is proved vain return with the
horses over the entwade to meduseld the high house in edoras where théoden
now sits thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged in this i place
myself and maybe my very life in the keeping of your good faith do not
fail
i will not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances among his men
when éomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the
strangers but only éothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the race of gondor as he claims he
said but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a dwarf
no one said gimli and do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it i
would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great free or
begrudged
but you must ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legolas then all will be
well and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark-grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it hasufel
is his name said éomer may he bear you well and to better fortune
than gárulf his late master
a smaller and lighter horse but restive and fiery was brought to legolas
arod was his name but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein i need
them not he said and leaped lightly up and to their wonder arod was tame and
willing beneath him moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the
elvish way with all good beasts gimli was lifted up behind his friend and he
clung to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek cried éomer return with
what speed you may and let our swords hereafter shine together
i will come said aragorn
and i will come too said gimli the matter of the lady galadriel lies
still between us i have yet to teach you gentle speech 
we shall see said éomer so many strange things have chanced that
to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarfs
axe will seem no great wonder farewell
with that they parted very swift were the horses of rohan when after a
little gimli looked back the company of éomer were already small and far
away aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on their
way bending low with his head beside the neck of hasufel before long they came
to the borders of the entwash and there they met the other trail of which
éomer had spoken coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into the
saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keeping to one side and taking
care not to override the footprints then he again dismounted and examined the
ground going backwards and forwards on foot
there is little to discover he said when he returned the main trail is
all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back their outward
course must have lain nearer the river but this eastward trail is fresh and
clear there is no sign there of any feet going the other way back towards
anduin now we must ride slower and make sure that no trace or footstep
branches off on either side the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were pursued they may have made some attempt to get their captives away
before they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast low grey clouds came over the
wold a mist shrouded the sun ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of fangorn
loomed slowly darkling as the sun went west they saw no sign of any trail to
right or left but here and there they passed single orcs fallen in their
tracks as they ran with grey-feathered arrows sticking in back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest and
in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great
burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking beside it was a great pile of
helms and mail cloven shields and broken swords bows and darts and other gear
of war upon a stake in the middle was set a great goblin head upon its
shattered helm the white badge could still be seen further away not far from
the river where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a
mound it was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves:
about it were planted fifteen spears
aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle
but the light faded and evening soon drew down dim and misty by nightfall
they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly we have been set many riddles since
we came to tol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel i would guess that
the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs it will be hard
news for frodo if he lives to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who
waits in rivendell elrond was against their coming
but gandalf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the first to be lost 
answered gimli his foresight failed him
the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety for
himself or for others said aragorn there are some things that it is better
to begin than to refuse even though the end may be dark but i shall not depart
from this place yet in any case we must here await the morning-light
a little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading
tree: it looked like a chestnut and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves
of a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers they rattled
mournfully in the night-breeze
gimli shivered they had brought only one blanket apiece let us light a
fire he said i care no longer for the danger let the orcs come as thick as
summer-moths round a candle
if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods it might draw them
hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn we
are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman also we are on the very
edge of fangorn and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood it is
said
but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday said gimli and they
felled trees for the fire as can be seen yet they passed the night after
safely here when their labour was ended
they were many said aragorn and they do not heed the wrath of fangorn
for they come here seldom and they do not go under the trees but our paths are
likely to lead us into the very forest itself so have a care cut no living
wood
there is no need said gimli the riders have left chip and bough enough
and there is dead wood lying in plenty he went off to gather fuel and busied
himself with building and kindling a fire but aragorn sat silent with his back
to the great tree deep in thought and legolas stood alone in the open looking
towards the profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who listens to
voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going the three companions drew
close to it and sat together shrouding the light with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look he said the tree is glad of the fire
it may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so
as to come above the flames while the upper branches were stooping down the
brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like many cold cracked
hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown forest so near at
hand made itself felt as a great brooding presence full of secret purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he said do you know why
aragorn what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard
i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i should deem them only fables that men have
made as true knowledge fades i had thought of asking you what was the truth of
the matter and if an elf of the wood does not know how shall a man answer
you have journeyed further than i said legolas i have heard nothing of
this in my own land save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men call
ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old old even as the elves would
reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as old as the forest by the barrow-downs
and it is far greater elrond says that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the mighty woods of the elder days in which the firstborn roamed while men
still slept yet fangorn holds some secret of its own what it is i do not
know
and i do not wish to know said gimli let nothing that dwells in fangorn
be troubled on my account
they now drew lots for the watches and the lot for the first watch fell to
gimli the others lay down almost at once sleep laid hold on them gimli
said aragorn drowsily remember it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a
living tree in fangorn but do not stray far in search of dead wood let the
fire die rather call me at need
with that he fell asleep legolas already lay motionless his fair hands
folded upon his breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb
thoughtfully along the edge of his axe the tree rustled there was no other
sound
suddenly gimli looked up and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood
an old bent man leaning on a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his
wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes gimli sprang up too amazed for
the moment to cry out though at once the thought flashed into his mind that
saruman had caught them both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden
movement sat up and stared the old man did not speak or make sign
well father what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode forward but the old man was
gone there was no trace of him to be found near at hand and they did not dare
to wander far the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry the horses the horses
the horses were gone they had dragged their pickets and disappeared for me
time the three companions stood still and silent troubled by this new stroke of
ill fortune they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless leagues lay
between them and the men of rohan their only friends in this wide and dangerous
land as they stood it seemed to them that they heard far off in the night
the sound of horses whinnying and neighing then all was quiet again except for
the cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last we cannot find them or catch
them so that if they do not return of their own will we must do without we
started on our feet and we have those still
feet said gimli but we cannot eat them as well as walk on them  he
threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of rohan laughed
legolas you will make a rider yet
it seems unlikely that i shall have the chance said gimli
if you wish to know what i think he began again after a while i think it
was saruman who else remember the words of éomer: he walks about like
an old man hooded and cloaked those were the words he has gone off with our
horses or scared them away and here we are there is more trouble
coming to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn but i marked also that this old man had a hat
not a hood still i do not doubt that you guess right and that we are in peril
here by night or day yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but
rest while we may i will watch for a while now gimli i have more need of
thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly legolas followed aragorn and gimli followed
legolas and their watches wore away but nothing happened the old man did not
appear again and the horses did not return
 
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own
small voice echoing in black tunnels calling frodo frodo but instead
of frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side where was merry
he woke cold air blew on his face he was lying on his back evening was
coming and the sky above was growing dim he turned and found that the dream was
little worse than the waking his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords
beside him merry lay white-faced with a dirty rag bound across his brows all
about them sat or stood a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became
separated from dream-shadows of course: he and merry had run off into the
woods what had come over them why had they dashed off like that taking no
notice of old strider they had run a long way shouting--he could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of
orcs: they were standing listening and they did not appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almost in their arms then they yelled and dozens of
other goblins had sprung out of the trees merry and he had drawn their swords
but the orcs did not wish to fight and had tried only to lay hold of them even
when merry had cut off several of their arms and hands good old merry
then boromir had come leaping through the trees he had made them fight he
slew many of them and the rest fled but they had not gone far on the way back
when they were attacked again by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrows: always at boromir boromir had blown his
great horn till the woods rang and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had
drawn back but when no answer but the echoes came they had attacked more
fierce than ever pippin did not remember much more his last memo was of
boromir leaning against a tree plucking out an arrow then darkness fell
suddenly
i suppose i was knocked on the head he said to himself i wonder if poor
merry is much hurt what has happened to boromir why didnt the orcs kill us
where are we and where are we going
he could not answer the questions he felt cold and sick i wish gandalf had
never persuaded elrond to let us come he thought what good have i been just
a nuisance: a passenger a piece of luggage and now i have been stolen and i am
just a piece of luggage for the orcs i hope strider or someone will come and
claim us but ought i to hope for it wont that throw out all the plans i wish
i could get free
he struggled a little quite uselessly one of the orcs sitting near laughed
and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue rest while you
can little fool he said then to pippin in the common speech which he made
almost as hideous as his own language rest while you can well find a use for
your legs before long youll wish you had got none before we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were dead now said the other id make
you squeak you miserable rat he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs
close to his face he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hissed dont draw attention to
yourself or i may forget my orders curse the isengarders uglúk
u bagronk sha pushdug saruman-glob búbhosh skai: he passed
into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering
and snarling
terrified pippin lay still though the pain at his wrists and ankles was
growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back to take his mind
off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear there were many
voices round about and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and
anger it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting
hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of
the orcs were using ordinary language apparently the members of two or three
quite different tribes were present and they could not understand one anothers
orc-speech there was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: which
way they were to take and what should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill them properly said one no time for play on this
trip
that cant be helped said another but why not kill them quick kill them
now theyre a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry evenings coming on and
we ought to get a move on
orders said a third voice in a deep growl kill all but not the
halfings they are to be brought back alive as quickly as possible
thats my orders
what are they wanted for asked several voices why alive do they give
good sport
no i heard that one of them has got something something thats wanted for
the war some elvish plot or other anyway theyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search them and find out we might find
something that we could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remark sneered a voice softer than the others
but more evil i may have to report that the prisoners are not to be searched
or plundered: those are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice alive and as captured no spoiling thats
my orders
not our orders said one of the earlier voices we have come all the way
from the mines to kill and avenge our folk i wish to kill and then go back
north
then you can wish again said the growling voice i am uglúk i
command i return to isengard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the great eye said the evil voice
we should go back at once to lugbúrz
if we could cross the great river we might said another voice but there
are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice a winged nazgûl awaits us
northward on the east-bank
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners and get all the pay
and praise in lugbúrz and leave us to foot it as best we can through the
horse-country no we must stick together these lands are dangerous: full of
foul rebels and brigands
aye we must stick together growled uglúk i dont trust you
little swine youve no guts outside your own sties but for us youd all have
run away we are the fighting uruk-hai we slew the great warrior we took the
prisoners we are the servants of saruman the wise the white hand: the hand
that gives us mans-flesh to eat we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose i am uglúk i have spoken
you have spoken more than enough uglúk sneered the evil voice i
wonder how they would like it in lugbúrz they might think that uglúks
shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head they might ask where his strange
ideas came from did they come from saruman perhaps who does he
think he is setting up on his own with his filthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnákh their trusted
messenger and i grishnákh say this: saruman is a fool and a dirty
treacherous fool but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being called swine by the
muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard its orc-flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc-speech answered him and the ringing clash of weapons
being drawn cautiously pippin rolled over hoping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to join in the fray in the twilight he saw a large black
orc probably uglúk standing facing grishnákh a short
crook-legged creature very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the
ground round them were many smaller goblins pippin supposed that these were
the ones from the north they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated
to attack uglúk
uglúk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly his own size ran
up then suddenly without warning uglúk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents grishnákh stepped
aside and vanished into the shadows the others gave way and one stepped
backwards and fell over merrys prostrate form with a curse yet that probably
saved his life for uglúks followers leaped over him and cut down
another with their broad-bladed swords it was the yellow-fanged guard his body
fell right on top of pippin still clutching its long saw-edged knife
put up your weapons shouted uglúk and lets have no more
nonsense we go straight west from here and down the stair from there straight
to the downs then along the river to the forest and we march day and night
that clear
now thought pippin if only it takes that ugly fellow a little while to
get his troop under control ive got a chance a gleam of hope had come to
him the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm and then slid down to his
wrist he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but he also felt the cold
touch of steel against his skin
the orcs were getting ready to march again but some of the northerners were
still unwilling and the isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing and confusion for the moment pippin was unwatched his
legs were securely bound but his arms were only tied about the wrists and his
hands were in front of him he could move them both together though the bonds
were cruelly tight he pushed the dead orc to one side then hardly daring to
breathe he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and down against the blade of the
knife it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast the cord was cut quickly
pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two
loops and slipped it over his hands then he lay very still
pick up those prisoners shouted uglúk dont play any tricks with
them if they are not alive when we get back someone else will die too
an orc seized pippin like a sack put its head between his tied hands
grabbed his arms and dragged them down until pippins face was crushed against
its neck then it jolted off with him another treated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again it was early night but
the slim moon was already falling westward they were on the edge of a cliff
that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist there was a sound of water
falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discover growled the voice of uglúk
only a single horseman and he made off westwards alls clear now
now i daresay but how long you fools you should have shot him hell
raise the alarm the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning now well
have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pippin it was uglúk sit up said the orc my
lads are tired of lugging you about we have got to climb down and you
must use your legs be helpful now no crying out no trying to escape we have
ways of paying for tricks that you wont like though they wont spoil your
usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles picked him up
by his hair and stood him on his feet pippin fell down and uglúk
dragged him up by his hair again several orcs laughed uglúk thrust a
flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt
a hot fierce glow flow through him the pain in his legs and ankles
vanished he could stand
now for the other said uglúk pippin saw him go to merry who was
lying close by and kick him merry groaned seizing him roughly uglúk
pulled him into a sitting position and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box merry
cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted cant take his medicine they jeered doesnt
know whats good for him ai we shall have some fun later
but at the moment uglúk was not engaged in sport he needed speed and
had to humour unwilling followers he was healing merry in orc-fashion and his
treatment worked swiftly when he had forced a drink from his flask down the
hobbits throat cut his leg-bonds and dragged him to his feet merry
stood up looking pale but grim and defiant and very much alive the gash in
his forehead gave him no more trouble but he bore a brown scar to the end of
his days
hullo pippin he said so youve come on this little expedition too
where do we get bed and breakfast
now then said uglúk none of that hold your tongues no talk to
one another any trouble will be reported at the other end and hell know how
to pay you youll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can
stomach
the orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty
plain below merry and pippin separated by a dozen orcs or more climbed down
with them at the bottom they stepped on to grass and the hearts of the hobbits
rose
now straight on shouted uglúk west and a little north follow
lugdush
but what are we going to do at sunrise said some of the northerners
go on running said uglúk what do you think sit on the grass and
wait for the whiteskins to join the picnic
but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you said uglúk run or youll never see
your beloved holes again by the white hand whats the use of sending out
mountain-maggots on a trip only half trained run curse you run while
night lasts
then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very
great each hobbit had a guard of three pippin was far back in the line he
wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food
since the morning one of his guards had a whip but at present the orc-liquor
was still hot in him his wits too were wide-awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen
face of strider bending over a dark trail and running running behind but what
could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc-feet his own little
prints and merrys were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes
before them and behind them and about them
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into
a wide shallow depression where the ground was soft and wet mist lay there
pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon the dark shapes of the orcs
in front grew dim and then were swallowed up
ai steady now shouted uglúk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at once he
swerved aside to the right and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard
headfirst into the mist he landed sprawling on the grass
halt yelled uglúk
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion pippin sprang up and ran but
the orcs were after him some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin but there is a hope that i have left
some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground he groped with his two tied
hands at his throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak just as long arms
and hard claws seized him he let it fall there i suppose it will lie until
the end of time he thought i dont know why i did it if the others have
escaped theyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip-thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted uglúk running up hes
still got to run a long way yet make em both run just use the whip as a
reminder
but thats not all he snarled turning to pippin i shant forget
payment is only put off leg it
neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the later part of the journey
evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery with hope
growing ever fainter behind they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly
handled if they halted or stumbled they were seized and dragged for some
distance
the warmth of the orc-draught had gone pippin felt cold and sick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the turf hard hands with rending nails
gripped and lifted him he was carried like a sack once more and darkness grew
about him: whether the darkness of another night or a blindness of his eyes he
could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the orcs
were demanding a halt uglúk was shouting he felt himself flung to the
ground and he lay as he fell till black dreams took him but he did not long
escape from pain soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again for a
long time he was tossed and shaken and then slowly the darkness gave
way and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning orders
were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair his head swam but from the
heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught an orc
stooped over him and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh he
ate the stale grey bread hungrily but not the meat he was famished but not yet
so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh of he dared not
guess what creature
he sat up and looked about merry was not far away they were by the banks of
a swift narrow river ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was catching the first
rays of the sun a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs a quarrel seemed on the
point of breaking out again between the northerners and the isengarders some
were pointing back away south and some were pointing eastward
very well said uglúk leave them to me then no killing as ive
told you before but if you want to throw away what weve come all the way to
get throw it away ill look after it let the fighting uruk-hai do the work
as usual if youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing ahead get to it its your best hope off you
go and quick before i knock a few more heads off to put some sense into the
others
there was some cursing and scuffling and then most of the northerners broke
away and dashed off over a hundred of them running wildly along the river
towards the mountains the hobbits were left with the isengarders: a grim dark
band four score at least of large swart slant-eyed orcs with great bows and
short broad-bladed swords a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained
with them
now well deal with grishnákh said uglúk but some even of
his own followers were looking uneasily southwards
i know growled uglúk the cursed horse-boys have got wind
of us but thats all your fault snaga you and the other scouts ought to have
your ears cut off but we are the fighters well feast on horseflesh yet or
something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the troop
had been pointing eastward from that direction there now came hoarse cries and
there was grishnákh again and at his back a couple of score of others
like him: long-armed crook-legged orcs they had a red eye painted on their
shields uglúk stepped forward to meet them so youve come
back he said thought better of it eh
ive returned to see that orders are carried out and the prisoners safe
answered grishnákh
indeed said uglúk waste of effort ill see that orders are
carried out in my command and what else did you come back for you went
in a hurry did you leave anything behind
i left a fool snarled grishnákh but there were some stout fellows
with him that are too good to lose i knew youd lead them into a mess ive
come to help them
splendid laughed uglúk but unless youve got some guts for
fighting youve taken the wrong way lugbúrz was your road the
whiteskins are coming whats happened to your precious nazgûl has he had
another mount shot under him now if youd brought him along that might have
been useful-if these nazgûl are all they make out
nazgûl nazgûl
said grishnákh shivering and licking his lips as if the word had a foul
taste that he savoured painfully you speak of what is deep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams uglúk he said nazgûl ah all that
they make out one day youll wish that you had not said that ape he snarled
fiercely you ought to know that theyre the apple of the great eye but the
winged nazgûl: not yet not yet he wont let them show themselves
across the great river yet not too soon theyre for the war-and other
purposes
you seem to know a lot said uglúk more than is good for you i
guess perhaps those in lugbúrz might wonder how and why but in the
meantime the uruk-hai of isengard can do the dirty work as usual dont stand
slavering there get your rabble together the other swine are legging it to the
forest youd better follow you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs
then the troop started off hour after hour they ran pausing now and again only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers either because they were quicker
and hardier or because of some plan of grishnákhs the isengarders
gradually passed through the orcs of mordor and grishnákhs folk closed
in behind soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead the forest
began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated by the filthy jowl
and hairy ear of the orc that held him immediately in front were bowed backs
and tough thick legs going up and down up and down unresting as if they were
made of wire and horn beating out the nightmare seconds of an endless time
in the afternoon uglúks troop overtook the northerners they were
flagging in the rays of the bright sun winter sun shining in a pale cool sky
though it was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
maggots jeered the isengarders youre cooked the whiteskins will catch
you and eat you theyre coming
a cry from grishnákh showed that this was not mere jest horsemen
riding very swiftly had indeed been sighted: still far behind but gaining on
the orcs gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in a
quicksand
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished pippin a
terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race then he saw that the sun was
sinking falling behind the misty mountains shadows reached over the land the
soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed the forest
was dark and close already they had passed a few outlying trees the land was
beginning to slope upwards ever more steeply but
the orcs did not halt both uglúk and grishnákh shouted spurring
them on to a last effort
they will make it yet they will escape thought pippin and then he
managed to twist his neck so as to glance back with one eye over his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were already level with the orcs galloping
over the plain the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their
pale flowing hair they were hemming the orcs in preventing them from
scattering and driving them along the line of the river
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were he wished now that he had
learned more in rivendell and looked more at maps and things but in those days
the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands and he had never
reckoned with being cut off from gandalf or from strider and even from frodo
all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs horse shadowfax had
come from that land that sounded hopeful as far as it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought i dont suppose
theyve ever heard of hobbits down here i suppose i ought to be glad that the
beastly orcs look like being destroyed but i would rather be saved myself the
chances were that he and merry would be killed together with their captors
before ever the men of rohan were aware of them
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen skilled at shooting from a running
horse riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs that straggled
behind and several of them fell then the riders wheeled away out of the range
of the answering bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumbled and did not get up again
night came down without the riders closing in for battle many orcs had
fallen but fully two hundred remained in the early darkness the orcs came to a
hillock the eaves of the forest were very near probably
no more than three furlongs away but they could go no further the horsemen had
encircled them a small band disobeyed uglúks command and ran on
towards the forest: only three returned
well here we are sneered grishnákh fine leadership i hope the
great uglúk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered uglúk taking no notice of grishnákh
you lugdush get two others and stand guard over them theyre not to be
killed unless the filthy whiteskins break through understand as long
as im alive i want em but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be
rescued bind their legs
the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly but pippin found that
for the first time he was close to merry the orcs were making a great deal of
noise shouting and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper
together for a while
i dont think much of this said merry i feel nearly done in dont think
i could crawl away far even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin lembas: ive got some have you i
dont think theyve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered merry but it must be battered
to crumbs anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket
you wont have to ive- but just then a savage kick warned pippin that
the noise had died down and the guards were watchful
the night was cold and still all round the knoll on which the orcs were
gathered little watch-fires sprang up golden-red in the darkness a complete
ring of them they were within a long bowshot but
the riders did not show themselves against the light and the orcs wasted many
arrows shooting at the fires until uglúk stopped them the riders made
no sound later in the night when the moon came out of the mist then
occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in
the white light as they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the guards why dont
we get together and charge through whats old uglúk
think hes doing i should like to know
i daresay you would snarled uglúk stepping up from behind meaning
i dont think at all eh curse you youre as bad as the other rabble: the
maggots and the apes of lugbúrz no good trying to charge with
them theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more than enough of these
filthy horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets in
the dark but these whiteskins have better night-eyes
than most men from all ive heard and dont forget their horses they can see
the night-breeze or so its said still theres one thing the fine fellows
dont know: mauhúr and his lads are in the forest and they should turn
up any time now
uglúks words were enough apparently to
satisfy the isengarders but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay on the ground resting in the
pleasant darkness it did indeed become very dark again for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pippin could not see anything a few feet
away the fires brought no light to the hillock the riders were not however
content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest a sudden outcry
on the east side of the knoll showed that something
was wrong it seemed that some of the men had ridden in close slipped off their
horses crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several orcs and then had
faded away again uglúk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up their guards isengarders had gone with uglúk
but if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed a long hairy
arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together dimly they were
aware of grishnákhs great head and hideous face between them his
foul breath was on their cheeks he began to paw them and feel them pippin
shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my little ones said grishnákh in a soft whisper enjoying
your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed perhaps: swords and
whips on one side and nasty spears on the other little people should not
meddle _in affairs that are too big for them his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught direct from the
urgent thought of his enemy: grishnákh knows about the ring hes
looking for it while uglúk is busy: he probably wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippins heart yet at the same time he was wondering what use
he could make of grishnákhs desire
i dont think you will find it that way he whispered it isnt easy to
find
find it said grishnákh: his
fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoulder find what what
are you talking about little one for a moment pippin was silent then
suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: gollum gollum
nothing my precious he added
the hobbits felt grishnákhs fingers twitch o ho hissed the
goblin softly thats what he means is it o ho very ve-ry dangerous my
little ones
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess perhaps and
not only for us still you know your own business best do you want it or not
and what would you give for it
do i want it do i want it said grishnákh as if puzzled but his
arms were trembling what would i give for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing his words carefully that its no good
groping in the dark we could save you time and trouble but you must untie our
legs first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear tender little fools hissed grishnákh everything you have
and everything you know will be got out of you in due time: everything
youll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed
you will: quite soon we shant hurry the enquiry oh dear no what do you think
youve been kept alive for my dear little fellows please believe me when i say
that it was not out of kindness: thats not even
one of uglúks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry but you havent got your prey
home yet and it doesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens if we come
to isengard it wont be the great grishnákh
that benefits: saruman will take all that he can find if you want anything for
yourself nows the time to do a deal
grishnákh began to lose his temper the name of saruman seemed
specially to enrage him time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
uglúk or the isengarders might return at any minute
have you got it - either of you he snarled
gollum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling violently curse you you filthy little
vermin he hissed untie your legs ill untie every string in your bodies do
you think i cant search you to the bones search you ill cut you both to
quivering shreds i dont need the help of your legs to get you away-and have
you all to myself
suddenly he seized them the strength in his long arms and shoulders was
terrifying he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them fiercely to
his sides a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their mouths then he
sprang forward stooping low quickly and silently he went until he came to the
edge of the knoll there choosing a gap between the watchers he passed like an
evil shadow out into the night down the slope and away westward towards the
river that flowed out of the forest in that direction there was a wide open
space with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted peering and listening nothing could be
seen or heard he crept slowly on bent almost double then he squatted and
listened again then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash at that very
moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of him a horse snorted
and reared a man called out
grishnákh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits under
him then he drew his sword no doubt he meant to kill his captives
rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing the
sword rang faintly and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to his
left an arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill
or guided by fate and it pierced his right hand he dropped the sword and
shrieked there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as grishnákh leaped
up and ran he was ridden down and a spear passed through him he gave a hideous
shivering cry and lay still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnákh had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrades aid whether because of
some special keenness of sight or because of some other sense the horse lifted
and sprang lightly over them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elven-cloaks too crushed for the moment and too afraid to
move
at last merry stirred and whispered softly: so far so good: but how are we
to avoid being spitted
the answer came almost immediately the cries of
grishnákh had roused the orcs from the yells and screeches that came
from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered:
uglúk was probably knocking off a few more heads then suddenly the
answering cries of orc-voices came from the right outside the circle of
watch-fires from the direction of the forest and the mountains mauhúr
had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers there was the sound of
galloping horses the riders were drawing in their ring close round the
knoll risking the orc-arrows so as to prevent any sortie while a company rode
off to deal with the newcomers suddenly merry and pippin realized that without
moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and
escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and hands free we might get
away but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin i was going to tell you: ive managed to free
my hands these loops are only left for show youd better have a bit of lembas
first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet the cakes were
broken but good still in their leaf-wrappings the hobbits each ate two or
three pieces the taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces and
laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away for a while they ate
thoughtfully sitting in the dark heedless of the cries and sounds of battle
nearby pippin was the first to come back to the present
we must be off he said half a moment
grishnákhs sword was lying close at hand but it was too heavy and
clumsy for him to use so he crawled forward and finding the body of the goblin
he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife with this he quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be able
to stand again and walk but in any case we had better start by crawling
they crawled the turf was deep and yielding and that helped them: but it
seemed a long slow business they gave the watch-fire a wide berth and wormed
their way forward bit by bit until they came to the edge of the river gurgling
away in the black shadows under its deep banks then they looked back
the sounds had died away evidently mauhúr and his lads had
been killed or driven off the riders had returned to their silent ominous
vigil it would not last very much longer already the night was old in the
east which had remained unclouded the sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen it will not be
any comfort to us if these riders discover that we are not orcs after we are
dead he got up and stamped his feet those cords have cut me like wires but
my feet are getting warm again i could stagger on now what about you merry
merry got up yes he said i can manage it lembas does put heart
into you a more wholesome sort of feeling too than the heat of that
orc-draught i wonder what it was made of better not to know i expect lets
get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it
not here the banks are too steep said pippin forward now
they turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river
behind them the light grew in the east as they walked they compared notes
talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their
capture no listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered
cruelly and been in dire peril going without hope towards torment and death
or that even now as they knew well they had little chance of ever finding
friend or safety again
you seem to have been doing well master took said merry you will get
almost a chapter in old bilbos book if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work: especially guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up
to him but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and find that
brooch i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i am to get level with you indeed
cousin brandybuck is going in front now this is where he comes in i dont
suppose you have much notion where we are but i spent my time at rivendell
rather better we are walking west along the entwash the butt-end of the misty
mountains is in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees creeping away from the
coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin or lead back we have been warned
against fangorn but one so knowing will not have forgotten that
i have not answered merry but the forest seems better to me all the
same than turning back into the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees old beyond guessing
they seemed great trailing beards of lichen hung from them blowing and swaying
in the breeze out of the shadows the hobbits peeped gazing back down the
slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf-children in
the deeps of time peering out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn
far over the great river and the brown lands leagues upon grey leagues
away the dawn came red as flame loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it the
riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life horn answered horn again
merry and pippin heard clear in the cold air the neighing of war-horses
and the sudden singing of many men the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire
above the margin of the world then with a great cry the riders charged from the
east the red light gleamed on mail and spear the orcs yelled and shot all the
arrows that remained to them the hobbits saw several horsemen fall but their
line held on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again most
of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled this way and that
pursued one by one to the death but one band holding together in a black
wedge drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest straight up the
slope they charged towards the watchers now they were drawing near and it
seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down three riders
that barred their way
we have watched too long said merry theres
uglúk i dont want to meet him again the hobbits turned and fled deep
into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not sec the last stand when uglúk was
overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of fangorn there he was slain at
last by éomer the third marshal of the mark who dismounted and fought
him sword to sword and over the wide fields the keen-eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their
praises the riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came ever back either to mordor or to
isengard but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many
watchful eyes
 
chapter 4
treebeard
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest
allowed following the line of the running stream westward and up towards the
slopes of the mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn slowly their fear of
the orcs died away and their pace slackened a queer stifling feeling came over
them as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing
at last merry halted we cant go on like this he panted i want some
air
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin im parched he clambered on
to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cupped hands it was clear and cold and he took many draughts
merry followed him the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts
for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream dabbling their sore
feet and legs and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them
rank upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning back against a
great tree-trunk we can at least follow the course of this stream the entwash
or whatever you call it and get out again the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said merry and if we could breathe
properly
yes it is all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin it reminds me
somehow of the old room in the great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough: a huge place where the furniture has never been moved or
changed for generations they say the old took lived in it year after year
while he and the room got older and shabbier together-and it has never changed
since he died a century ago and old gerontius was my great-great-grandfather:
that puts it back a bit but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of lichen and most of
the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen
untidy i cant imagine what spring would look like here if it ever comes
still less a spring-cleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes said merry it does not
look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood that was all dark and
black and the home of dark black things this is just dim and frightfully
tree-ish you cant imagine animals living here at all or staying for
long
no nor hobbits said pippin and i dont like the thought of trying to
get through it either nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess how
are our supplies
low said merry we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of lembas
and left everything else behind they looked at what remained of the
elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days that was all and not
a wrap or a blanket said merry we shall be cold tonight whichever way we
go
well wed better decide on the way now said pippin the morning must be
getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared some way
further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the
forest-roof
hullo said merry the sun must have run into a cloud while weve been
under these trees and now she has run out again or else she has climbed high
enough to look down through some opening it isnt far - lets go and
investigate
they found it was further than they thought the ground was rising steeply
still and it was becoming increasingly stony the light grew broader as they
went on and soon they saw that there was a rock-wall before them: the side of a
hill or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on it and the sun was falling full on its stony face the twigs
of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff and still as if reaching out
to the warmth where all had looked so shabby and grey before the wood now
gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth black-greys of bark like polished
leather the boles of the trees glowed with a soft green like young grass: early
spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them
in the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural
perhaps and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock for it was rough
and uneven high up almost level with the tops of forest-trees there was a
shelf under a cliff nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge
and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it looked almost
like the figure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the
morning-light
up we go said merry joyfully now for a breath of air and a sight of the
land
they climbed and scrambled up the rock if the stair had been made it was for
bigger feet and longer legs than theirs they were too eager to be surprised at
the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and
their vigour had returned they came at length to the edge of the shelf almost
at the feet of the old stump then they sprang up and turned round with their
backs to the hill breathing deep and looking out eastward they saw that they
had only come some three or four miles into the forest: the heads of the trees
marched down the slopes towards the plain there near the fringe of the forest
tall spires of curling black smoke went up wavering and floating towards them
the winds changing said merry its turned east again it feels cool up
here
yes said pippin im afraid this is only a passing gleam and it will all
go grey again what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in the
sunlight i almost felt i liked the place
almost felt you liked the forest thats good thats uncommonly kind of
you said a strange voice turn round and let me have a look at your faces i
almost feel that i dislike you both but do not let us be hasty turn round a
large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders and they were
twisted round gently but irresistibly then two great arms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face it belonged
to a large man-like almost troll-like figure at least fourteen foot high
very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck whether it was clad in stuff
like green and grey bark or whether that was its hide was difficult to say at
any rate the arms at a short distance from the trunk were not wrinkled but
covered with a brown smooth skin the large feet had seven toes each the lower
part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard bushy almost
twiggy at the roots thin and mossy at the ends but at the moment the hobbits
noted little but the eyes these deep eyes were now surveying them slow and
solemn but very penetrating they were brown shot with a green light often
afterwards pippin tried to describe his first impression of them
one felt as if there was an enormous well behind them filled up with ages
of memory and long slow steady thinking but their surface was sparkling with
the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree or on the
ripples of a very deep lake i dont know but it felt as if something that grew
in the ground-asleep you might say or just feeling itself as something between
roof-tip and leaf-tip between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and was
considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside
affairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured the voice a deep voice like a very deep
woodwind instrument very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto but if
i had seen you before i heard your voices - i liked them: nice little voices
they reminded me of something i cannot remember - if i had seen you before i
heard you i should have just trodden on you taking you for little orcs and
found out my mistake afterwards very odd you are indeed root and twig very
odd
pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid under those eyes he felt
a curious suspense but not fear please he said who are you and what are
you
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind of wariness the deep wells were
covered over hrum now answered the voice well i am an ent or
thats what they call me yes ent is the word the ent i am you might
say in your manner of speaking fangorn is my name according to some treebeard
others make it treebeard will do
an ent said merry whats that but what do you call yourself
whats your real name
hoo now replied treebeard hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i am doing the asking you are in my country what are you
i wonder i cannot place you you do not seem to come in the old lists that i
learned when i was young but that was a long long time ago and they may have
made new lists let me see let me see how did it go
learn now the lore of living creatures

first name the four the free peoples:

eldest of all the elf-children

dwarf the delver dark are his houses

ent the earthborn old as mountains

man the mortal master of horses:
hm hm hm
beaver the builder buck the leaper

bear bee-hunter boar the fighter

hound is hungry hare is fearful…
hm hm
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture

hart horn-crowned hawk is swiftest

swan the whitest serpent coldest…
hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum room tum roomty toom tum it
was a long list but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem to have got left out of the old lists and the old stories
said merry yet weve been about for quite a long time were hobbits
why not make a new line said pippin
half-grown hobbits the hole-dwellers
put us in amongst the four next to man the big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard that would do so you live in holes
eh it sounds very right and proper who calls you hobbits though that
does not sound elvish to me elves made all the old words: they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves hobbits but
you should not go telling just anybody youll be letting out your own right
names if youre not careful
we arent careful about that said merry as a matter of fact im a
brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck though most people call me just merry
and im a took peregrin took but im generally called pippin or even
pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard i am honoured by
your confidence but you should not be too free all at once there are ents and
ents you know or there are ents and things that look like ents but aint as
you might say ill call you merry and pippin if you please - nice names for i
am not going to tell you my name not yet at any rate a queer half-knowing
half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes for one thing it
would take a long while: my name is growing all the time and ive lived a very
long long time so my name is like a story real names tell you the
story of the things they belong to in my language in the old entish as you
might say it is a lovely language but it takes a very long time to say
anything in it because we do not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to listen to
but now and the eyes became very bright and present seeming to grow
smaller and almost sharp what is going on what are you doing in it all i can
see and hear and smell and feel a great deal from this from
this from this
a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burúmë excuse me:
that is a part of my name for it i do not know what the word is in the outside
languages: you know the thing we are on where i stand and look out on fine
mornings and think about the sun and the grass beyond the wood and the
horses and the clouds and the unfolding of the world what is going on what
is gandalf up to and these - burárum
he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a great organ - these orcs and
young saruman down at isengard i like news but not too quick now
there is quite a lot going on said merry: and even if we tried to be
quick it would take a long time to tell but you told us not to be hasty ought
we to tell you anything so soon would you think it rude if we asked what you
are going to do with us and which side you are on and did you know gandalf
yes i do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees  said
treebeard do you know him
yes said pippin sadly we did he was a great friend and he was our
guide
then i can answer your other questions said treebeard i am not going to
do anything with you: not if you mean by that do something to
you without your leave we might do some things together i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your way may go along with mine for a while but you speak
of master gandalf as if he was in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly the story seems to be going on but i am
afraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard hoom hm ah well he paused looking long
at the hobbits: hoom ah well i do not know what to say come now
if you would like to hear more said merry we will tell you but it will
take some time wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit here together
in the sun while it lasts you must be getting tired of holding us up
hm tired no i am not tired i do not easily get tired and i do
not sit down i am not very hm bendable but there the sun is going
in let us leave this - did you say what you call it
hill suggested pippin shelf step suggested merry
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully hill yes that was it
but it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of
the world was shaped never mind let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far
i do not know you might call it far perhaps but what does that matter
well you see we have lost all our belongings said merry we have only a
little food
o hm you need not trouble about that said treebeard i can give you a
drink that will keep you green and growing for a long long while and if we
decide to part company i can set you down outside my country at any point you
choose let us go
holding the hobbits gently but firmly one in the crook of each arm
treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other and moved them to
the edge of the shelf the rootlike toes grasped the rocks then carefully and
solemnly he stalked down from step to step and reached the floor of the
forest
at once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees deeper and
deeper into the wood never far from the stream climbing steadily up towards
the slopes of the mountains many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merely passed by but some quivered and some
raised up their branches above his head as he approached all the while as he
walked he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time they felt oddly enough safe and
comfortable and they had a great deal to think and wonder about at last pippin
ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask you something why did celeborn
warn us against your forest he told us not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard and i might have said much the same
if you had been going the other way do not risk getting entangled in the woods
of laurelindórenan
that is what the elves used to call it but now they make the name shorter:
lothlórien they call it perhaps they are right: maybe it is fading not
growing land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time now
it is the dreamflower ah well but it is a queer place and not for just
any one to venture in i am surprised that you ever got out but much more
surprised that you ever got in: that has not happened to strangers for many a
year it is a queer land
and so is this folk have come to grief here aye they have to grief
laurelindórenan lindelorendor malinornélion ornemalin
he hummed to himself they are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything else outside the golden
wood is what it was when celeborn was young still:
taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna tumbaletaurëa lómëanor
that is what they used to say things have changed but it is still true in
places
what do you mean said pippin what is true
the trees and the ents said treebeard i do not understand all that goes
on myself so i cannot explain it to you some of us are still true ents and
lively enough in our fashion but many are growing sleepy going tree-ish as
you might say most of the trees are just trees of course but many are half
awake some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts nothing to
do with their wood: i do not mean that why i knew some good old willows down
the entwash gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they were
falling all to pieces but as quiet and sweet-spoken as a young leaf and then
there are some trees in the valleys under the mountains sound as a bell and
bad right through that sort of thing seems to spread there used to be some
very dangerous parts in this country there are still some very black patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse i do not doubt there is some
shadow of the great darkness lying there still away north and bad memories are
handed down but there are hollow dales in this land where the darkness has
never been lifted and the trees are older than i am still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train and we teach we walk and
we weed
we are tree-herds we old ents few enough of us are left now sheep get
like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is said but slowly and neither
have long in the world it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and they
walk down the ages together for ents are more like elves: less interested in
themselves than men are and better at getting inside other things and yet
again ents are more like men more changeable than elves are and quicker at
taking the colour of the outside you might say or better than both: for they
are steadier and keep their minds on things longer some of my kin look just
like trees now and need something great to rouse them and they speak only in
whispers but some of my trees are limb-lithe and many can talk to me elves
began it of course waking trees up and teaching them to speak and learning
their tree-talk they always wished to talk to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away over the sea or fled
into far valleys and hid themselves and made songs about days that would never
come again never again aye aye there was all one wood once upon a time: from
here to the mountains of lune and this was just the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could walk and sing all day and
hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills the woods were
like the woods of lothlórien only thicker
stronger younger and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just
breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making hardly a sound with his
great feet then he began to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them:
in the willow-meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring

ah the sight and the smell of the spring in nan-tasarion

and i said that was good

i wandered in summer in the elm-woods of ossiriand

ah the light and the music in the summer by the seven rivers of ossir

and i thought that was best

to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn

ah the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the autumn in
taur-na-neldor

it was more than my desire

to the pine-trees upon the highland of dorthonion i climbed in the winter

ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of winter upon
orod-na-thôn

my voice went up and sang in the sky

and now all those lands lie under the wave

and i walk in ambaróna in tauremorna in aldalómë

in my own land in the country of fangorn

where the roots are long

and the years lie thicker than the leaves

in tauremornalómë
he ended and strode on silently and in all the wood as far as ear could
reach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees at last the
hobbits saw rising dimly before them a steep dark land: they had come to the
feet of the mountains and to the green roots of tall methedras down the
hillside the young entwash leaping from its springs high above ran noisily
from step to step to meet them on the right of the stream there was a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight no trees grew there and it was
open to the sky stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace suddenly before
them the hobbits saw a wide opening two great trees stood there one on either
side like living gate-posts but there was no gate save their crossing and
interwoven boughs as the old ent approached the trees lifted up their
branches and all their leaves quivered and rustled for they were evergreen
trees and their leaves were dark and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space as though the floor of a great hall had been
cut in the side of the hill on either hand the walls sloped upwards until they
were fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that
also increased in height as they marched inwards
at the far end the rock-wall was sheer but at the bottom it had been
hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the hall
save the branches of the trees which at the inner end overshadowed all the
ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle a little stream escaped
from the springs above and leaving the main water fell tinkling down the sheer
face of the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain in front of the
arched bay the water was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between
the trees and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path out to
rejoin the entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treebeard breaking his long silence i have brought
you about seventy thousand ent-strides but what that comes to in the
measurement of your land i do not know anyhow we are near the roots of the last
mountain part of the name of this place might be wellinghall if it were turned
into your language i like it we will stay here tonight he set them down on
the grass between the aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the
great arch the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent but
his legs opened in a great stride he planted his big toes and they were indeed
big and very broad on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring and took a
deep breath then he laughed and passed inside a great stone table stood
there but no chairs at the back of the bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table they seemed to
be filled with water but he held his hands over them and immediately they
began to glow one with a golden and the other with a rich green light and the
blending of the two lights lit the bay as if the sun of summer was shining
through a roof of young leaves looking back the hobbits saw that the trees in
the court had also begun to glow faintly at first but steadily quickening
until every leaf was edged with light: some green some gold some red as
copper while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard you are thirsty i
expect perhaps you are also tired drink this he went to the back of the bay
and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there with heavy lids he
removed one of the lids and dipped in a great ladle and with it filled three
bowls one very large bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent-house he said and there are no seats i fear but you may
sit on the table picking up the hobbits he set them on the great stone slab
six feet above the ground and there they sat dangling their legs and drinking
in sips
the drink was like water indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had
drunk from the entwash near the borders of the forest and yet there was some
scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was faint but it
reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at
night the effect of the draught began at the toes and rose steadily through
every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards right to the
tips of the hair indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads was
actually standing up waving and curling and growing as for treebeard he first
laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch and then he drained his bowl at one
draught one long slow draught the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl down again ah - ah he sighed hm hoom now we
can talk easier you can sit on the floor and i will lie down that will
prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep
on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs not more than
a couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken treebeard
lowered himself slowly on to this with only the slightest sign of bending at
his middle until he lay at full length with his arms behind his head looking
up at the ceiling upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in
the sunshine merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they
left hobbiton they followed no very clear order for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often stopped the speaker and went back to
some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about later events they
said nothing whatever about the ring and did not tell him why they set out or
where they were going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interested in everything: in
the black riders in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom bombadil
in the mines of moria and in lothlórien and galadriel he made them
describe the shire and its country over and over again he said an odd
thing at this point you never see any hm any ents round there do you he
asked well not ents entwives i should really say
entwives said pippin are they like you at all
yes hm well no: i do not really know now said treebeard thoughtfully
but they would like your country so i just wondered
treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all in sarumans doings the hobbits regretted
very much that they knew so little about them: only
a rather vague report by sam of what gandalf had told the council but they were
clear at any rate that uglúk and his troop came from isengard and spoke
of saruman as their master
hm hoom said treebeard when at last their story had wound and wandered
down to the battle of the orcs and the riders of rohan well well that is a
bundle of news and no mistake you have not told me all no indeed not by a
long way but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish there is
something very big going on that i can see and what it is maybe i shall learn
in good time or in bad time by root and twig but it is a strange business: up
sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists and behold the nine
forgotten riders reappear to hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great
journey and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs pursue them
down all the leagues of wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great
storm i hope they weather it
and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars said treebeard they
mostly concern elves and men that is the business of wizards: wizards are
always troubled about the future i do not like worrying about the future i am
not altogether on anybodys side because nobody is altogether on my side
if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as i care for them not even
elves nowadays still i take more kindly to elves than to others: it was the
elves that cured us of dumbness long ago and that was a great gift that cannot
be forgotten though our ways have parted since and there are some things of
course whose side i am altogether not on i
am against them altogether: these - burárum he again made a deep rumble
of disgust - these orcs and their masters
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on mirkwood but when it removed to
mordor i did not trouble for a while: mordor is a long way away but it seems
that the wind is setting east and the withering of all woods may be drawing
near there is naught that an old ent can do to hold back that storm: he must
weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighbour: i cannot overlook him i must do
something i suppose i have often wondered lately what i should do about
saruman
who is saruman asked pippin do you know anything about his history
saruman is a wizard answered treebeard more than that i cannot say i do
not know the history of wizards they appeared first after the great ships came
over the sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell saruman was
reckoned great among them i believe he gave up wandering about and minding the
affairs of men and elves some time ago - you would call it a very long time
ago: and he settled down at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow he was chosen to be
head of the white council they say but that did not turn out too well i
wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways but at any rate he
used to give no trouble to his neighbours i used to talk to him there was a
time when he was always walking about my woods he was polite in those days
always asking my leave at least when he met me and always eager to listen i
told him many things that he would never have found out by himself but he never
repaid me in like kind i cannot remember that he ever told me anything and he
got more and more like that his face as i remember it - i have not seen it for
many a day - became like windows in a stone wall: windows with shutters inside
i think that i now understand what he is up to he is plotting to become a
power he has a mind of metal and wheels and he does not care for growing
things except as far as they serve him for the moment and now it is clear that
he is a black traitor he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs brm hoom
worse than that: he has been doing something to them something dangerous for
these isengarders are more like wicked men it is a mark of evil things that
came in the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but sarumans orcs
can endure it even if they hate it i wonder what he has done are they men he
has ruined or has he blended the races of orcs and men that would be a black
evil
treebeard rumbled for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep
subterranean entish malediction some time ago i began to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on only lately did i guess that
saruman was to blame and that long ago he had been spying out all the ways and
discovering my secrets he and his foul folk are making havoc now down on the
borders they are felling trees-good trees some of the trees they just cut down
and leave to rot - orc-mischief that but most are hewn up and carried off to
feed the fires of orthanc there is always a smoke rising from isengard these
days
curse him root and branch many of those trees were my friends creatures i
had known from nut and acorn many had voices of their own that are lost for
ever now and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were
singing groves i have been idle i have let things slip it must stop
treebeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk stood up and thumped his
hand on the table the vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes and his beard stood out stiff
as a great besom
i will stop it he boomed and you shall come with me you may be able to
help me you will be helping your own friends that way too for if saruman is
not checked rohan and gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front our
roads go together - to isengard
we will come with you said merry we will do what we can
yes said pippin i should like to see the white hand overthrown i should
like to be there even if i could not be of much use: i shall never forget uglúk
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard but i spoke hastily we must not be hasty i
have become too hot i must cool myself and think fur it is easier to shout stop
than to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain of
the spring then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops of water
fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again he seemed to be
counting on his fingers fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed the
trouble is that there are so few of us left he said turning towards the
hobbits only three remain of the first ents that walked in the woods before
the darkness: only myself fangorn and finglas and fladrif - to give them their
elvish names you may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for this business
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree-ish you might say: he has taken to
standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of
the meadows round his knees covered with leafy hair he is he used to rouse up
in winter but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then skinbark
lived on the mountain-slopes west of isengard that is where the worst trouble
has been he was wounded by the orcs and many of his folk and his tree-herds
have been murdered and destroyed he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down still i daresay i could
get together a fair company of our younger folks - if i could make them
understand the need: if i could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk what a pity
there are so few of us
why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long asked
pippin have a great many died
oh no said treebeard none have died from inside as you might say some
have fallen in the evil chances of the long years of course: and more have
grown tree-ish but there were never many of us and we have not increased there
have been no entings - no children you would say not for a terrible long count
of years you see we lost the entwives
how very sad said pippin how was it that they all died
they did not die said treebeard i never said died we lost
them i said we lost them and we cannot find them he sighed i thought most
folk knew that there were songs about the hunt of the ents for the entwives
sung among elves and men from mirkwood to gondor they cannot be quite
forgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come west over the mountains to the
shire said merry wont you tell us some more or sing us one of the songs
yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request but
i cannot tell it properly only in short and then we must end our talk:
tomorrow we have councils to call and work to do and maybe a journey to
begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he went on after a pause when the
world was young and the woods were wide and wild the ents and the entwives -
and there were entmaidens then: ah the loveliness of fimbrethil of wandlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our youth - they walked together and they
housed together but our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the ents
gave their love to things that they met in the world and the entwives gave
their thought to other things for the ents loved the great trees and the wild
woods and the slopes of the high hills and they drank of the mountain-streams
and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path and they learned of
the elves and spoke with the trees but the entwives gave their minds to the
lesser trees and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests
and they saw the sloe in the thicket and the wild apple and the cherry
blossoming in spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer and the
seeding grasses in the autumn fields they did not desire to speak with these
things but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them the
entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes and bear leaf and fruit
to their liking for the entwives desired order and plenty and peace by which
they meant that things should remain where they had set them so the entwives
made gardens to live in but we ents went on wandering and we only came to the
gardens now and again then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crossed the great river and made new gardens and tilled new fields and we saw
them more seldom after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwives
blossomed richly and their fields were full of corn many men learned the
crafts of the entwives and honoured them greatly but we were only a legend to
them a secret in the heart of the forest yet here we still are while all the
gardens of the entwives are wasted: men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago - in the time of the war between sauron and the
men of the sea - desire came over me to see fimbrethil again very fair she was
still in my eyes when i had last seen her though little like the entmaiden of
old for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour their hair parched
by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples yet their
eyes were still the eyes of our own people we crossed over anduin and came to
their land: but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted for war had
passed over it but the entwives were not there long we called and long we
searched and we asked all folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and some said that they had seen them
walking away west and some said east and others south but nowhere that we
went could we find them our sorrow was very great yet the wild wood called
and we returned to it for many years we used to go out every now and again and
look for the entwives walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful
names but as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far and now the
entwives are only a memory for us and our beards are long and grey the elves
made many songs concerning the search of the ents and some of the songs passed
into the tongues of men but we made no songs about it being content to chant
their beautiful names when we thought of the entwives we believe that we may
meet again in a time to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where
we can live together and both be content but it is foreboded that that will
only be when we have both lost all that we now have and it may well be that
that time is drawing near at last for if sauron of old destroyed the gardens
the enemy today seems likely to wither all the woods
there was an elvish song that spoke of this or at least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and down the great river it was never an entish song
mark you: it would have been a very long song in entish but we know it by
heart and hum it now and again this is how it runs in your tongue:
ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is in the bough when
light is on the wild-wood stream and wind is on the brow when stride is
long and breath is deep and keen the mountain-air come back to me come
back to me and say my land is fair
entwife
when spring is come to garth and field and corn is in the blade when
blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid when shower and sun
upon the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here and will not
come because my land is fair
ent
when summer lies upon the world and in a noon of gold beneath the roof
of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold when woodland halls are
green and cool and wind is in the west come back to me come back to me
and say my land is best
entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown when
straw is gold and ear is white and harvest comes to town when honey
spills and apple swells though wind be in the west ill linger here
beneath the sun because my land is best
ent
when winter comes the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay when
trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day when wind is
in the deadly east then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and call
to thee ill come to thee again
entwife
when winter comes and singing ends when darkness falls at last when
broken is the barren bough and light and labour past ill look for thee
and wait for thee until we meet again: together we will take the road
beneath the bitter rain
both
together we will take the road that leads into the west and far away
will find a land where both our hearts may rest
treebeard ended his song that is how it goes he said it is elvish of
course: lighthearted quickworded and soon over i daresay it is fair enough
but the ents could say more on their side if they had time but now i am going
to stand up and take a little sleep where will you stand
we usually lie down to sleep said merry we shall be all right where we
are
lie down to sleep said treebeard why of course you do hm hoom: i was
forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times almost thought that i
was talking to young entings i did well you can lie on the bed i am going to
stand in the rain good night
merry and pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and
fern it was fresh and sweet-scented and warm the lights died down and the
glow of the trees faded but outside under the arch they could see old treebeard
standing motionless with his arms raised above his head the bright stars
peered out of the sky and lit the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court and on to the
floor of the bay shreds of high cloud were overhead running on a stiff
easterly wind treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and pippin were
bathing in the basin by the arch they heard him humming and singing as he came
up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he saw them you
sleep long i have been many a hundred strides already today now we will have a
drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar but from a different jar
the taste was not the same as it had been the night before: it was earthier and
richer more sustaining and food-like so to speak while the hobbits drank
sitting on the edge of the bed and nibbling small pieces of elf-cake more
because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because
they felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or elvish or some strange
tongue and looking up at the sky
where is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round it is not a place it is
a gathering of ents - which does not often happen nowadays but i have managed
to make a fair number promise to come we shall meet in the place where we have
always met: derndingle men call it it is away south from here we must be there
before noon
before long they set off treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the
previous day at the entrance to the court he turned to the right stepped over
the stream and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes
where trees were scanty above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and
rowan and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods soon treebeard turned a little
away from the hills and plunged into deep groves where the trees were larger
taller and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before for a while
they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first
ventured into fangorn but it soon passed treebeard did not talk to them he
hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and pippin caught no proper
words: it sounded like boom boom rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom
boom dahrar boom and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm now
and again they thought they heard an answer a hum or a quiver of sound that
seemed to come out of the earth or from boughs above their heads or perhaps
from the boles of the trees but treebeard did not stop or turn his head to
either side
they had been going for a long while - pippin had tried to keep count of the
ent-strides but had failed getting lost at about three thousand - when
treebeard began to slacken his pace suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down
and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube then
he blew or called through them a great hoom hom rang out like a
deep-throated horn in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees far off
there came from several directions a similar hoom hom hoom that was not
an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and strode on again
every now and then sending out another horn-call and each time the answers came
louder and nearer in this way they came at last to what looked like an
impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of a kind that the hobbits had
never seen before: they branched out right from the roots and were densely clad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and they bore many stiff upright
flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treebeard came in a few
strides to a narrow entrance through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly
down a long steep slope the hobbits saw that they were descending into a great
dingle almost as round as a bowl very wide and deep crowned at the rim with
the high dark evergreen hedge it was smooth and grassclad inside and there
were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at
the bottom of the bowl two other paths led down into the dingle: from the west
and from the east
several ents had already arrived more were coming in down the other paths
and some were now following treebeard as they drew near the hobbits gazed at
them they had expected to see a number of creatures as much like treebeard as
one hobbit is like another at any rate to a strangers eye and they were very
much surprised to see nothing of the kind the ents were as different from one
another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of
the same name but quite different growth and history and some as different as
one tree-kind from another as birch from beech oak from fir there were a few
older ents bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees though none looked
as ancient as treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean-limbed and
smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime but there were no young ents
no saplings altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy
floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw:
the many shapes and colours the differences in girth and height and length
of leg and arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from three to
nine a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and reminded them of
beech-trees or oaks but there were other kinds some recalled the chestnut:
brown-skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs some
recalled the ash: tall straight grey ents with many-fingered hands and long
legs some the fir the tallest ents and others the birch the rowan and the
linden but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their heads
slightly murmuring in their slow musical voices and looking long and intently
at the strangers then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred
and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as treebeards but all
with the same slow steady thoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in a wide circle round
treebeard a curious and unintelligible conversation began the ents began to
murmur slowly: first one joined and then another until they were all chanting
together in a long rising and falling rhythm now louder on one side of the
ring now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side though
he could not catch or understand any of the words - he supposed the language was
entish - pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first but
gradually his attention wavered after a long time and the chant showed no
signs of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was such an
unhasty language whether they had yet got further than good morning
and if treebeard was to call the roll how many days it would take to sing all
their names i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he
thought he yawned
treebeard was immediately aware of him hm ha hey my pippin he
said and the other ents all stopped their chant you are a hasty folk i was
forgetting and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not
understand you may get down now i have told your names to the entmoot and
they have seen you and they have agreed that you are not orcs and that a new
line shall be put in the old lists we have got no further yet but that is
quick work for an entmoot you and merry can stroll about in the dingle if you
like there is a well of good water if you need refreshing away yonder in the
north bank there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins i
will come and see you again and tell you how things are going
he put the hobbits down before they walked away they bowed low this feat
seemed to amuse the ents very much to judge by the tone of their murmurs and
the flicker of their eyes but they soon turned back to their own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west and looked
through the opening in the great hedge long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip
of the dingle and away beyond them above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge
there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain southwards to their
left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance there
far away there was a pale green glimmer that merry guessed to be a glimpse of
the plains of rohan
i wonder where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but that peak is probably
methedras and as far as i can remember the ring of isengard lies in a fork or
deep cleft at the end of the mountains it is probably down behind this great
ridge there seems to be a smoke or haze over there left of the peak dont you
think
what is isengard like said pippin i wonder what ents can do about it
anyway
so do i said merry isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills i
think with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle
called orthanc saruman has a tower on it there is a gate perhaps more than
one in the encircling wall and i believe there is a stream running through it
it comes out of the mountains and flows on across the gap of rohan it does not
seem the sort of place for ents to tackle but i have an odd feeling about these
ents: somehow i dont think they are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet i believe they could
be roused if that happened i would rather not be on the other side
yes said pippin i know what you mean there might be all the difference
between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull charging and
the change might come suddenly i wonder if treebeard will rouse them i am sure
he means to try but they dont like being roused treebeard got roused himself
last night and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back the voices of the ents were still rising and falling
in their conclave the sun had now risen high enough to look over the high
hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward side of the
dingle with a cool yellow light there they saw a little glittering fountain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens-it was
pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again and not to be in a hurry-and
then they climbed down to the gushing water they drank a little a clean cold
sharp draught and sat down on a mossy stone watching the patches of sun on the
grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the
dingle the murmur of the ents went on it seemed a very strange and remote
place outside their world and far from everything that had ever happened to
them a great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their
companions especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent-voices and looking up they saw
treebeard coming towards them with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard are you getting weary or
feeling impatient hmm eh well i am afraid that you must not get impatient
yet we have finished the first stage now but i have still got to explain
things again to those that live a long way off far from isengard and those
that i could not get round to before the moot and after that we shall have to
decide what to do however deciding what to do does not take ents so long as
going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of days
very likely so i have brought you a companion he has an ent-house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name he says he has already made up his mind and does
not need to remain at the moot hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a
hasty ent you ought to get on together good-bye treebeard turned and left
them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly and they looked
at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness he was tall and
seemed to be one of the younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms and
legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey-green he could bend and sway
like a slender tree in the wind at last he spoke and his voice though resonant
was higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said i am bregalad that is
quickbeam in your language but it is only a nickname of course they have
called me that ever since i said yes to an elder ent before he had
finished his question also i drink quickly and go out while some are still
wetting their beards come with me
he reached down two shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand to each of the
hobbits all that day they walked about in the woods with him singing and
laughing for quickbeam often laughed he laughed if the sun came out from
behind a cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or spring: then he stooped
and splashed his feet and head with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or
whisper in the trees whenever he saw a rowan-tree he halted a while with his
arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than a mossy
stone set upon turves under a green bank rowan-trees grew in a circle about it
and there was water as in all ent-houses a spring bubbling out from the bank
they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest not far away the voices
of the entmoot could be heard still going on but now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high and
quickening music while all the others died away but beside them bregalad spoke
gently in their own tongue almost whispering and they learned that he belonged
to skinbarks people and the country where they had lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his hastiness at least in
the matter of orcs
there were rowan-trees in my home said bregalad softly and sadly
rowan-trees that took root when i was an enting many many years ago in the
quiet of the world the oldest were planted by the ents to try and please the
entwives but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where
whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing yet there are no trees of all that
race the people of the rose that are so beautiful to me and these trees grew
and grew till the shadow of each was like a green hall and their red berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder birds used to flock
there i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan has enough and to
spare but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at the trees and
threw the fruit down and did not eat it then orcs came with axes and cut down
my trees i came and called them by their long names but they did not quiver
they did not hear or answer: they lay dead
o orofarnë lassemista carnimírië

o rowan fair upon your hair how white the blossom lay

o rowan mine i saw you shine upon a summers day

your rind so bright your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft:

upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft

o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and grey

your crown is spilled your voice is stilled for ever and a day

o orofarnë lassemista carnimírië
the hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of bregalad that
seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in his company but they did not go far from his
house most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank for the
wind was colder and the clouds closer and greyer there was little sunshine
and in the distance the voices of the ents at the moot still rose and fell
sometimes loud and strong sometimes low and sad sometimes quickening
sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge a second night came and still the ents
held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third day broke bleak and windy at sunrise the ents voices rose to a
great clamour and then died down again as the morning wore on the wind fell and
the air grew heavy with expectancy the hobbits could see that bregalad was now
listening intently although to them down in the dell of his ent-house the
sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the mountains sent out
long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds suddenly they
were aware that everything was very quiet the whole forest stood in listening
silence of course the ent-voices had stopped what did that mean bregalad was
standing up erect and tense looking back northwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah the trees
quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them there was another pause and
then a marching music began like solemn drums and above the rolling beats and
booms there welled voices singing high and strong
we come we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom
the ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:
we come we come with horn and drum: ta-rûna
rûna rûna rom
bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house
before long they saw the marching line approaching: the ents were swinging
along with great strides down the slope towards them treebeard was at their
head and some fifty followers were behind him two abreast keeping step with
their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks as they drew
near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we come at last called treebeard
when he caught sight of bregalad and the hobbits come join the moot we are
off we are off to isengard
to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard
to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone

though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bone

we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door

for bole and bough are burning now the furnace roars - we go to war

to land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of drum we come we come
to isengard with doom we come
with doom we come with doom we come
so they sang as they marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into the line beside treebeard the old ent
now took the hobbits back and set them on his shoulders again and so they rode
proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held
high though they had expected something to happen eventually they were amazed
at the change that had come over the ents it seemed now as sudden as the
bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike
the ents made up their minds rather quickly after all didnt they pippin
ventured to say after some time when for a moment the singing paused and only
the beating of hands and feet was heard
quickly said treebeard hoom yes indeed quicker than i expected
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age we ents do not
like being roused and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our lives are in great danger that has not happened in this forest
since the wars of sauron and the men of the sea it is the orc-work the wanton
hewing - rárum - without even
the bad excuse of feeding the fires that has so angered us and the treachery
of a neighbour who should have helped us wizards ought to know better: they do
know better there is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues of men bad
enough for such treachery down with saruman
will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not know perhaps how strong we
are maybe you have heard of trolls they are mighty strong but trolls are only
counterfeits made by the enemy in the great darkness in mockery of ents as
orcs were of elves we are stronger than trolls we are made of the bones of the
earth we can split stone like the roots of trees only quicker far quicker if
our minds are roused if we are not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast of
sorcery we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into
rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so i have not forgotten it indeed i have thought long
about it but you see many of the ents are younger than i am by many lives of
trees they are all roused now and their mind is all on one thing: breaking
isengard but they will start thinking again before long they will cool down a
little when we take our evening drink what a thirst we shall have but let
them march now and sing we have a long way to go and there is time ahead for
thought it is something to have started
treebeard marched on singing with the others for a while but after a time
his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again pippin could see that his old
brow was wrinkled and knotted at last he looked up and pippin could see a sad
look in his eyes sad but not unhappy there was a light in them as if the
green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my friends he said slowly likely enough
that we are going to our doom: the last march of the ents but if we stayed at
home and did nothing doom would find us anyway sooner or later that thought
has long been growing in our hearts and that is why we are marching now it was
not a hasty resolve now at least the last march of the ents may be worth a
song aye he sighed we may help the other peoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs come true about the entwives i
should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil again but there my friends songs
like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes
they are withered untimely
the ents went striding on at a great pace they had descended into a long
fold of the land that fell away southward now they began to climb up and up
on to the high western ridge the woods fell away and they came to scattered
groups of birch and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew
the sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front grey dusk fell
pippin looked behind the number of the ents had grown - or what was
happening where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie he
thought he saw groves of trees but they were moving could it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was rising marching over the hills to
war he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him but the
great grey shapes moved steadily onward there was a noise like wind in many
branches the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now and all song
had ceased night fell and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a
faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ents and a rustle the shade
of a whisper as of many drifting leaves at last they stood upon the summit and
looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of
the mountains: nan curunír the valley of saruman
night lies over isengard said treebeard
 
my very bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his
feet day had come at last at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as
they could now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the
ground again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that old man said gimli i should be happier if i could
see the print of a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he
seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass
is deep and springy
that would not baffle a ranger said gimli a bent blade is enough for
aragorn to read but i do not expect him to find any traces it was an evil
phantom of saruman that we saw last night i am sure of it even under the light
of morning his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragorn yet i am not sure i am thinking of the
horses you said last night gimli that they were scared away but i did not
think so did you hear them legolas did they sound to you like beasts in
terror
no said legolas i heard them clearly but for the darkness and our own
fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read the riddle unless they
return come the light is growing fast let us look first and guess later we
should begin here near to our own camping-ground searching carefully all
about and working up the slope towards the forest to find the hobbits is our
errand whatever we may think of our visitor in the night if they escaped by
some chance then they must have hidden in the trees or they would have been
seen if we find nothing between here and the eaves of the wood then we will
make a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes but there is
little hope there: the horsemen of rohan did their work too well
for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground the tree
stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now hanging limp and rattling in
the chill easterly wind aragorn moved slowly away he came to the ashes of the
watch-fire near the river-bank and then began to retrace the ground back
towards the knoll where the battle had been fought suddenly he stooped and bent
low with his face almost in the grass then he called to the others they came
running up
here at last we find news said aragorn he lifted up a broken leaf for
them to see a large pale leaf of golden hue now fading and
turning brown here is a mallorn-leaf of lórien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grass and see there are some pieces
of cut cord lying nearby
and here is the knife that cut them said gimli he stooped and drew out of
a tussock into which some heavy foot had trampled it a short jagged blade the
haft from which it had been snapped was beside it it was an orc-weapon he
said holding it gingerly and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had
been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed
legolas a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding
horsemen he then stops while still in the open and cuts his bonds with an
orc-knife but how and why for if his legs were tied how did he walk and if
his arms were tied how did he use the knife and if neither were tied why did
he cut the cords at all being pleased with his skill he then sat down and
quietly ate some waybread that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit
without the mallorn-leaf after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees it should be easy to find him: we only
need wings ourselves
there was sorcery here right enough said gimli what was that old man
doing what have you to say aragorn to the reading of legolas can you better
it
maybe i could said aragorn smiling there are some other signs near at
hand that you have not considered i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and
must have had either legs or hands free before he came here i guess that it
was hands because the riddle then becomes easier and also because as i read
the marks he was carried to this point by an orc blood was spilled
there a few paces away orc-blood there are deep prints of hoofs all about
this spot and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away the orc was slain by
horsemen and later his body was hauled to the fire but the hobbit was not
seen: he was not "in the open" for it was night and he still had his
elven-cloak he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to be wondered at that
when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy he rested and ate
a little before he crept away but it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas
in his pocket even though he ran away without gear or pack that perhaps is
like a hobbit i say he though i hope and guess that both merry and
pippin were here together there is however nothing to show that for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free
asked gimli
i do not know how it happened answered aragorn nor do i know why an orc
was carrying them away not to help them to escape we may be sure nay rather
i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the
beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of
merry and pippin they did not seek out the rest of us nor attack our camp but
instead they went with all speed towards isengard did they suppose they had
captured the ring-bearer and his faithful comrade i think not their masters
would not dare to give such plain orders to orcs even if they knew so much
themselves they would not speak openly to them of the ring: they are not trusty
servants but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture hobbits
alive at all costs an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners
before the battle treachery perhaps likely enough with such folk some large
and bold orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone for his own
ends there that is my tale others might be devised but on this we may count
in any case: one at least of our friends escaped it is our task to find him and
help him before we return to rohan we must not be daunted by fangorn since
need drove him into that dark place
i do not know which daunts me more: fangorn or the thought of the long road
through rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs at one point near the bank
of the entwash he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints but too light for much
to be made of them then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge
of the wood more prints were discovered the earth was bare and dry and did not
reveal much
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back and then he
turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli but i do not like the look of this
fangorn: and we were warned against it i wish the chase had led anywhere else
i do not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said legolas
he stood under the eaves of the forest stooping forward as if he were
listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows no it is not evil or
what evil is in it is far away i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places
where the hearts of the trees are black there is no malice near us but there
is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli i have done it no
harm 
that is just as well said legolas but nonetheless it has suffered harm
there is something happening inside or going to happen do you not feel the
tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf this wood is lighter than
mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said the elf so old that almost i feel young again
as i have not felt since i journeyed with you children it is old and full of
memory i could have been happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli you are a wood-elf anyway though
elves of any kind are strange folk yet you comfort me where you go i will go
but keep your bow ready to hand and i will keep my axe loose in my belt not
for use on trees he added hastily looking up at the tree under which they
stood i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready
to hand that is all let us go
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn legolas and
gimli left the tracking to aragorn there was little for him to see the floor
of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves but guessing that the
fugitives would stay near the water he returned often to the banks of the
stream so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk
and bathed their feet there plain for all to see were the footprints of two
hobbits one somewhat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said aragorn yet the marks are two days old and it
seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side
then what shall we do now said gimli we cannot pursue them through the
whole fastness of fangorn we have come ill supplied if we do not find them
soon we shall be of no use to them except to sit down beside them and show our
friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then we must do that said aragorn let
us go on
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeards hill and looked up
at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf gleams of sun
were striking through the hurrying clouds and the forest now looked less grey
and drear
let us go up and look about us said legolas i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up aragorn came last moving slowly: he was scanning
the steps and ledges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here he said but there
are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand i wonder if we
can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went
next
he stood up and looked about but he saw nothing that was of any use the
shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the east was the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain
from which they had come
we have journeyed a long way round said legolas we could have all come
here safe together if we had left the great river on the second or third day
and struck west few can foresee whither their road will lead them till they
come to its end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net said legolas look
look at what said gimli
there in the trees
where i have not elf-eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointing down in the wood
back in the way that we have just come it is he cannot you see him passing
from tree to tree
i see i see now hissed gimli look aragorn did i not warn you there
is the old man all in dirty grey rags: that is why i could not see him at
first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar-man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff his
head was bowed and he did not look towards them in other lands they would have
greeted him with kind words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power-or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step by step the figure drew
nearer then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out: your
bow legolas bend it get ready it is saruman do not let him speak or put a
spell upon us shoot first
legolas took his bow and bent it slowly and as if some other will resisted
him he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are you waiting what is the matter with you said gimli in a hissing
whisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly we may not shoot an old man so at
unawares and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us watch and wait
at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed
to the foot of the rock-wall then suddenly he looked up while they stood
motionless looking down there was no sound
they could not see his face: he was hooded and above the hood he wore a
wide-brimmed hat so that all his features were over-shadowed except for the
end of his nose and his grey beard yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the
gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence well met indeed my friends he said
in a soft voice i wish to speak to you will you come down or shall i come
up without waiting for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli stop him legolas
did i not say that i wished to speak to you said the old man put away
that bow master elf
the bow and arrow fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his
sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your axe-haft till i am up
you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stood still as stone staring while the old man
sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat all weariness seemed to have left
him as he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam too brief for
certainty a quick glint of white as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags
had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis breath could be heard as
a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them when he was a
few feet away he stood stooping over his staff with his head thrust forward
peering at them from under his hood and what may you be doing in these parts
an elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion no doubt there is a tale
worth hearing behind it all such things are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well said aragorn is that so
not well said the old man: that would be the study of many lives but i
come here now and again
might we know your name and then hear what it is that you have to say to
us said aragorn the morning passes and we have an errand that will not
wait
as for what i wished to say i have said it: what may you be doing and what
tale can you tell of yourselves as for my name he broke off laughing long
and softly aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound a strange cold
thrill and yet it was not fear or terror that he felt: rather it was like the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy
sleeper
my name said the old man again have you not guessed it already you have
heard it before i think yes you have heard it before but come now what of
your tale
the three companions stood silent and made no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell
said the old man happily i know something of it you are tracking the
footsteps of two young hobbits i believe yes hobbits dont stare as if you
had never heard the strange name before you have and so have i well they
climbed up here the day before yesterday and they met someone that they did not
expect does that comfort you and now you would like to know where they were
taken well well maybe i can give you some news about that but why are we
standing your errand you see is no longer as urgent as you thought let us
sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at
the foot of the cliff behind immediately as if a spell had been removed the
others relaxed and stirred gimlis hand went at once to his axe-haft aragorn
drew his sword legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond doubt that he was clothed
beneath all in white
saruman cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand speak tell
us where you have hidden our friends what have you done with them speak or i
will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with
the old man was too quick for him he sprang to his feet and leaped to the
top of a large rock there he stood grown suddenly tall towering above them
his hood and his grey rags were flung away his white garments shone he lifted
up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the
ground the sword of aragorn stiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden
fire legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it
vanished in a flash of flame
mithrandir he cried mithrandir
well met i say to you again legolas said the old man
they all gazed at him his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes under his deep brows were bright piercing
as the rays of the sun power was in his hand between wonder joy and fear
they stood and found no words to say
at last aragorn stirred gandalf he said beyond all hope you return to
us in our need what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing hut
sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalling from old memory a long
disused word yes that was the name i was gandalf
he stepped down from the rock and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about
him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you may still call me gandalf he said and the voice was the voice of
their old friend and guide get up my good gimli no blame to you and no harm
done to me indeed my friends none of you have any weapon that could hurt me
be merry we meet again at the turn of the tide the great storm is coming but
the tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the dwarf looked up and laughed
suddenly gandalf he said but you are all in white
yes i am white now said gandalf indeed i am saruman one might
almost say saruman as he should have been but come now tell me of yourselves
i have passed through fire and deep water since we parted i have forgotten
much that i thought i knew and learned again much that i had forgotten i can
see many things far off but many things that are close at hand i cannot see
tell me of yourselves
what do you wish to know said aragorn all that has happened since we
parted on the bridge would be a long tale will you not first give us news of
the hobbits did you find them and are they safe
no i did not find them said gandalf there was a darkness over the
valleys of the emyn muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle
told me
the eagle said legolas i have seen an eagle high and far off: the last
time was three days ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from
orthanc i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings his sight
is keen but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree some things he
has seen and others i have seen myself the ring now has passed beyond my help
or the help of any of the company that set out from rivendell very nearly it
was revealed to the enemy but it escaped i had some part in that: for i sat in
a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadow passed then i
was weary very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli how do things go with him
i cannot say he was saved from a great peril but many lie before him
still he resolved to go alone to mordor and he set out: that is all that i can
say
not alone said legolas we think that sam went with him
did he said gandalf and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his
face did he indeed it is news to me yet it does not surprise me good very
good you lighten my heart you must tell me more now sit by me and tell me the
tale of your journey
the companions sat on the ground at his feet and aragorn took up the tale
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no questions his hands were
spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed at last when aragorn spoke of
the death of boromir and of his last journey upon the great river the old man
sighed
you have not said all that you know or guess aragorn my friend he said
quietly poor boromir i could not see what happened to him it was a sore
trial for such a man: a warrior and a lord of men galadriel told me that he
was in peril but he escaped in the end i am glad it was not in vain that the
young hobbits came with us if only for boromirs sake but that is not the only
part they have to play they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains even as
we talk here i hear the first rumblings saruman had best not be caught away
from home when the dam bursts
in one thing you have not changed dear friend said aragorn: you still
speak in riddles
what in riddles said gandalf no for i was talking aloud to myself a
habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to the long
explanations needed by the young are wearying he laughed but the sound now
seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even in the reckoning of men of the ancient houses
said aragorn will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused for a while in thought
this in brief is how i see things at the moment if you wish to have a piece of
my mind as plain as possible the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit he knows now the number of our
company that set out from rivendell and the kind of each of us but he does not
yet perceive our purpose clearly he supposes that we were all going to minas
tirith for that is what he would himself have done in our place and according
to his wisdom it would have been a heavy stroke against his power indeed he is
in great fear not knowing what mighty one may suddenly appear wielding the
ring and assailing him with war seeking to cast him down and take his place
that we should wish to cast him down and have no one in his place is not a
thought that occurs to his mind that we should try to destroy the ring itself
has not yet entered into his darkest dream in which no doubt you will see our
good fortune and our hope for imagining war he has let loose war believing
that he has no time to waste for he that strikes the first blow if he strikes
it hard enough may need to strike no more so the forces that he has long been
preparing he is now setting in motion sooner than he intended wise fool for
if he had used all his power to guard mordor so that none could enter and bent
all his guild to the hunting of the ring then indeed hope would have faded:
neither ring nor bearer could long have eluded him but now his eye gazes abroad
rather than near at home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith very soon
now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the company
have failed again they have not found the ring neither have they brought away
any hobbits as hostages had they done even so much as that it would have been
a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal but let us not darken our
hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower for the
enemy has failed-so far thanks to saruman:
then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
indeed yes said gandalf doubly and is not that strange nothing that we
have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard even
reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong he threatens the
men of rohan and draws off their help from minas tirith even as the main blow
is approaching from the east yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the
hand saruman also had a mind to capture the ring for himself or at least to
snare some hobbits for his evil purposes so between them our enemies have
contrived only to bring merry and pippin with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwise they would never have come at all
also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the battle will come to mordor thanks to the horsemen of rohan
but the dark lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and borne
away towards isengard against the will of his own servants he now has isengard
to fear as well as minas tirith if minas tirith falls it will go ill with
saruman
it is a pity that our friends lie in between said gimli if no land
divided isengard and mordor then they could fight while we watched and waited
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said
gandalf but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains the
ring that he will never do now he does not yet know his peril there is much
that he does not know he was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he
could not wait at home and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers
but he came too late for once and the battle was over and beyond his help
before he reached these parts he did not remain here long i look into his mind
and i see his doubt he has no woodcraft he believes that the horsemen slew and
burned all upon the field of battle but he does not know whether the orcs were
bringing any prisoners or not and he does not know of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor does he know of the winged messenger
the winged messenger cried legolas i shot at him with the bow of
galadriel above sarn gebir and i felled him from the sky he filled us all with
fear what new terror is this
one that you cannot slay with arrows said
gandalf you only slew his steed it was a good deed but the rider was soon
horsed again for he was a nazgûl one of the nine who ride now upon
winged steeds soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of our friends
cutting off the sun but they have not yet been allowed to cross the river and
saruman does not know of this new shape in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the ring was it present in the battle was it found
what if théoden lord of the mark should come by it and learn of
its power that is the danger that he sees and he has fled back to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan and all the time there is another
danger close at hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts he
has forgotten treebeard
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile treebeard is
not known to me and i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet i do
not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to fangorn has served save to
give us a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli there is another thing that i should like to
know first was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last night
you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore i must guess
that you saw saruman evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make
an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli i am glad that it was not you
gandalf laughed again yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort not to
be mistaken at all points do i not know it only too well but of course i
never blamed you for your welcome of me how could i do so who have so often
counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with
the enemy bless you gimli son of glóin maybe you will see us both
together one day and judge between us
but the hobbits legolas broke in we have come far to seek them and you
seem to know where they are where are they now
with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
the ents exclaimed aragorn then there is truth in the old legends about
the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees are there
still ents in the world i thought they were only a memory of ancient days if
indeed they were ever more than a legend of rohan
a legend of rohan cried legolas nay every elf in wilderland has sung
songs of the old onodrim and their long sorrow yet even among us they are only
a memory if i were to meet one still walking in this world then indeed i
should feel young again but treebeard: that is only a rendering of fangorn into
the common speech yet you seem to speak of a person who is this treebeard
ah now you are asking much said gandalf the little that i know of his
long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now treebeard is
fangorn the guardian of the forest he is the oldest of the ents the oldest
living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this middle-earth i hope
indeed legolas that you may yet meet him merry and pippin have been
fortunate: they met him here even where we sit for he came here two days ago
and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains he
often comes here especially when his mind is uneasy and rumours of the world
outside trouble him i saw him four days ago striding among the trees and i
think he saw me for he paused but i did not speak for i was heavy with
thought and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor and he did not
speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought that you were saruman said gimli but you speak
of him as if he was a friend i thought fangorn was dangerous
dangerous cried gandalf and so am i very dangerous: more dangerous
than anything you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before the seat
of the dark lord and aragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous you are
beset with dangers gimli son of glóin for you are dangerous yourself
in your own fashion certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous-not
least to those that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himself he is
perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless but now his long slow wrath
is brimming over and all the forest is filled with it the coming of the
hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be
running like a flood but its tide is turned against saruman and the axes of
isengard a thing is about to happen which has not happened since the elder
days: the ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf i do not think they know themselves i
wonder he fell silent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at him a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled with light as
a cup is with water at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing away he said soon we must go
do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandalf that is not the road that you must take i have spoken
words of hope but only of hope hope is not victory war is upon us and all our
friends a war in which only the use of the ring could give us surety of
victory it fills me with great sorrow and great fear: for much shall be
destroyed and all may be lost i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is
mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyes as if he saw things far
away that none of them could see then he shook his head no he said in a
soft voice it has gone beyond our reach of that at least let us be glad we
can no longer be tempted to use the ring we must go down to face a peril near
despair yet that deadly peril is removed
he turned come aragorn son of arathorn he said do not regret your
choice in the valley of the emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit you chose
amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice
was just and it has been rewarded for so we have met in time who otherwise
might have met too late but the quest of your companions is over your next
journey is marked by your given word you must go to edoras and seek out théoden
in his hall for you are needed the light of andúril must now be
uncovered in the battle for which it has so long waited there is war in rohan
and worse evil: it goes ill with théoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so said gandalf who knows have patience go where you
must go and hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to walk young or old said aragorn i fear the
battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf will you come now with me
yes we will set out together said aragorn but i do not doubt that you
will come there before me if you wish he rose and looked long at gandalf the
others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one another the grey
figure of the man aragorn son of arathorn was tall and stern as stone his
hand upon the hilt of his sword he looked as if some king out of the mists of
the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men before him stooped the old
figure white shining now as if with some light kindled within bent laden
with years but holding a power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last that you could go
whithersoever you wished quicker than i and this i also say: you are our
captain and our banner the dark lord has nine but we have one mightier than
they: the white rider he has passed through the fire and the abyss and they
shall fear him we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas but first it would ease
my heart gandalf to hear what befell you in moria will you not tell us can
you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered
i have stayed already too long answered gandalf time is short but if
there were a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli come gandalf
tell us how you fared with the balrog
name him not said gandalf and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain
passed over his face and he sat silent looking old as death long time i
fell he said at last slowly as if thinking back with difficulty long i
fell and he fell with me his fire was about me i was burned then we plunged
into the deep water and all was dark cold it was as the tide of death: almost
it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins bridge and none has measured
it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf thither i
came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone he was with me still his
fire was quenched but now he was a thing of slime stronger than a strangling
snake
we fought far under the living earth where time is not counted ever he
clutched me and ever i hewed him till at last he
fled into dark tunnels they were not made by durins folk gimli son of glóin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwarves the world is gnawed by
nameless things even sauron knows them not they are older than he now i have
walked there but i will bring no report to darken the light of day in that
despair my enemy was my only hope and i pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of khazad-dûm: too well
he knew them all ever up now we went until we came to the endless
stair
long has that been lost said gimli many have said that it was never made
save in legend but others say that it was destroyed
it was made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf from the lowest
dungeon to the highest peak it climbed ascending in unbroken spiral in many
thousand steps until it issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirak-zigil the pinnacle of the silvertine
there upon celebdil was a lonely window in the snow and before it lay a
narrow space a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world the sun shone fiercely
there but all below was wrapped in cloud out he sprang and even as i came
behind he burst into new flame there was none to see or perhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak suddenly gandalf laughed
but what would they say in song those that looked up from afar thought that
the mountain was crowned with storm thunder they heard and lightning they
said smote upon celebdil and leaped back broken into tongues of fire is not
that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam ice fell like rain
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the high place and broke the
mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin then darkness took me and i
strayed out of thought and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not
tell
naked i was sent back - for a brief time until my task is done and naked i
lay upon the mountain-top the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window
gone the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone i was alone
forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world there i lay staring
upward while the stars wheeled over and each day was as long as a life-age of
the earth faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all lands: the springing
and the dying the song and the weeping and the slow everlasting groan of
overburdened stone and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me again and
he took me up and bore me away
 ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
 a burden you have been he answered but not so now light as a swans
feather in my claw you are the sun shines through you indeed i do not think
you need me any more: were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
 do not let me fall i gasped for i felt life in me again bear me to
lothlórien
 that indeed is the command of the lady galadriel who sent me to look for
you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and found you but lately gone i
tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring healing not
decay healing i found and i was clothed in white counsel i gave and counsel
took thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to some of you to
aragorn i was bidden to say this:
where now are the dúnedain elessar elessar

why do thy kinsfolk wander afar

near is the hour when the lost should come forth

and the grey company ride from the north

but dark is the path appointed for thee:

the dead watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word:
legolas greenleaf long under tree

in joy thou hast lived beware of the sea

if thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore

thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message said gimli and bent his head
dark are her words said legolas and little do they mean to those that
receive them
that is no comfort said gimli
what then said legolas would you have her speak openly to you of your
death
yes if she had nought else to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes yes i think i can guess
what her words may mean your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once
again but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
 "to gimli son of glóin" she said "give his ladys
greeting lock-bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee but have a
care to lay thine axe to the right tree" 
in happy hour you have returned to us gandalf cried the dwarf capering
as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue come come he shouted
swinging his axe since gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one that it
is right to cleave
that will not be far to seek said gandalf rising from his seat come we
have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted friends now
there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the way
following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back
through the forest down the bank of the entwash they spoke no more words
until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn there was no
sign of their horses to be seen
they have not returned said legolas it will be a weary walk
i shall not walk time presses said gandalf then lifting up his head he
gave a long whistle so clear and piercing was the note that the others stood
amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips three times he
whistled and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the
whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind they waited
wondering before long there came the sound of hoofs at first hardly more than
a tremor of the ground perceptible only to aragorn as he lay upon the grass
then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
certainly said gandalf we are too great a burden for one
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain see how they
run there is hasufel and there is my friend arod beside him but there is
another that strides ahead: a very great horse i have not seen his like
before
nor will you again said gandalf that is shadowfax he is the chief of
the mearas lords of horses and not even théoden
king of rohan has ever looked on a better does he not shine like silver and
run as smoothly as a swift stream he has come for me: the horse of the
white rider we are going to battle together
even as the old wizard spoke the great horse came striding up the slope
towards them his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his
speed the two others followed now far behind as soon as shadowfax saw
gandalf he checked his pace and whinnied loudly then trotting gently forward
he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old mans
neck
gandalf caressed him it is a long way from rivendell my friend he said
but you are wise and swift and come at need far let us ride now together and
part not in this world again
soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to meduseld the hall of your
master théoden said gandalf addressing them gravely they bowed their
heads time presses so with your leave my friends we will ride we beg you
to use all the speed that you can hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli before me and by his leave shadowfax shall bear us
both we will wait now only to drink a little
now i understand a part of last nights riddle said legolas as he sprang
lightly upon arods back whether they fled at first in fear or not our
horses met shadowfax their chieftain and greeted him with joy did you know
that he was at hand gandalf
yes i knew said the wizard i bent my thought upon him bidding him to
make haste for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land swiftly may
he bear me back again
gandalf spoke now to shadowfax and the horse set off at a good pace yet not
beyond the measure of the others after a little while he turned suddenly and
choosing a place where the banks were lower he waded the river and then led
them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide the wind went like grey
waves through the endless miles of grass there was no sign of road or track
but shadowfax did not stay or falter
he is steering a straight course now for the halls of
théoden under the slopes of the white mountains said gandalf it will
be quicker so the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief northward
track lies across the river but shadowfax knows the way through every fen and
hollow
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands often the grass
was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders and their steeds
seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea they came upon many hidden pools and
broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs but shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed in his swath slowly the sun fell from
the sky down into the west looking out over the great plain far away the
riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass low upon the
edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side a smoke
seemed to rise up and darken the suns disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan said gandalf it is now almost due west of
us that way lies isengard
i see a great smoke said legolas what may that be
battle and war said gandalf ride on
 
they rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering night when at last
they halted and dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary gandalf only
allowed them a few hours rest legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat
stretched upon his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing into
the darkness east and west all was silent and there was no sign or sound of
living thing the night was barred with long clouds fleeting on a chill wind
when they arose again under the cold moon they went on once more as swift as
by the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on gimli nodded and would have fallen from
his seat if gandalf had not clutched and shaken him hasufel and arod weary
but proud followed their tireless leader a grey shadow before them hardly to
he seen the miles went by the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter chill came into the air slowly in the east the dark faded to a cold
grey red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the emyn muil far away
upon their left dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across their path
rushing through the bent grasses suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
gandalf pointed ahead
look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes before them stood the
mountains of the south: white-tipped and streaked with black the grass-lands
rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet and flowed up into many
valleys still dim and dark untouched by the light of dawn winding their way
into the heart of the great mountains immediately before the travellers the
widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills far inward they
glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one tall peak at the mouth of the vale
there stood like sentinel a lonely height about its feet there flowed as a
thread of silver the stream that issued from the dale upon its brow they
caught still far away a glint in the rising sun a glimmer of gold speak
legolas said gandalf tell us what you see there before us
legolas gazed ahead shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new-risen
sun i see a white stream that comes down from the snows he said where it
issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon the east a dike and
mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it within there rise the roofs of houses
and in the midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of
men and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold the light of it
shines far over the land golden too are the posts of its doors there men in
bright mail stand but all else within the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden
hall there dwells théoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan we
are come with the rising of the day now the road lies plain to see
before us but we must ride more warily for war is abroad and the rohirrim
the horse-lords do not sleep even if it seem so from afar draw no weapon
speak no haughty word i counsel you all until we are come before
théodens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and birds were singing when the
travellers came to the stream it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond
the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend flowing away east
to feed the entwash far off in its reed-choked beds the land was green: in the
wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow-trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips
feeling the approach of spring over the stream there was a ford between low
banks much trampled by the passage of horses the travellers passed over and
came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many mounds
high and green upon their western sides the grass was white as with a drifted
snow: small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the turf
look said gandalf how fair are the bright eyes in the grass evermind
they are called simbelmynë
in this land of men for they blossom in all the seasons of the year and grow
where dead men rest behold we are come to the great barrows where the sires of
théoden sleep seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right
said aragorn many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was
built
five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in mirkwood in my home since
then said legolas and but a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems so long ago said aragorn that the
raising of this house is but a memory of song and the years before are lost in
the mist of time now they call this land their home their own and their
speech is sundered from their northern kin then he began to chant softly in a
slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened for there was a
strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said legolas for it is
like to this land itself rich and rolling in part and else hard and stern as
the mountains but i cannot guess what it means save that it is laden with the
sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn as near as i can make it
where now the horse and the rider where is the horn that was blowing

where is the helm and the hauberk and the bright hair flowing

where is the hand on the harpstring and the red fire glowing

where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing

they have passed like rain on the mountain like a wind in the meadow

the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow

who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning

or behold the flowing years from the sea returning
thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how tall and fair
was eorl the young who rode down out of the north
and there were wings upon the feet of his steed felaróf father of
horses so men still sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds following the
winding way up the green shoulders of the hills they came at last to the wide
wind-swept walls and the gates of edoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprang at once to their feet and
barred the way with spears stay strangers here unknown they cried in the
tongue of the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness and they looked darkly upon
gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the same language yet
few strangers do so why then do you not speak in the common tongue as is the
custom in the west if you wish to be answered
it is the will of théoden king that none should enter his gates save
those who know our tongue and are our friends replied one of the guards none
are welcome here in days of war but our own folk and those that come
from mundburg in the land of gondor who are you that come heedless over the
plain thus strangely clad riding horses like to our own horses long have we
kept guard here and we have watched you from afar never have we seen other
riders so strange nor any horse more proud than is one of these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell say
are you not a wizard some spy from saruman or phantoms of his craft speak now
and be swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do your eyes cheat you for indeed
these are your own horses that we ride as you knew well are you asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable here are hasufel and arod
that éomer the third marshal of the mark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back now even as we promised him has not éomer then
returned and given warning of our coming
a troubled look came into the guards eyes of éomer i have naught to
say he answered if what you tell me is truth then doubtless théoden
will have heard of it maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for it is but
two nights ago that wormtongue came to us and said that by the will of théoden
no stranger should pass these gates
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard say no more my
errand is not to wormtongue but to the lord of the mark himself i am in haste
will you not go or send to say that we are come his eyes glinted under his
deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly but what names shall i report and
what shall i say of you old and weary you seem now and yet you are fell and
grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard for i am gandalf i have
returned and behold i too bring back a horse here is shadowfax the great
whom no other hand can tame and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundburg that he goes here also are legolas the elf
and gimli the dwarf our comrades go now and say to your master that we are at
his gates and would have speech with him if he will permit us to come into his
hall strange names you give indeed but i will report them as you bid and
learn my masters will said the guard wait here a little while and f will
bring you such answer as seems good to him do not hope too much these are dark
days he went swiftly away leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of
his comrades after some time he returned follow
me he said théoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that you
bear be it only a staff you must leave on the threshold the doorwardens will
keep them
the dark gates were swung open the travellers entered walking in file
behind their guide they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now winding
upward now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps many houses built of
wood and many dark doors they passed beside the way in a stone channel a stream
of clear water flowed sparkling and chattering at length they came to the
crown of the hill there stood a high platform above a green terrace at the
foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone carved in the likeness of a
horses head beneath was a wide basin from which the water spilled and fed the
falling stream up the green terrace went a stair of stone high and broad and
on either side of the topmost step were stone-hewn sea there sat other guards
with drawn swords laid upon their knees their golden hair was braided on their
shoulders the sun was blazoned upon their green shields their long corslets
were burnished bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide i must return now to my
duty at the gate farewell and may the lord of the mark be gracious to you
he turned and went swiftly back down the road the others climbed the long
stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen silent they stood now above and spoke
no word until gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own
tongue
hail corners from afar they said and they turned the hilts of their
swords towards the travellers in token of peace green gems flashed in the
sunlight then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of théoden he said háma is my name here
i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave into his hand his
silver-hafted knife his quiver and his bow keep these well he said for
they come from the golden wood and the lady of lothlórien gave them to
me
wonder came into the mans eyes and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall
as if he feared to handle them no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitating it is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver andúril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of théoden said háma
it is not clear to me that the will of théoden son of thengel even
though he be lord of the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son of
arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the house of théoden not of aragorn even were he king of
gondor in the seat of denethor said háma stepping swiftly before the
doors and barring the way his sword was now in his hand and the point towards
the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf needless is théodens demand but
it is useless to refuse a king will have his way in his own hall be it
folly or wisdom
truly said aragorn and i would do as the master of the house bade me
were this only a woodmans cot if i bore now any sword but andúril
whatever its name may be said háma here you shall lay it
if you would not fight alone against all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingering the blade of his axe and looking darkly
up at the guard as if he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell not
alone
come come said gandalf we are all friends here or should be for the
laughter of mordor will be our only reward if we quarrel my errand is
pressing here at least is my sword goodman
háma keep it well glamdring it is called for the elves made it long ago
now let me pass come aragorn
slowly aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright against
the wall here i set it he said but i command you not to touch it nor to
permit any other to lay hand on it in this elvish heath dwells the blade that
was broken and has been made again telchar first wrought it in the deeps of
time death shall come to any man that draws elendils sword save elendils
heir
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn it seems that
you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said it shall
be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has andúril to keep it company my axe may
stay here too without shame and he laid it on the floor now then if all
is as you wish let us go and speak with your master
the guard still hesitated your staff he said to gandalf forgive me but
that too must be left at the doors
foolishness said gandalf prudence is one thing but discourtesy is
another i am old if i may not lean on my stick as
i go then i will sit out here until it pleases théoden to hobble out
himself to speak with me
aragorn laughed every man has something too dear to trust to another but
would you part an old man from his support come will you not let us enter
the staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age said háma
he looked hard at the ash-staff on which gandalf leaned yet in doubt a man of
worth will trust to his own wisdom i believe you are friends and folk worthy
of honour who have no evil purpose you may go in
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly
inwards grumbling on their great hinges the travellers entered inside it
seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill the hall was long and
wide and filled with shadows and half lights mighty pillars upheld its lofty
roof but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the
eastern windows high under the deep eaves through the louver in the roof
above the thin wisps of issuing smoke the sky showed pale and blue as their
eyes changed the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with stones of
many hues branching runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now that the pillars were richly carved gleaming dully with gold and
half-seen colours many woven cloths were hung upon the walls and over their
wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim with years some
darkling in the shade but upon one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a
white horse he was blowing a great horn and his yellow hair was flying in the
wind the horses head was lifted and its nostrils were wide and red as it
neighed smelling battle afar foaming water green and white rushed and curled
about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn thus he rode out of the north to the
battle of the field of celebrant
now the four companions went forward past the clear wood-fire burning upon
the long hearth in the midst of the hall then they halted at the far end of
the house beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair upon it sat
a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was
long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circle set
upon his brow in the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond his
beard was laid like snow upon his knees but his eyes still burned with a bright
light glinting as he gazed at the strangers behind his chair stood a woman
clad in white at his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man with a
pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes
there was a silence the old man did not move in his
chair at length gandalf spoke hail théoden son of thengel i have
returned for behold the storm comes and now all friends should gather
together lest each singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning heavily upon a short black staff
with a handle of white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though he was
he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he said and maybe you look for welcome but truth to tell
your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf you have ever been a herald of
woe troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse i will not
deceive you: when i heard that shadowfax had come back riderless i rejoiced at
the return of the horse but still more at the lack
of the rider and when éomer brought the tidings that you had gone at
last to your long home i did not mourn but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils worse than before as might be
expected why should i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale man sitting upon the steps of the
dais it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that théodred
your son was slain upon the west marches: your right hand second marshal of the
mark in éomer there is little trust few men would be left to guard your
walls if he had been allowed to rule and even now we learn from gondor that
the dark lord is stirring in the east such is the hour in which this
wanderer chooses to return why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow láthspell
i name you ill-news and ill news is an ill guest they say he laughed grimly
as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark
eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless a great support
to your master answered gandalf in a soft voice yet in two ways may a man
come with evil tidings lie may be a worker of evil or he may be such as leaves
well alone and comes only to bring aid in time of need
that is so said wormtongue but there is a third kind: pickers of bones
meddlers in other mens sorrows carrion-fowl that grow fat on war what aid
have you ever brought stormcrow and what aid do you bring now it was aid from
us that you sought last time that you were here then my lord bade you choose
any horse that you would and be gone and to the wonder of all you took
shadowfax in your insolence my lord was sorely grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too great i guess that it is
likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears that i would call aid
that is our present need but who are these that follow at your tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late théoden son
of thengel said gandalf has not the messenger from your gate reported
the names of my companions seldom has any lord of rohan received three such
guests weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal man
even the mightiest grey is their raiment for the elves clad them and thus
they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as éomer reported that you are in league with the
sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue it is not to be wondered at:
webs of deceit were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but felt suddenly the hand of gandalf clutch him
by the shoulder and he halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lórien

seldom have walked the feet of men

few mortal eyes have seen the light

that lies there ever long and bright

galadriel galadriel

clear is the water of your well

white is the star in your white hand

unmarred unstained is leaf and land

in dwimordene in lórien

more fair than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he
changed casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned no longer on
his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice the wise speak only of what they
know gríma son of gálmód a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth i
have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man
till the lightning falls he raised his staff there was a roll of thunder the
sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows the whole hall became
suddenly dark as night the fire faded to sullen embers only gandalf could be
seen standing white and tall before the blackened hearth
in the gloom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice: did i not counsel
you lord to forbid his staff that fool háma
has betrayed us there was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof then
all was silent wormtongue sprawled on his face
now théoden son of thengel will you hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through the opening could be seen high
and far a patch of shining sky not all is dark take courage lord of the
mark for better help you will not find no counsel have i to give to those that
despair yet counsel i could give and words i could speak to you will you hear
them they are not for all ears i bid you come out before your doors and look
abroad too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to twisted tales and
crooked promptings
slowly théoden left his chair a faint light grew in the hall again
the woman hastened to the kings side taking his arm and with faltering steps
the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall wormtongue
remained lying on the floor they came to the doors and gandalf knocked
open he cried the lord of the mark comes forth
the doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in a wind was blowing on
the hill send your guards down to the stairs foot said gandalf and you
lady leave him a while with me i will care for him
go éowyn sister-daughter said the old king the time for fear is
past
the woman turned and went slowly into the house as she passed the doors she
turned and looked back grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on
the king with cool pity in her eyes very fair was her face and her long hair
was like a river of gold slender and tall she was in her white robe girt with
silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a
daughter of kings thus aragorn for the first time in the full light of day
beheld éowyn lady of rohan and thought her fair fair and cold like a
morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood and she now was
suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings wise with many winters
greycloaked hiding a power that yet she felt for a moment still as stone she
stood then turning swiftly she was gone
now lord said gandalf look out upon your land breathe the free air
again
from the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond the
stream the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey curtains of
wind-blown rain were slanting down the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thunder and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and already the storm that had come out
of the east was receding rolling away southward to the sea suddenly through a
rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down the falling showers
gleamed like silver and far away the river glittered like a shimmering glass
it is not so dark here said théoden
no said gandalf nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as some
would have you think cast aside your prop
from the kings hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones he drew
himself up slowly as a man that is stiff from long bending over some dull
toil now tall and straight he stood and his eyes were blue as he looked into
the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but i feel as one new-awakened
i would now that you had come before gandalf for i fear that already you have
come too late only to see the last days of my house not long now shall stand
the high hall which brego son of eorl built fire shall devour the high seat
what is to be done
much said gandalf but first send for éomer do i not guess
rightly that you hold him prisoner by the counsel of gríma of him that
all save you name the wormtongue
it is true said théoden he had rebelled against my commands and
threatened death to gríma in my hall
a man may love you and yet not love wormtongue or his counsels said
gandalf
that may be i will do as you ask call háma to me since he proved
untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand-runner the guilty shall bring
the guilty to judgement said théoden and his voice was grim yet he
looked at gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed
away and did not return
when háma had been summoned and had gone gandalf led théoden
to a stone seat and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hear said gandalf yet if my
hope is not cheated a time will come ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of wormtongue could
weave into your dreams but see you dream no longer you live gondor and rohan
do not stand alone the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have a hope
at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke his voice was low and secret and none save the
king heard what he said but ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in théodens
eye and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height and gandalf
beside him and together they looked out from the high place towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and clear that way lies
our hope where sits our greatest fear doom hangs still on a thread yet hope
there is still if we can but stand unconquered for a little while
the others too now turned their eyes eastward over the sundering leagues of
land far away they gazed to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore their
thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow where now was
the ring-bearer how thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still hung it
seemed to legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught a glint of
white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessly remote and yet a present threat there was a tiny
tongue of flame
slowly théoden sat down again as if weariness still struggled to
master him against the will of gandalf he turned and looked at his great
house alas he said that these evil days should be mine and should come in
my old age instead of that peace which i have earned alas for boromir the
brave the young perish and the old linger withering he clutched his knees
with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped a
sword-hilt said gandalf
théoden rose and put his hand to his side but no sword hung at his
belt where has gríma stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear voice it was ever at your service
two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top
éomer was there no helm was on his head no mail was on his breast
but in his hand he held a drawn sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to
his master
how comes this said théoden sternly he turned towards éomer
and the men looked in wonder at him standing now proud and erect where was the
old man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his
stick
it is my doing lord said háma trembling i understood that
éomer was to be set free such joy was in my heart that maybe i have
erred yet since he was free again and he a marshal of the mark
brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my lord said éomer
for a moment of silence théoden stood looking down at éomer as
he knelt still before him neither moved
will you not take the sword said gandalf
slowly théoden stretched forth his hand as his fingers took
the hilt it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his
thin arm suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in
the air then he gave a great cry his voice rang clear as he chanted in the
tongue of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riders of théoden

dire deeds awake dark is it eastward

let horse be bridled horn be sounded
forth eorlingas
the guards thinking that they were summoned sprang up the stair they
looked at their lord in amazement and then as one man they drew their swords
and laid them at his feet command us they said
westu théoden hál
cried éomer it is a joy to us to see you return into your own never
again shall it be said gandalf that you come only with grief
take back your sword éomer sister-son said the king go háma
and seek my own sword gríma has it in his keeping bring him to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to give if i would hear it what is
your counsel
you have yourself already taken it answered gandalf to put your trust in
éomer rather than in a man of crooked mind to cast aside regret and
fear to do the deed at hand every man that can ride should be sent west at
once as éomer counselled you: we must first destroy the threat of
saruman while we have time if we fail we fall if we succeed - then we will
face the next task meanwhile your people that are left the women and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that you have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this let them take
provision but delay not nor burden themselves with treasures great or small
it is their lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good to me now said théoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests-truly you said gandalf that the
courtesy of my hall is lessened you have ridden through the night and the
morning wears away you have had neither sleep nor food a guest-house shall be
made ready: there you shall sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn there is no rest yet for the weary the men of
rohan must ride forth today and we will ride with them axe sword and bow we
did not bring them to rest against your wall lord
of the mark and i promised éomer that my sword and his should be drawn
together
now indeed there is hope of victory said éomer
hope yes said gandalf but isengard is strong and other perils draw
ever nearer do not delay théoden when we are gone lead your
people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in the hills
nay gandalf said the king you do not know your own skill in healing it
shall not be so i myself will go to war to fall in the front of the battle if
it must be thus shall i sleep better
then even the defeat of rohan will be glorious in song said aragorn the
armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying: the lord of the mark
will ride forth eorlingas
but your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i will take thought for that ere i go answered théoden here comes
my counsellor
at that moment háma came again from the hall behind him cringing
between two other men came gríma the wormtongue his face was very
white his eyes blinked in the sunlight háma knelt and presented to théoden
a long sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems here
lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said it was found in his
chest loth was he to render up the keys many other things are there which men
have missed
you lie said wormtongue and this sword your master himself gave into my
keeping
and he now requires it of you again said théoden does that
displease you
assuredly not lord said wormtongue i care for you and yours as best i
may but do not weary yourself or tax too heavily your strength let others
deal with these irksome guests your meat is about to be set on the board will
you not go to it
i will said théoden and let food for my guests be set on the
board beside me the host rides today send the heralds forth let them summon
all who dwell nigh every man and strong lad able to bear arms all who have
horses let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour
from noon
dear lord cried wormtongue it is as i feared this wizard has bewitched
you are none to be left to defend the golden hall of your fathers and all your
treasure none to guard the lord of the mark
if this is bewitchment said théoden it seems to me more wholesome
than your whisperings your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on all
fours like a beast no not one shall be left not even gríma gríma
shall ride too go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lord whined wormtongue grovelling on the ground have pity on one
worn out in your service send me not from your side i at least will stand by
you when all others have gone do not send your
faithful gríma away
you have my pity said théoden and i do not send you from my side
i go myself to war with my men i bid you come with me and prove your faith
wormtongue looked from face to face in his eyes was the hunted look of a
beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies he licked his lips with a
long pale tongue such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the house of
eorl old though he be he said but those who truly love him would spare his
failing years yet i see that i come too late others whom the death of my lord
would perhaps grieve less have already persuaded him if i cannot undo their
work hear me at least in this lord one who knows your mind and honours your
commands should be left in edoras appoint a faithful
steward let your counsellor gríma keep all things till your return-and i
pray that we may see it though no wise man will deem it hopeful
éomer laughed and if that plea does not excuse you from war most
noble wormtongue he said what office of less honour would you accept
to carry a sack of meal up into the mountains-if any man would trust you with
it
nay éomer you do not fully understand the mind of master
wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing glance upon him he is bold and
cunning even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw hours of my
precious time he has wasted already down snake he said suddenly in a
terrible voice down on your belly how long is it since saruman bought you
what was the promised price when all the men were dead you were to pick your
share of the treasure and take the woman you desire too long have you watched
her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
éomer grasped his sword that i knew already he muttered for that
reason i would have slain him before forgetting the law of the hall but
there are other reasons he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him with his
hand
éowyn is safe now he said but you wormtongue you have done what
you could for your true master some reward you have earned at least yet
saruman is apt to overlook his bargains i should advise you to go quickly and
remind him lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips said gandalf
i do not lie see théoden here is a snake with safety you cannot take
it with you nor can you leave it behind to slay it would be just but it was
not always as it now is once it was a man and did you service in its fashion
give him a horse and let him go at once wherever he chooses by his
choice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue said théoden this is your choice: to
ride with me to war and let us see in battle whether you are true or to go
now whither you will but then if ever we meet again i shall not be
merciful
slowly wormtongue rose he looked at them with half-closed eyes last of all
he scanned théodens face and opened his mouth as if to speak then
suddenly he drew himself up his hands worked his eyes glittered such
malice was in them that men stepped back from him he bared his teeth and then
with a hissing breath he spat before the kings feet and darting to one side
he fled down the stair
after him said théoden see that he does no harm to any
but do not hurt him or hinder him give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said éomer
one of the guards ran down the stair another went to the well at the foot of
the terrace and in his helm drew water with it he washed clean the stones that
wormtongue had defiled
now my guests come said théoden come and take such refreshment
as haste allows
they passed back into the great house already they heard below them in the
town the heralds crying and the war-horns blowing for the king was to ride
forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and
assembled
at the kings board sat éomer and the four guests and there also
waiting upon the king was the lady éowyn they ate and drank swiftly the
others were silent while théoden questioned gandalf concerning saruman
how far back his treachery goes who can guess said gandalf he was not
always evil once i do not doubt that he was the friend of rohan and even when
his heart grew colder he found you useful still but for long now he has
plotted your ruin wearing the mask of friendship until he was ready in those
years wormtongues task was easy and all that you did was swiftly known in
isengard for your land was open and strangers came and went and ever
wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your thought chilling your
heart weakening your limbs while others watched and could do nothing for your
will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the mask was torn for those who
would see after that wormtongue played dangerously always seeking to delay
you to prevent your full strength being gathered he was crafty: dulling mens
wariness or working on their fears as served the occasion do you not remember
how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on a wildgoose chase
northward when the immediate peril was westward he persuaded you to forbid
éomer to pursue the raiding orcs if éomer had not defied
wormtongues voice speaking with your mouth those orcs would have
reached isengard by now bearing a great prize not indeed that prize which
saruman desires above all else but at the least two members of my company
sharers of a secret hope of which even to you lord i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think of what they might now be suffering or what saruman might now
have learned to our destruction
i owe much to éomer said théoden faithful heart may have
forward tongue say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth may wear
a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said théoden most of all i owe
to you my guest once again you have come in time i would give you a gift ere
we go at your own choosing you have only to name aught that is mine i reserve
now only my sword
whether i came in time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf but as for
your gift lord i will choose one that will fit my need: swift and sure give
me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it but now shall
ride him into great hazard setting silver against black: i would not risk
anything that is not my own and already there is a bond of love between us
you choose well said théoden and i give him now gladly yet it is
a great gift there is none like to shadowfax in him one of the mighty
steeds of old has returned none such shall return again and to you my other
guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armoury swords you do not
need but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers
out of gondor choose from these ere we go and may they serve you well
now men came bearing raiment of war from the kings hoard and they arrayed
aragorn and legolas in shining mail helms too they chose and round shields:
their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems green and red and white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed no coat of rings even if one had been
found to match his stature for there was no hauberk in the hoards of edoras of
better make than his short corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north but
he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head and a
small shield he also took it bore the running horse white upon green that was
the emblem of the house of eorl
may it keep you well said théoden it
was made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
gimli bowed i am proud lord of the mark to bear your device he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
it may well be so said théoden
the king now rose and at once éowyn came forward bearing wine ferthu
théoden hál she said receive now this cup and drink
in happy hour health be with thee at thy going and coming
théoden drank from the cup and she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him and her
eyes were shining and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled but as he
took the cup his hand met hers and he knew that she trembled at the
touch hail aragorn son of arathorn she said hail lady of rohan he
answered but his face now was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors there the
guards awaited him and heralds stood and all the lords and chiefs were
gathered together that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be my last riding said théoden
i have no child théodred my son is slain i name éomer my
sister-son to be my heir if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you
will but to some one i must now entrust my people that i leave behind to rule
them in my place which of you will stay
no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do my people trust
in the house of eorl answered háma
but éomer i cannot spare nor would he stay said the king and he
is the last of that house
i said not éomer answered háma and he is not the last
there is éowyn daughter of éomund his sister she is fearless
and high-hearted all love her let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we
are gone
it shall be so said théoden let the heralds announce to the folk
that the lady éowyn will lead them
then the king sat upon a seat before his doors
and éowyn knelt before him and received from him a sword and a fair
corslet farewell sister-daughter he said dark is the hour yet maybe we
shall return to the golden hall but in dunharrow the people may long defend
themselves and if the battle go ill thither will come all who escape speak
not so she answered a year shall i endure for every day that passes until
your return but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said fear not not west but east does our
doom await us
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him the others
followed aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate alone éowyn
stood before the doors of the house at the stairs head the sword was
set upright before her and her hands were laid upon the hilt she was clad now
in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimli walked with legolas his axe on his shoulder well at last we set
off he said men need many words before deeds my axe is restless in my
hands though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to
it nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me how shall i come to the
battle i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i guess said legolas yet doubtless gandalf will
gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself an axe
is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman it is orc-necks i would hew not shave the
scalps of men said gimli patting the haft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men old and young all ready in the
saddle more than a thousand were there mustered their spears were like a
springing wood loudly and joyously they shouted as
théoden came forth some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane
and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas gimli stood ill at ease
frowning but éomer came up to him leading his horse
hail gimli glóins son he cried i have not had time to
learn gentle speech under your rod as you promised but shall we not put aside
our quarrel at least i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i will forget my wrath for a while éomer son of éomund said
gimli but if ever you chance to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then
you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendship will end
so be it said éomer but until that time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride with me i beg gandalf will be at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased i will gladly go with you
if legolas my comrade may ride beside us
it shall he so said éomer legolas
upon my left and aragorn upon my right and none will dare to stand before us
where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horses name and far away he tossed
his head and neighed and turning sped towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible even so would it
appear said éomer as the great horse ran
up until he stood before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said théoden but hearken all
here now i name my guest gandalf greyhame wisest of counsellors most welcome
of wanderers a lord of the mark a chieftain of the eorlingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you théoden king said gandalf then suddenly he threw back
his grey cloak and cast aside his hat and leaped to horseback he wore no helm
nor mail his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white robes shone dazzling
in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted forth eorlingas
the trumpets sounded the horses reared and
neighed spear clashed on shield then the king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of rohan rode thundering
into the west far over the plain éowyn saw the glitter of their spears
as she stood still alone before the doors of the silent house
 
the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras and the light of it
was in their eyes turning all the rolling fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way north-westward along the foot-hills of the white
mountains and this they followed up and down in a green country crossing
small swift streams by many fords far ahead and to their right the misty
mountains loomed ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by the sun
went slowly down before them evening came behind
the host rode on need drove them fearing to come too late they rode with
all the speed they could pausing seldom swift and enduring were the steeds of
rohan but there were many leagues to go forty leagues and more it was as a
bird flies from edoras to the fords of the isen where they hoped to find the
kings men that held back the hosts of saruman
night closed about them at last they halted to make their camp they had
ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain yet more
than half their journey lay still before them in a great circle under the
starry sky and the waxing moon they now made their bivouac they lit no fires
for they were uncertain of events but they set a ring of mounted guards about
them and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in the folds of the
land the slow night passed without tidings or alarm at dawn the horns sounded
and within an hour they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was in the air it was hot
for the season of the year the rising sun was hazy and behind it following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness as of a great storm moving out
of the east and away in the north-west there seemed to be another darkness
brooding about the feet of the misty mountains a shadow that crept down slowly
from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside éomer you have the
keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas he said and they can tell a
sparrow from a finch a league off tell me can you sec anything away yonder
towards isengard
many miles lie between said legolas gazing thither and shading his eyes
with his long hand i can see a darkness there are shapes moving in it great
shapes far away upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell it
is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a veiling shadow that some
power lays upon the land and it marches slowly down stream it is as if the
twilight under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills
and behind us comes a very storm of mordor said gandalf it will be a
black night
as the second day of their riding drew on the heaviness in the air
increased in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre
canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light the sun went
down blood-red in a smoking haze the spears of the riders were tipped with
fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of
thrihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the white
mountains three jagged horns staring at the sunset in the last red glow men in
the vanguard saw a black speck a horseman riding back towards them they halted
awaiting him
he came a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield slowly he climbed
from his horse and stood there a while gasping at length he spoke is éomer
here he asked you come at last but too late and with too little strength
things have gone evilly since théodred fell we were driven back
yesterday over the isen with great loss many perished at the crossing then at
night fresh forces came over the river against our camp all isengard must be
emptied and saruman has armed the wild hillmen and herd-folk of dunland
beyond the rivers and these also he loosed upon us we were overmastered the
shield-wall was broken erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gather towards his fastness in helms deep the rest are scattered
where is éomer tell him there is no hope ahead he should return to
edoras before the wolves of isengard come there théoden had sat silent
hidden from the mans sight behind his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he said i am here the last host of the
eorlingas has ridden forth it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder he drew himself up then he
knelt offering his notched sword to the king command me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought-
you thought i remained in meduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war but a west wind has shaken the boughs said théoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride to the help of erkenbrand
while théoden was speaking gandalf rode a short way ahead and he sat
there alone gazing north to isengard and west to the setting sun now he came
back
ride théoden he said ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in the plain i must leave you for a while shadowfax
must bear me now on a swift errand turning to aragorn and éomer and the
men of the kings household he cried: keep well the lord of the mark till i
return await me at helms gate farewell
he spoke a word to shadowfax and like an arrow from the bow the great horse
sprang away even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the sunset a
wind over the grass a shadow that fled and passed from sight snowmane snorted
and reared eager to follow but only a swift bird on the wing could have
overtaken him
what does that mean said one of the guard to háma
that gandalf greyhame has need of haste answered háma ever he
goes and comes unlooked-for:
wormtongue were he here would not find it hard to explain said the other
true enough said háma but for myself i will wait until i see
gandalf again
maybe you will wait long said the other
the host turned away now from the road to the fords of isen and bent their
course southward night fell and still they rode on the hills drew near but
the tall peaks of thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening sky still
some miles away on the far side of the westfold vale lay a green coomb a
great bay in the mountains out of which a gorge opened in the hills men of
that land called it helms deep after a hero of old wars who had made his
refuge there ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under the
shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow-haunted cliffs rose like mighty towers on
either side shutting out the light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there was a heel of rock thrust
outward by the northern cliff there upon its spur stood high walls of ancient
stone and within them was a lofty tower men said that in the far-off days of
the glory of gondor the sea-kings had built here this fastness with the hands of
giants the hornburg it was called for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed
in the deep behind as if armies long-forgotten were issuing to war from caves
beneath the hills a wall too the men of old had made from the hornburg to the
southern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge beneath it by a wide culvert
the deeping-stream passed out about the feet of the hornrock it wound and
flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore sloping gently
down from helms gate to helms dike thence it fell into the deeping-coomb and
out into the westfold vale there in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand
master of westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt as the days darkened
with threat of war being wise he had repaired the wall and made the fastness
strong
the riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the coomb when
cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front out of the
darkness arrows whistled swiftly a scout rode back and reported that
wolf-riders were abroad in the valley and that a host of orcs and wild men were
hurrying southward from the fords of isen and seemed to be making for helms
deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither said the
scout and we have met scattered companies going this way and that
leaderless what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know it is likely that
he will be overtaken ere he can reach helms gate if he has not already
perished
has aught been seen of gandalf asked théoden
yes lord many have seen an old man in white upon a horse passing hither
and thither over the plains like wind in the grass some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nightfall towards isengard some say also that
wormtongue was seen earlier going northward with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him
said théoden nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors the old and
the new but in this need we have no better choice than to go on as gandalf
said to helms gate whether erkenbrand be there or no is it known how great
is the host that comes from the north
it is very great said the scout he that flies counts every foeman twice
yet i have spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that the main strength
of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said éomer let
us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness there are
caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie hid and secret ways lead thence up
on to the hills
trust not to secret ways said the king saruman has long spied out this
land still in that place our defence may last long let us go
aragorn and legolas went now with éomer in the van on through the
dark night they rode ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed
southward higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains
feet they found few of the enemy before them here and there they came upon
roving bands of orcs but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it will not be long i fear said éomer ere the coming of
the kings host will be known to the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever
captain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew behind them now they could hear borne over the dark
the sound of harsh singing they had climbed far up into the deeping-coomb when
they looked back then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon the
black fields behind scattered like red flowers or winding up from the lowlands
in long flickering lines here and there a larger blaze leapt up
it is a great host and follows us hard said aragorn
they bring fire said théoden and they are burning as they come
rick cot and tree this was a rich vale and had many homesteads alas for my
folk
would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of
the mountains said aragorn it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further said éomer not far ahead now lies
helms dike an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs
below helms gate there we can turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend the dike said théoden it is a mile
long or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if we are pressed said éomer
there was neither star nor moon when the riders came to the breach in the
dike where the stream from above passed out and the road beside it ran down
from the hornburg the rampart loomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond
a dark pit as they rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate
éomer answered i éomer son of éomund speak
this is good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel hasten the enemy is
on your heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left many men to hold helms
gate and more had since escaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot said gamling an old man
the leader of those that watched the dike but most of them have seen too many
winters as i have or too few as my sons son here what news of erkenbrand
word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all that is left of the
best riders of westfold but he has not come
i fear that he will not come now said
éomer our scouts have gained no news of him and the enemy fills all
the valley behind us
i would that he had escaped said théoden he was a mighty man in
him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhand but we cannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls are you well stored we bring
little provision for we rode forth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are three parts of the folk of westfold
old and young children and women said gamling but great store of food and
many beasts and their fodder have also been gathered there
that is well said éomer they are burning or despoiling all that
is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for our goods at helms gate they will pay a high
price said gamling
the king and his riders passed on before the causeway that crossed the
stream they dismounted in a long file they led their horses up the ramp and
passed within the gates of the hornburg there they were welcomed again with joy
and renewed hope for now there were men enough to man both the burg and the
barrier wall
quickly éomer set his men in readiness the king and the men of his
household were in the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold-men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind it éomer arrayed most
of the strength that he had for here the defence seemed more doubtful if the
assault were determined and in great force the horses were led far up the deep
under such guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick that four men could walk
abreast along the top sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could
look here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the
outer court of the hornburg three flights of steps led also up on to the wall
from the deep behind but in front it was smooth and the great stones of it
were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints and at
the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall legolas sat above
on the parapet fingering his bow and peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stamping on the stones ever my
heart rises as we draw near the mountains there is good rock here this country
has tough bones i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike give me a
year and a hundred of my kin and i would make this a place that armies would
break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas but you are a dwarf and dwarves are
strange folk i do not like this place and i shall like it no more by the light
of day but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to have you standing nigh with
your stout legs and your hard axe i wish there were more of your kin among us
but even more would i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwood we shall need
them the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there are too few
here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli indeed it is time for sleep sleep i
feel the need of it as never i thought any dwarf could riding is tiring work
yet my axe is restless in my hand give me a row of orc-necks and room to swing
and all weariness will fall from me
a slow time passed far down in the valley scattered fires still burned the
hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now their torches could be seen
winding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screams and the fierce battle-cries of men
broke out flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the
breach then they scattered and vanished men came galloping back over the field
and up the ramp to the gate of the hornburg the rearguard of the westfolders
had been driven in
the enemy is at hand they said we loosed every arrow that we had and
filled the dike with orcs but it will not halt them long already they are
scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants but we have taught them
not to carry torches
it was now past midnight the sky was utterly dark and the stillness of the
heavy air foreboded storm suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills for a staring moment the
watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and the dike lit with white
light: it was boiling and crawling with black shapes some squat and broad some
tall and grim with high helms and sable shields hundreds and hundreds more
were pouring over the dike and through the breach the dark tide flowed up to
the walls from cliff to cliff thunder rolled in the valley rain came lashing
down
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements and fell
clinking and glancing on the stones some found a mark the assault on helms
deep had begun but no sound or challenge was heard within no answering arrows
came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness then the orcs screamed
waving spear and sword and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood
revealed upon the battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked out as it
seemed to them upon a great field of dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
brazen trumpets sounded the enemy surged forward some against the deeping
wall other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg-gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunland fells a
moment they hesitated and then on they came the lightning flashed and blazoned
upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of isengard was seen: they reached
the summit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them and a hail of
stones they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again broke and
charged again and each time like the incoming sea they halted at a higher
point again trumpets rang and a press of roaring men leaped forth they held
their great shields above them like a roof while in their midst they bore two
trunks of mighty trees behind them orc-archers crowded sending a hail of darts
against the bowmen on the walls they gained the gates the trees swung by
strong arms smote the timbers with a rending boom if any man fell crushed by
a stone hurtling from above two others sprang to take his place again and
again the great rams swung and crashed
éomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall they
heard the roar of voices and the thudding of the rams and then in a sudden
flash of light they beheld the peril of the gates
come said aragorn this is the hour when we draw swords together
running like fire they sped along the wall and up the steps and passed
into the outer court upon the rock as they ran they gathered a handful of stout
swordsmen there was a small postern-door that opened in an angle of the
burg-wall on the west where the cliff stretched
out to meet it on that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate
between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock together éomer and
aragorn sprang through the door their men close behind the swords flashed from
the sheath as one
gúthwinë cried éomer gúthwinë for the
mark
andúril cried aragorn andúril for the dúnedain
charging from the side they hurled themselves upon the wild men andúril
rose and fell gleaming with white fire a shout went up from wall and tower:
andúril andúril goes to war the blade that was broken shines
again
dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight but the wall of
their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke and they were swept away
hewn down or cast over the rock into the stony stream below the orc-archers
shot wildly and then fled
for a moment éomer and aragorn halted before the gates the thunder
was rumbling in the distance now the lightning flickered still far off among
the mountains in the south a keen wind was blowing from the north again
the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeped out and above the hills of
the coomb-side the westering moon rode glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates their great
hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them said éomer
look he pointed to the causeway already a great press of orcs and men were
gathering again beyond the stream arrows whined and skipped on the stones
about them come we must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and
beam across the gates within come now
they turned and ran at that moment some dozen orcs that had
lain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet and came silently and
swiftly behind two flung themselves to the ground at éomers heels
tripped him and in a moment they were on top of him but a small dark figure
that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout:
baruk khazâd khazâd ai-mênu an axe swung and
swept back two orcs fell headless the rest fled
éomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones when all were safe within éomer turned: i
thank you gimli son of glóin he said i did not know that you were
with us in the sortie but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company how
came you there
i followed you to shake off sleep said gimli but i looked on the hillmen
and they seemed over large for me so i sat beside a stone to see your
sword-play
i shall not find it easy to repay you said éomer
there may be many a chance ere the night is over laughed the dwarf but i
am content till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe he had returned to his place on the wall
two said legolas i have done better though now i must grope for spent
arrows all mine are gone yet i make my tale twenty at the least but that is
only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark the enemy before
them seemed to have grown rather than diminished still more were pressing up
from the valley through the breach the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief
respite the assault on the gates was redoubled against the deeping wall the
hosts of isengard roared like a sea orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet
from end to end ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling them back hundreds of long ladders were lifted
up many were cast down in ruin but many more replaced them and orcs sprang up
them like apes in the dark forests of the south before the walls foot the dead
and broken were piled like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary all their arrows
were spent and every shaft was shot their swords were notched and their
shields were riven three times aragorn and éomer rallied them and three
times andúril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind orcs had crept like rats through the
culvert through which the stream flowed out there they had gathered in the
shadow of the cliffs until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men
of the defence had rushed to the walls top then they sprang out already some
had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses fighting with
the guards
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs
khazâd khazâd he soon had work enough
ai-oi he shouted the orcs are behind the wall ai-oi come legolas
there are enough for us both khazâd ai-mênu
gamling the old looked down from the hornburg hearing the great voice of the
dwarf above all the tumult the orcs are in the deep he cried helm helm
forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped down the stair from the rock with many
men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them ere
long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge and all were slain or
driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the
hidden caves
twenty-one cried gimli he hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last orc
before his feet now my count passes master legolas again
we must stop this rat-hole said gamling dwarves are said to be cunning
folk with stone lend us your aid master
we do not shape stone with battle-axes nor with our finger-nails said
gimli but i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to
hand and under gimlis direction the westfold-men blocked up the inner end of
the culvert until only a narrow outlet remained then the deeping-stream
swollen by the rain churned and fretted in its choked path and spread slowly
in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above said gimli come gamling let us see how things
go on the wall
he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and éomer the elf was
whetting his long knife there was for a while a lull in the assault
since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
twenty-one said gimli
good said legolas but my count is now two dozen it has been knife-work
up here
éomer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords away on the
left the crash and clamour of the battle on the rock rose loud again but the
hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea its gates lay in ruin but
over the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon now sloping behind the
western hills that enclosed the valley this is a night as long as years he
said how long will the day tarry
dawn is not far off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him but
dawn will not help us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men said aragorn
but these creatures of isengard these half-orcs and goblin-men that the
foul craft of saruman has bred they will not quail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills do you not hear their voices
i hear them said éomer but they are only the scream of birds and
the bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling i know
that tongue it is an ancient speech of men and once was spoken in many western
valleys of the mark hark they hate us and they are glad for our doom seems
certain to them the king the king they cry we will take their king death
to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to the robbers of the north
such names they have for us not in half a thousand years have they forgotten
their grievance that the lords of gondor gave the mark to eorl the young and
made alliance with him that old hatred saruman has
inflamed they are fierce folk when roused they will not give way now for dusk
or dawn until théoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn is it not said that
no foe has ever taken the hornburg if men defended it
so the minstrels say said éomer
then let us defend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets then there was a crash and
a flash of flame and smoke the waters of the deeping-stream poured out hissing
and foaming: they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn they have crept in the culvert again
while we talked and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet elendil
elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the breach but even as he did
so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements over the wall and
under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of
sand the defence was swept away some of the riders were driven back further
and further into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way step by step
towards the caves others cut their way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to
the rock and the rear-gate of the hornburg near the bottom stood aragorn in
his hand still andúril gleamed and the terror of the sword for a while
held back the enemy as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up
towards the gate behind on the upper steps knelt legolas his bow was bent but
one gleaned arrow was all that he had left and he peered out now ready to
shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair
all who can have now got safe within aragorn he called come back
aragorn turned and sped up the stair but as he ran he stumbled in his
weariness at once his enemies leapt forward up came the orcs yelling with
their long arms stretched out to seize him the foremost fell with legolas last
arrow in his throat but the rest sprang over him then a great boulder cast
from the outer wall above crashed down upon the stair and hurled them back
into the deep aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
things go ill my friends he said wiping the sweat from his brow with his
arm
ill enough said legolas but not yet hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli
i do not know said aragorn i last saw him fighting on the ground behind
the wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evil news said legolas
he is stout and strong said aragorn let us hope that he will escape back
to the caves there he would be safe for a while safer than we such a refuge
would be to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas but i wish that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine
if he wins back to the caves he will pass your count again laughed
aragorn never did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and seek some arrows said legolas would that this night would
end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passed into the citadel there to his dismay he learned that
éomer had not reached the hornburg
nay he did not come to the rock said one of the westfold-men i last saw
him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep gamling was
with him and the dwarf but i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted to a high chamber in
the tower there stood the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon
the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken lord and all the defence swept away but many
have escaped hither to the rock
is éomer here
no lord but many of your men retreated into the deep and some say that
éomer was amongst them in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and
come within the caves what hope they may have then i do not know
more than we good provision it is said and the air is wholesome there
because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above none can force an
entrance against determined men they may hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn they have
a blasting fire and with it they took the wall if they cannot come in the
caves they may seal up those that are inside but now we must turn all our
thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prison said théoden if i could have set a spear
in rest riding before my men upon the field maybe i could have felt again the
joy of battle and so ended but i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the mark said
aragorn more hope we have to defend you in the hornburg than in edoras or
even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen to assault said théoden
but now my heart is doubtful the world changes and all that once was strong
now proves unsure how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such
reckless hate had i known that the strength of isengard was grown so great
maybe l should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of
gandalf his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king but i will not end here taken
like an old badger in a trap snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard
are in the inner court when dawn comes i will bid men sound helms horn and i
will ride forth will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe we shall
cleave a road or make such an end as will be worth a song-if any be left to
sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed round all their
circuit enheartening the men and lending aid wherever the assault was hot
legolas went with him blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones
grappling-hooks were hurled and ladders raised again and again the orcs gained
the summit of the outer wall and again the defenders cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of the darts of the
enemy as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale then he raised his
empty hand palm outward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jeered come down come down they cried if you wish
to speak to us come down bring out your king we are the fighting uruk-hai we
will fetch him from his hole if he does not come bring out your skulking
king
the king stays or comes at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing here they answered why do you look out do you
wish to see the greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk-hai
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeered we are the uruk-hai: we do not stop the
fight for night or day for fair weather or for storm we come to kill by sun
or moon what of the dawn
none knows what the new day shall bring him said aragorn get you gone
ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried this is no
parley you have nothing to say
i have still this to say answered aragorn no enemy has yet taken the
hornburg depart or not one of you will be spared not one will be left alive
to take back tidings to the north you do not know your peril
so great a power and royalty was revealed in aragorn as he stood there alone
above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies that many of the wild men
paused and looked back over their shoulders to the valley and some looked up
doubtfully at the sky but the orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail of
darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire the archway of the gate above which he
had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust the barricade
was scattered as if by a thunderbolt aragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about it yelled preparing to charge
a murmur arose behind them like a wind in the distance and it grew to a
clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn the orcs upon the rock
hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back and then sudden and
terrible from the tower above the sound of the great horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled many of the orcs cast themselves on their
faces and covered their ears with their claws back from the deep the echoes
came blast upon blast as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood but
on the walls men looked up listening with wonder for the echoes did not die
ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills nearer now and louder they
answered one to another blowing fierce and free
helm helm the riders shouted helm is arisen and comes back to war helm
for théoden king
and with that shout the king came his horse was white as snow golden was
his shield and his spear was long at his right hand was aragorn elendils
heir behind him rode the lords of the house of eorl the young light sprang in
the sky night departed
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great noise they charged down from the
gates they roared over the causeway they swept and they drove through the
hosts of isengard as a wind among grass behind them from the deep came the
stern cries of men issuing from the caves driving forth the enemy out poured
all the men that were left upon the rock and ever the sound of blowing horns
echoed in the hills
on they rode the king and his companions captains and champions fell or
fled before them neither orc nor man withstood them their backs were to the
swords and spears of the riders and their faces to the valley they cried and
wailed for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the rising of the day
so king théoden rode from helms gate and clove his path to the great
dike there the company halted light grew bright about them shafts of
the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears but they
sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping-coomb
the land had changed where before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping the ever-mounting hills there now a forest loomed great trees bare
and silent stood rank on rank with tangled bough and hoary head their
twisted roots were buried in the long green grass darkness was under them
between the dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two open furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror of the king and in
terror of the trees they streamed down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb seeking to
escape upon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys side upon the left
from the west their final doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad in white shining in the
rising sun over the low hills the horns were sounding behind him hastening
down the long slopes were a thousand men on foot their swords were in their
hands amid them strode a man tall and strong his shield was red as he came to
the valleys brink he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing
blast
erkenbrand the riders shouted erkenbrand
behold the white rider cried aragorn gandalf is come again
mithrandir mithrandir said legolas this is wizardry indeed come i
would look on this forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and that turning from fear to
fear again the horn sounded from the tower down through the breach of the dike
charged the kings company down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of
westfold down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the
mountains the white rider was upon them and the terror of his coming filled
the enemy with madness the wild men fell on their faces before him the orcs
reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear like a black smoke
driven by a mounting wind they fled wailing they passed under the waiting
shadow of the trees and from that shadow none ever came again
 
so it was that in the light of a fair morning king théoden and gandalf
the white rider met again upon the green grass beside the deeping-stream there
was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the elf and erkenbrand of
westfold and the lords of the golden house about them were gathered the
rohirrim the riders of the mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory and
their eyes were turned towards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout and down from the dike came those who had
been driven back into the deep there came gamling
the old and éomer son of éomund and beside them walked gimli the
dwarf he had no helm and about his head was a linen band stained with blood
but his voice was loud and strong
forty-two master legolas he cried alas my axe is notched: the
forty-second had an iron collar on his neck how is it with you
you have passed my score by one answered legolas but i do not grudge you
the game so glad am i to see you on your legs
welcome éomer sister-son said théoden now that i see you
safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said éomer the dark night has passed and
day has come again but the day has brought strange tidings he turned and
gazed in wonder first at the wood and then at gandalf once more you
come in the hour of need unlooked-for he said
unlooked-for said gandalf i said that i would return and meet you here
but you did not name the hour nor foretell the manner of your coming
strange help you bring you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white
that may be but if so i have not shown it yet i have but given good
counsel in peril and made use of the speed of shadowfax your own valour has
done more and the stout legs of the westfold-men marching through the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder some glanced darkly
at the wood and passed their hands over their brows as if they thought their
eyes saw otherwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily the trees he said nay i see the wood
as plainly as do you but that is no deed of mine it is a thing beyond the
counsel of the wise better than my design and better even than my hope the
event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said théoden not sarumans
that is plain is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet to learn
it is not wizardry but a power far older said gandalf: a power that
walked the earth ere elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn

when young was mountain under moon

ere ring was made or wrought was woe

it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said théoden
if you would learn that you should come with me to isengard  answered
gandalf
to isengard they cried
yes said gandalf i shall return to isengard and those who will may come
with me there we may see strange things
but there are not men enough in the mark not if they were all gathered
together and healed of wounds and weariness to assault the
stronghold of saruman said théoden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf i shall not stay there long
my way lies now eastward look for me in edoras ere the waning of the moon
nay said théoden in the dark hour before dawn i doubted
but we will not part now i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as may be now said gandalf and
since he has done you great injury it would be fitting if you were there but
how soon and how swiftly will you ride
my men are weary with battle said the king and i am weary also for i
have ridden far and slept little alas my old age is not feigned nor due only
to the whisperings of wormtongue it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure
not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandalf we will
journey under the shadow of evening it is as well for it is my counsel that
all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be henceforth but do not
command many men to go with you théoden we
go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses and he sent
them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the mark and they
bore his summons also bidding all men young and
old to come in haste to edoras there the lord of the mark would hold an
assembly of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon to
ride with him to isengard the king chose éomer and twenty men of his
household with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas and gimli in
spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said it would take
more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorn
the king now returned to the hornburg and slept such a sleep of quiet as he
had not known for many years and the remainder of his chosen company rested
also but the others all that were not hurt or wounded began a great labour
for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted but a great many of the
hillmen had given themselves up and they were afraid and cried for mercy
the men of the mark took their weapons from them and set them to work
help now to repair the evil in which you have joined said erkenbrand and
afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of men and then you shall go free back to your
land for you have been deluded by saruman many of you have got death as the
reward of your trust in him but had you conquered little better would your
wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had told them that the men of
rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two mounds were raised and
beneath them were laid all the riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upon one side and those of
westfold upon the other in a_ grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg lay
háma captain of the kings guard he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the mounds of men not far from
the eaves of the forest and the people were troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning they had little wood
for firing and none would have dared to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great
peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart the work of burial
was then but beginning and théoden mourned for the loss of háma
his captain and cast the first earth upon his grave great injury
indeed has saruman done to me and all this land he said and i will remember
it when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the coomb when
at last théoden and gandalf and their companions rode down from
the dike behind them were gathered a great host both of the riders and of the
people of westfold old and young women and children who had come out from the
caves a song of victory they sang with clear voices and then they fell silent
wondering what would chance for their eyes were on the trees and they feared
them
the riders came to the wood and they halted horse and man they were
unwilling to pass in the trees were grey and menacing and a shadow or a mist
was about them the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like searching
fingers their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strange
monsters and dark caverns opened beneath them but gandalf went forward
leading the company and where the road from the hornburg met the trees they saw
now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs and through it gandalf
passed and they followed him then to their amazement they found that the road
ran on and the deeping-stream beside it and the sky was open above and full of
golden light but on either side the great aisles of the wood were already
wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows and there they heard
the creaking and groaning of boughs and far cries and a rumour of wordless
voices murmuring angrily no orc or other living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse and they kept
close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf i feel a great wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in your ears
yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in silence for a while but legolas was ever glancing from side to
side and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli
had allowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he said and i have seen
many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age i wish that there were leisure now
to walk among them: they have voices and in time i might come to understand
their thought
no no said gimli let us leave them i guess their thought already:
hatred of all that go on two legs and their speech is of crushing and
strangling
not of all that go on two legs said legolas there i think you are wrong
it is orcs that they hate for they do not belong here and know little of elves
and men far away are the valleys where they sprang from the deep dales of
fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
then that is the most perilous wood in middle-earth said gimli i should
be grateful for the part they have played but i do not love them you may think
them wonderful but i have seen a greater wonder in this land more beautiful
than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still full of ft strange
are the ways of men legolas here they have one of the marvels of the northern
world and what do they say of it caves they say caves holes to fly to in
time of war to store fodder in my good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms deep are vast and beautiful there would be an endless pilgrimage of
dwarves merely to gaze at them if such things were known to be aye indeed
they would pay pure gold for a brief glance
and i would give gold to be excused said legolas and double to be let
out if i strayed in
you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli but you speak like
a fool do you think those halls are fair where your king dwells under the hill
in mirkwood and dwarves helped in their making long ago they are but hovels
compared with the caverns i have seen here: immeasurable halls filled with an
everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as fair as
kheled-zâram in the starlight
and legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors
under the echoing domes ah then legolas gems and crystals and veins of
precious ore glint in the polished walls and the light glows through folded
marbles shell-like translucent as the living hands of queen galadriel there
are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose legolas fluted and twisted into
dreamlike forms they spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening
pendants of the roof: wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears
banners pinnacles of suspended palaces still lakes mirror them: a glimmering
world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities such as the
mind of durin could scarce have imagined in his sleep stretch on through
avenues and pillared courts on into the dark recesses where no light can come
and plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the
towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea then evening
comes: they fade and twinkle out the torches pass on into another chamber and
another dream there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome stair beyond stair and still the winding paths lead on
into the mountains heart caves the caverns of helms deep happy was the
chance that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your comfort gimli said the elf
that you may come safe from war and return to see them again but do not tell
all your kindred there seems little left for them to do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to say little: one family of busy dwarves
with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made
no you do not understand said gimli no dwarf could be unmoved by such
loveliness none of durins race would mine those caves for stones or ore not
if diamonds and gold could be got there do you cut down groves of blossoming
trees in the spring-time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering
stone not quarry them with cautious skill tap by tap - a small chip of rock
and no more perhaps in a whole anxious day - so we could work and as the
years went by we should open up new ways and display
far chambers that are still dark glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the
rock and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps as once shone in
khazad-dûm and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain
there since the hills were made and when we desired rest we would let
the night return
you move me gimli said legolas i have never heard you speak like this
before almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves come let us
make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey for a while together you shall visit fangorn with me and then i
will come with you to see helms deep
that would not be the way of return that i should choose said gimli but
i will endure fangorn if i have your promise to come back to the caves and
share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas but alas now we must leave behind both
cave and wood for a while: see we are coming to the end of the trees how far
is it to isengard gandalf
about fifteen leagues as the crows of saruman make it said gandalf: five
from the mouth of deeping-coomb to the fords: and ten more from there to the
gates of isengard but we shall not ride all the way this night
and when we come there what shall we see asked gimli you may know but
i cannot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard i was there at
nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since yet i think that you will
not say that the journey was in vain - not though the glittering caves of
aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the trees and found that they had come to
the bottom of the coomb where the road from helms deep branched going one way
east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen as they rode from
under the eaves of the wood legolas halted and looked back with regret then he
gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he said eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs
i never saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned but legolas started to
ride back
no no cried gimli do as you please in your madness but let me first
get down from this horse i wish to see no eyes stay legolas greenleaf
said gandalf do not go back into the wood not yet now is not your time
even as he spoke there came forward out of the trees three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were twelve feet or more in height their strong bodies
stout as young trees seemed to be clad with raiment or with hide of
close-fitting grey and brown their limbs were long and their hands had many
fingers their hair was stiff and their beards grey-green as moss they gazed
out with solemn eyes but they were not looking at the riders: their eyes were
bent northwards suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and sent
forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn but more musical and various the
calls were answered and turning again the riders saw other creatures of the
same kind approaching striding through the grass they came swiftly from the
north walking like wading herons in their gait but not in their speed for
their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the herons wings the riders
cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands upon their sword-hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf these are but herdsmen they are not
enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke the tall creatures without a glance at
the riders strode into the wood and vanished
herdsmen said théoden where are their flocks what are they
gandalf for it is plain that to you at any rate they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf is it so long since
you listened to tales by the fireside there are children in your land who out
of the twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your question you
have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn forest which in your tongue you call
the entwood did you think that the name was given only in idle fancy nay théoden
it is otherwise: to them you are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to théoden the old are of little count to them and all the
deeds of your house but a small matter
the king was silent ents he said at length out of the shadows of legend
i begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees i think i have lived to
see strange days long we have tended our beasts and our fields built our
houses wrought our tools or ridden away to help in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the world we cared little for
what lay beyond the borders of our land songs we have that tell of these
things but we are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a
careless custom and now the songs have come down among us out of strange
places and walk visible under the sun
you should be glad théoden king said gandalf for not only the
little life of men is now endangered but the life also of those things
which you have deemed the matter of legend you are not without allies even if
you know them not
yet also i should be sad said théoden for however the fortune of
war shall go may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for ever out of middle-earth
it may said gandalf the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been but to such days we are doomed let us now go on with the
journey we have begun
the company turned then away from the coomb and from the wood and took the
road towards the fords legolas followed reluctantly the sun had set already
it had sunk behind the rim of the world but as they rode out from the shadow of
the hills and looked west to the gap of rohan the sky was still red and a
burning light was under the floating clouds dark against it there wheeled and
flew many black-winged birds some passed overhead with mournful cries
returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion-fowl have been busy about the
battle-field said éomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing towards the full and in its cold silver light
the swelling grass-lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea they had ridden for
some four hours from the branching of the roads when they drew near to the
fords long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread in stony shoals
between high grassy terraces borne upon the wind they heard the howling of
wolves their hearts were heavy remembering the many men that had fallen in
battle in this place
the road dipped between rising turf-banks carving its way through the
terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side there were
three lines of flat stepping-stones across the stream and between them fords
for horses that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst the riders
looked down upon the crossings and it seemed strange to them for the fords had
ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water upon stones but now
they were silent the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare waste of
shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreary place said éomer what sickness has
befallen the river many fair things saruman has destroyed: has he
devoured the springs of isen too so it would seem said gandalf
alas said théoden must we pass this way where the carrion-beasts
devour so many good riders of the mark
this is our way said gandalf grievous is the fall of your men but you
shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them it is
with their friends the orcs that they hold their feast: such indeed is the
friendship of their kind come
they rode down to the river and as they came the wolves ceased their howling
and slunk away fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and shadowfax his
horse shining like silver the riders passed over to the islet and glittering
eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
look said gandalf friends have laboured here
and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled ringed with
stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell near this place said gandalf
here let them rest said éomer and
when their spears have rotted and rusted long still may their mound stand and
guard the fords of isen
is this your work also gandalf my friend said théoden you
accomplished much in an evening and a night
with the help of shadowfax - and others said gandalf i rode fast and
far but here beside the mound i will say this for your comfort: many fell in
the battles of the fords but fewer than rumour made them more were scattered
than were slain i gathered together all that i could find some men i sent with
grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand some i set to make this burial they
have now followed your marshal elfhelm i sent him with many riders to edoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against you and his servants
had turned aside from all other errands and gone to helms deep: the lands
seemed empty of enemies yet i feared that wolf-riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheless to meduseld while it was undefended but now i think you need not
fear: you will find your house to welcome your return
and glad shall i be to see it again said théoden though brief
now i doubt not shall be my abiding there
with that the company said farewell to the island and the mound and passed
over the river and climbed the further bank then they rode on glad to have
left the mournful fords as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew
there was an ancient highway that ran down from isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its course beside the river bending with it east and then
north but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of
isengard and these were under the mountain-side in the west of the valley
sixteen miles or more from its mouth this road they followed but they did not
ride upon it for the ground beside it was firm and level covered for many
miles about with short springing turf they rode now more swiftly and by
midnight the fords were nearly five leagues behind then they halted ending
their nights journey for the king was weary they were come to the feet of the
misty mountains and the long arms of nan curunír stretched down to meet
them dark lay the vale before them for the moon had passed into the west and
its light was hidden by the hills but out of the deep shadow of the dale
rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted it caught the rays of the
sinking moon and spread in shimmering billows black and silver over the
starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn one would say that all
the wizards vale was burning
there is ever a fume above that valley in these days said éomer:
but i have never seen aught like this before these are steams rather than
smokes saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us maybe he is boiling
all the waters of isen and that is why the river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing now
let us rest for a while if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a little but late in the night the watchmen cried out and
all awoke the moon was gone stars were shining above but over the ground
there crept a darkness blacker than the night on both sides of the river it
rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf draw no weapons wait and it will pass
you by
a mist gathered about them above them a few stars still glimmered faintly
but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom they were in a
narrow lane between moving towers of shadow voices they heard whisperings and
groanings and an endless rustling sigh the earth shook under them long it
seemed to them that they sat and were afraid but at last the darkness and the
rumour passed and vanished between the mountains arms
away south upon the hornburg in the middle night men heard a great noise as
a wind in the valley and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no one
ventured to go forth but in the morning they went out and were amazed for the
slain orcs were gone and the trees also far down into the valley of the deep
the grass was crushed and trampled brown as if giant herdsmen had pastured
great droves of cattle there but a mile below the dike a huge pit had been
delved in the earth and over it stones were piled into a hill men believed
that the orcs whom they had slain were buried there but whether those who had
fled into the wood were with them none could say for no man ever set foot upon
that hill the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow
there but the strange trees were never seen in deeping-coomb again they had
returned at night and had gone far away to the dark dales of fangorn thus they
were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that night but they saw and heard no
other strange thing save one: the voice of the river beside them suddenly
awoke there was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones and when it had
passed the isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on the light came grey and pale and they did
not see the rising of the sun the air above was heavy with fog and a reek lay
on the land about them they went slowly riding
now upon the highway it was broad and hard and well-tended dimly through the
mists they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left they
had passed into nan curunír the wizards vale that was a sheltered
valley open only to the south once it had been fair and green and
through it the isen flowed already deep and strong before it found the plains
for it was fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills
and all about it there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres
tilled by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley had become a wilderness
of weeds and thorns brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush
and bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed no trees grew there but
among the rank grasses could still be seen the burned and axe-hewn stumps of
ancient groves it was a sad country silent now but for the stony noise of
quick waters smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the
hollows the riders did not speak many doubted in their hearts wondering to
what dismal end their journey led
after they had ridden for some miles the highway became a wide street paved
with great flat stones squared and laid with skill no blade of grass was seen
in any joint deep gutters filled with trickling water ran down on either
side suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them it was black and set upon
it was a great stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long white hand
its finger pointed north not far now they knew that the gates of isengard must
stand and their hearts were heavy but their eyes could not pierce the mists
ahead
beneath the mountains arm within the wizards vale through years uncounted
had stood that ancient place that men called isengard partly it was shaped in
the making of the mountains but mighty works the men of westernesse had wrought
there of old and saruman had dwelt there long and had not been idle
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height accounted by many the
chief of wizards a great ring-wall of stone like towering cliffs stood out
from the shelter of the mountain-side from which it ran and then returned
again one entrance only was there made in it a great arch delved in the
southern wall here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn closed
at either end with mighty doors of iron they were so wrought and poised upon
their huge hinges posts of steel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly one
who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel beheld a plain a
great circle somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured
from rim to rim once it had been green and filled with avenues and groves of
fruitful trees watered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake but
no green thing grew there in the latter days of saruman the roads were paved
with stone-flags dark and hard and beside their borders instead of trees there
marched long lines of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
joined by heavy chains
many houses there were chambers halls and passages cut and tunnelled back
into the walls upon their inner side so that all the open circle was overlooked
by countless windows and dark doors thousands could dwell there workers
servants slaves and warriors with great store of arms wolves were fed and
stabled in deep dens beneath the plain too was bored and delved shafts were
driven deep into the ground their upper ends were covered by low mounds and
domes of stone so that in the moonlight the ring of isengard looked like a
graveyard of unquiet dead for the ground trembled the shafts ran down by many
slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries
store-houses armouries smithies and great furnaces iron wheels revolved
there endlessly and hammers thudded at night plumes of vapour steamed from the
vents lit from beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains there stood a tower of
marvellous shape it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed the ring
of isengard and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of men but riven
from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills a peak and isle
of rock it was black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone
were welded into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns their
pinnacles sharp as the points of spears keen-edged as knives between them was
a narrow space and there upon a floor of polished stone written with strange
signs a man might stand five hundred feet above the plain this was orthanc
the citadel of saruman the name of which had by design or chance a twofold
meaning for in the elvish speech orthanc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong place and wonderful was isengard and long it had been beautiful
and there great lords had dwelt the wardens of gondor upon the west and wise
men that watched the stars but saruman had slowly shaped it to his shifting
purposes and made it better as he thought being deceived-for all those arts
and subtle devices for which he forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he
imagined were his own came but from mordor so that what he made was naught
only a little copy a childs model or a slaves flattery of that vast
fortress armoury prison furnace of great power
barad-dûr the dark tower which suffered no rival and laughed at
flattery biding its time secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength
this was the stronghold of saruman as fame reported it for within living
memory the men of rohan had not passed its gates save perhaps a few such as
wormtongue who came in secret and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand and passed it: and as he
did so the riders saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white it
was stained as with dried blood and looking closer they perceived that its
nails were red unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they
followed him all about them now as if there had been a sudden flood wide
pools of water lay beside the road filling the hollows and rills went
trickling down among the stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they came and saw that
beyond him the mists had cleared and a pale sunlight shone the hour of noon
had passed they were come to the doors of isengard
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground and all about stone
cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards was scattered far and wide
or piled in ruinous heaps the great arch still stood but it opened now upon a
roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare and through the cliff-like walls on
either side great rents and breaches had been torn their towers were beaten
into dust if the great sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with
storm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron in which
there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars chests and casks and
broken gear twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the
flood but all the roads were drowned far off it seemed half veiled in
winding cloud there loomed the island rock still dark and tall unbroken by
the storm the tower of orthanc stood pale waters lapped about its feet
the king and all his company sat silent on their horses marvelling
perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown but how they could not
guess and now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubble-heap and suddenly they were
aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease grey-clad hardly to be
seen among the stones there were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside
them as if they had just eaten well and now rested from their labour one
seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms behind his head leaned
back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings
of thin blue smoke
for a moment théoden and éomer and all his men stared at them
in wonder amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest
sight but before the king could speak the small smoke-breathing figure became
suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist he
sprang to his feet a young man he looked or like one though not much more
than half a man in height his head of brown curling hair was uncovered but he
was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions
of gandalf had worn when they rode to edoras he
bowed very low putting his hand upon his breast then seeming not to observe
the wizard and his friends he turned to éomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said we are the doorwardens meriadoc
son of saradoc is my name and my companion who alas is overcome with
weariness - here he gave the other a dig with his foot - is peregrin son of
paladin of the house of took far in the north is our home the lord saruman is
within but at the moment he is closeted with one wormtongue or doubtless he
would be here to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf and was it saruman that ordered you
to guard his damaged doors and watch for the arrival of guests when your
attention could be spared from plate and bottle
no good sir the matter escaped him answered merry gravely he has been
much occupied our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management
of isengard he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words i
have done my best
and what about your companions what about legolas and me cried gimli
unable to contain himself longer you rascals you woolly-footed and wool-pated
truants a fine hunt you have led us two hundred leagues through fen and
forest battle and death to rescue you and here we find you feasting and
idling-and smoking smoking where did you come by the weed you villains
hammer and tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that if i do not burst it
will be a marvel
you speak for me gimli laughed legolas though i would sooner learn how
they came by the wine
one thing you have not found in your hunting and thats brighter wits
said pippin opening an eye here you find us sitting on a field of victory
amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned
comforts
well-earned said gimli i cannot believe that
the riders laughed it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear
friends said théoden so these are the lost ones of your
company gandalf the days are fated to be filled with marvels already i have
seen many since i left my house and now here before my eyes stand yet another
of the folk of legend are not these the halflings that some among us call the
holbytlan
hobbits if you please lord said pippin
hobbits said théoden your tongue is strangely changed but the
name sounds not unfitting so hobbits no report that i have heard does justice
to the truth
merry bowed and pippin got up and bowed low you are gracious lord or i
hope that i may so take your words he said and here is another marvel i
have wandered in many lands since i left my home and never till now have i
found people that knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out of the north long ago said
théoden but i will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits all
that is said among us is that far away over many hills and rivers live the
halfling folk that dwell in holes in sand-dunes but there are no legends of
their deeds for it is said that they do little and avoid the sight of men
being able to vanish in a twinkling: and they can change their voices to
resemble the piping of birds but it seems that more could be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said théoden i had not heard that they spouted
smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry for it is an art which we have not
practised for more than a few generations it was tobold hornblower of
longbottom in the southfarthing who first grew the true pipe-weed in his
gardens about the year 1070 according to our reckoning how old toby came by
the plant…
you do not know your danger théoden interrupted gandalf these
hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the
table or the small doings of their fathers grandfathers and
great-grandfathers and remoter cousins to the ninth degree if you encourage
them with undue patience some other time would be more fitting for the history
of smoking where is treebeard merry
away on the north side i believe he went to get a drink-of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy at their work - over there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and as they looked they heard a
distant rumbling and rattling as if an avalanche was falling from the
mountain-side far away came a hoom-hom as of horns blowing
triumphantly
and is orthanc then left unguarded asked gandalf
there is the water said merry but quickbeam and some others are watching
it not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there said legolas but his arms are at his
sides and he stands as still as a door-tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at any rate have not eaten since
early morning yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be did he leave me no
message or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind
he left a message said merry and i was coming to it but i have been
hindered by many other questions i was to say that if the lord of the mark and
gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find treebeard there and he
will welcome them i may add that they will also find food of the best there it
was discovered and selected by your humble servants he bowed
gandalf laughed that is better he said well théoden will you
ride with me to find treebeard we must go round about but it is not
far when you see treebeard you will learn much for treebeard is fangorn and
the eldest and chief of the ents and when you speak with him you will hear the
speech of the oldest of all living things
i will come with you said théoden farewell my hobbits
may we meet again in my house there you shall sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires as far as you can reckon
them and we will speak also of tobold the old and his herb-lore farewell
the hobbits bowed low so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an
undertone a fine old fellow very polite
 
gandalf and the kings company rode away turning eastward to make the
circuit of the ruined walls of isengard but aragorn gimli and legolas
remained behind leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass they came
and sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we meet again at last where none of us
ever thought to come said aragorn
and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters said
legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there are still many things that i
should like to know the truth of
and there is a great deal too that we want to know about you  said merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old ent but that is not
nearly enough
all in good time said legolas we were the hunters and you should give
an account of yourselves to us first
or second said gimli it would go better after a meal t have a sore
head and it is past mid-day you truants might make amends by finding us some
of the plunder that you spoke of food and drink would pay off some of my score
against you
then you shall have it said pippin will you have it here or in more
comfort in whats left of sarumans guard-house--over there under the arch we
had to picnic out here so as to keep an eye on the road
less than an eye said gimli but i will not go into any orc-house nor
touch orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry we have had enough of orcs ourselves
to last a life-time but there were many other folk in isengard saruman kept
enough wisdom not to trust his orcs he had men to guard his gates: some of his
most faithful servants i suppose anyway they were favoured and got good
provisions
and pipe-weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed but that is another story which can
wait until after lunch
well let us go and have lunch then said the dwarf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the arch and came to a wide
door upon the left at the top of a stair it opened direct into a large
chamber with other smaller doors at the far end and a hearth and chimney at
one side the chamber was hewn out of the stone and it must once have been
dark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel but light came in now
through the broken roof on the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin it cheered us up in the fogs there were
few faggots about and most of the wood we could find was wet but there is a
great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock and
fortunately it has not been blocked a fire is handy i will make you some
toast the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table
and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors store-room in
there and above the woods luckily said pippin as they came back laden with
dishes bowls cups knives and food of various sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the provender master gimli said
merry this is not orc-stuff but man-food as treebeard calls it will you
have wine or beer theres a barrel inside there - very passable and this is
first-rate salted pork or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them
if you like i am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather
interrupted in the last few days i cannot offer you anything to follow but
butter and honey for your bread are you content
indeed yes said gimli the score is much reduced
the three were soon busy with their meal and the two hobbits unabashed set
to a second time we must keep our guests company they said
you are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas but maybe if we
had not arrived you would already have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin we had foul fare with the orcs and
little enough for days before that it seems a long while since we could eat to
hearts content
it does not seem to have done you any harm said aragorn indeed you look
in the bloom of health
aye you do indeed said gimli looking them up and down over the top of
his cup why your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted and i
would swear that you have both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbits
of your age this treebeard at any rate has not starved you
he has not said merry but ents only drink and drink is not enough for
content treebeards draughts may be nourishing but one feels the need of
something solid and even lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have you said legolas ah then
i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him strange songs have
been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many strange tales have been told about that land said aragorn i have
never entered it come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents are - well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very odd he tried a few fumbling words that
trailed off into silence oh well he went on you have seen some at a
distance already-they saw you at any rate and reported that you were on the
way-and you will see many others i expect before you leave here you must form
your own ideas
now now said gimli we are beginning the story in the middle i should
like a tale in the right order starting with that strange day when our
fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry but first-if you have
finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up and then for a little
while we can pretend that we are all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco we have heaps of it he
said and you can all pack as much as you wish when we go we did some
salvage-work this morning pippin and i there are lots of things floating
about it was pippin who found two small barrels washed up out of some cellar
or store-house i suppose when we opened them we found they were filled with
this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it it feels good
and it smells good he said
it is good said merry my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were
the hornblower brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plain how it came here i
cant imagine for sarumans private use i fancy i never knew that it went so
far abroad but it comes in handy now
it would said gimli if i had a pipe to go with it alas i lost mine in
moria or before is there no pipe in all your plunder
no i am afraid not said merry we have not found any not even here in
the guardrooms saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems and i dont think
it would be any use knocking on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of him we
shall have to share pipes as good friends must at a pinch
half a moment said pippin putting his hand inside the breast of his
jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string i keep a treasure or two
near my skin as precious as rings to me heres one: my old wooden pipe and
heres another: an unused one i have carried it a long way though i dont
know why i never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey when my
own ran out but now it comes in useful after all he held up a small pipe with
a wide flattened bowl and handed it to gimli does that settle the score
between us he said settle it cried gimli most noble hobbit it leaves me
deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air to see what the wind and sky are
doing said legolas
we will come with you said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the mists were lifting and floating
away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said aragorn we will sit on
the edge of ruin and talk as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere i feel a
weariness such as i have seldom felt before he wrapped his grey cloak about
him hiding his mail-shirt and stretched out his long legs then he lay back
and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin strider the ranger has come back
he has never been away said aragorn i am
strider and dúnadan too and i belong both to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a while and the sun shone on them slanting into
the valley from among white clouds high in the west legolas lay still looking
up at the sun and sky with steady eyes and singing softly to himself at last
he sat up come now he said time wears on and the mists are blowing away
or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke what of the
tale
well my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all
strung-up in an orc-camp said pippin let me see what is today
the fifth of march in the shire-reckoning said aragorn pippin made some
calculations on his fingers only nine days ago he said1 it seems a year
since we were caught well though half of it was like a bad dream i reckon
that three very horrible days followed merry will correct me if i forget
anything important: i am not going into details: the whips and the filth and
stench and all that it does not bear remembering with that he plunged into an
account of boromirs last fight and the orc-march from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treasures that you let fall said aragorn you will be glad
to have them back he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it
the two sheathed knives
well said merry i never expected to see those again i marked a few orcs
with mine but uglúk took them from us how he glared at first i
thought he was going to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned
him
and here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn i have kept it safe
for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippin it was a wrench to let it go but what else could i
do
nothing else answered aragorn one who cannot cast away a treasure at
need is in fetters you did rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with both hands one might
say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas i wondered if you had grown
wings
unfortunately not said pippin but you did not know about grishnákh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to tell of those last horrible
moments: the pawing hands the hot breath and the dreadful strength of grishnákhs
hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad-dûr lugbúrz as they call it
makes me uneasy said aragorn the dark lord already knew too much and his
servants also and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river
after the quarrel the red eye will be looking towards isengard but saruman at
any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor said merry things began to
go all wrong for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villain or so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said aragorn
let me see said merry: five nights ago-now we come to a part of the story
you know nothing about we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that
night we were at wellinghall one of his ent-houses the next morning we went to
entmoot a gathering of ents that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen
in my life it lasted all that day and the next and we spent the nights with an
ent called quickbeam and then late in the afternoon in the third day of their
moot the ents suddenly blew up it was amazing the forest had felt as tense as
if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it: then all at once it exploded i wish
you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a hundred miles away by now even if he
had had to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bone

we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door
there was very much more a great deal of the song had no words and was like
a music of horns and drums it was very exciting but i thought it was only
marching music and no more just a song - until i got here i know better now
we came down over the last ridge into nan curunír after night
had fallen merry continued it was then that i first had the feeling that the
forest itself was moving behind us i thought i was dreaming an entish dream
but pippin had noticed it too we were both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in "short language"
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they are ents that have become
almost like trees at least to look at they stand here and there in the wood or
under its eaves silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep in the
darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them i believe
there is a great power in them and they seem able to wrap themselves in
shadow: it is difficult to see them moving but they do they can move very
quickly if they are angry you stand still looking at the weather maybe or
listening to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly you find that you are
in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around you they still have
voices and can speak with the ents - that is why they are called huorns
treebeard says - but they have become queer and wild dangerous i should be
terrified of meeting them if there were no true ents about to look after them
well in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper end of
the wizards vale the ents with all their rustling huorns behind we could not
see them of course but the whole air was full of creaking it was very dark a
cloudy night they moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills
and made a noise like a rushing wind the moon did not appear through the
clouds and not long after midnight there was a tall wood all round the north
side of isengard there was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge there was a
light gleaming from a high window in the tower that was all
treebeard and a few more ents crept on right round to within sight of the
great gates pippin and i were with him we were sitting on treebeards
shoulders and i could feel the quivering tenseness in him but even when they
are roused ents can be very cautious and patient they stood still as carved
stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir trumpets blared and the walls
of isengard echoed we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was
going to begin but nothing of the sort all sarumans people were marching
away i dont know much about this war or about the horsemen of rohan but
saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one
final blow he emptied isengard i saw the enemy go: endless lines of marching
orcs and troops of them mounted on great wolves and there were battalions of
men too many of them carried torches and in the flare i could see their
faces most of them were ordinary men rather tall and dark-haired and grim but
not particularly evil-looking but there were some others that were horrible:
man-high but with goblin-faces sallow leering squint-eyed do you know they
reminded me at once of that southerner at bree: only he was not so obviously
orc-like as most of these were
i thought of him too said aragorn we had many of these half-orcs to deal
with at helms deep it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy of
sarumans but whether he was working with the black riders or for saruman
alone i do not know it is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are
in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must have been ten thousand at the very
least said merry they took an hour to pass out of the gates some went off
down the highway to the fords and some turned away µ and went eastward a
bridge has been built down there about a mile away where the river runs in a
very deep channel you could see it now if you stood up they were all singing
with harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din i thought things looked
very black for rohan but treebeard did not move he said: my business is with
isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could not see what was happening in the dark i believe that
huorns began to move south as soon as the gates were shut again their business
was with orcs i think they were far down the valley in the morning or any rate
there was a shadow there that one couldnt see through
as soon as saruman had sent off all his army our turn came treebeard put
us down and went up to the gates and began hammering on the doors and calling
for saruman there was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls but
arrows are no use against ents they hurt them of course and infuriate them:
like stinging flies but an ent can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a
pin-cushion and take no serious harm they cannot be poisoned for one thing
and their skin seems to be very thick and tougher than bark it takes a very
heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously they dont like axes but there would
have to be a great many axe-men to one ent: a man that hacks once at an ent
never gets a chance of a second blow a punch from an ent-fist crumples up iron
like thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he began to warm up to get
positively "hasty" as he would say he let out a great hoom-hom
and a dozen more ents came striding up an angry ent is terrifying their
fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock and they tear it up like
bread-crust it was like watching the work of great tree-roots in a hundred
years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang-bang crash-crack
in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin and some were
already beginning to eat into the walls like rabbits in a sand-pit i dont
know what saruman thought was happening but anyway he did not know how to deal
with it his wizardry may have been falling off lately of course but anyway i
think he has not much grit not much plain courage alone in a tight place
without a lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what i mean very
different from old gandalf i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly due to
his cleverness in settling at isengard
no said aragorn once he was as great as his fame made him his knowledge
was deep his thought was subtle and his hands marvellously skilled and he had
a power over the minds of others the wise he could persuade and the smaller
folk he could daunt that power he certainly still keeps there are not many in
middle-earth that i should say were safe if they were left alone to talk with
him even now when he has suffered a defeat gandalf elrond and galadriel
perhaps now that his wickedness has been laid bare but very few others
the ents are safe said pippin he seems at one time to have got round
them but never again and anyway he did not understand them and he made the
great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations he had no plan for them
and there was no time to make any once they had set to work as soon as our
attack began the few remaining rats in isengard started bolting through every
hole that the ents made the ents let the men go after they had questioned
them two or three dozen only down at this end i dont think many orc-folk of
any size escaped not from the huorns: there was a wood full of them all round
isengard by that time as well as those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to rubbish and
what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a
panic he seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: i expect he came to
watch his splendid army march out when the ents broke their way in he left in
a hurry they did not spot him at first but the night had opened out and there
was a great light of stars quite enough for ents to see by and suddenly
quickbeam gave a cry "the tree-killer the tree-killer" quickbeam is
a gentle creature but he hates saruman all the more fiercely for that: his
people suffered cruelly from orc-axes he leapt down the path from the inner
gate and he can move like a wind when he is roused there was a pale figure
hurrying away in and out of the shadows of the pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower-door but it was a near thing quickbeam was so
hot after him that he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled
when he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in orthanc it was not long before he set some of
his precious machinery to work by that time there were many ents inside
isengard: some had followed quickbeam and others had burst in from the north
and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage suddenly up
came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to
spout and belch several of the ents got scorched and blistered one of them
beechbone i think he was called a very tall handsome ent got caught in a spray
of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a horrible sight
that sent them mad i thought that they had been really roused before but i
was wrong i saw what it was like at last it was staggering they roared and
boomed and trumpeted until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of
them merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears round
and round the rock of orthanc the ents went striding and storming like a howling
gale breaking pillars hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts tossing
up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves the tower was in the middle of
a spinning whirlwind i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up
hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc but treebeard kept
his head he had not had any burns luckily he did not want his folk to hurt
themselves in their fury and he did not want saruman to escape out of some hole
in the confusion many of the ents were hurling themselves against the
orthanc-rock but that defeated them it is very smooth and hard some wizardry
is in it perhaps older and stronger than sarumans anyway they could not get
a grip on it or make a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding
themselves against it so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted his
enormous voice rose above all the din there was a dead silence suddenly in it
we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower that had a queer effect
on the ents they had been boiling over now they became cold grim as ice and
quiet they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own language i think he was telling them
of a plan he had made in his old head long before then they just faded silently
away in the grey light day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but the watchers were so well
hidden in shadows and kept so still that i could not see them the others went
away north all that day they were busy out of sight most of the time we were
left alone it was a dreary day and we wandered about a bit though we kept out
of the view of the windows of orthanc as much as we could: they stared at us so
threateningly a good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening away south in rohan
and what had become of all the rest of our company every now and then we could
hear in the distance the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises echoing
in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round the circle and went to have a look at what
was going on there was a great shadowy wood of huorns at the head of the
valley and another round the northern wall we did not dare to go in but there
was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside ents and huorns were
digging great pits and trenches and making great pools and dams gathering all
the waters of the isen and every other spring and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came back to the gate he was humming and booming to
himself and seemed pleased he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and
breathed deep i asked him if he was tired
 "tired" he said "tired well no not tired but stiff i
need a good draught of entwash we have worked hard we have done more
stone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long year
before but it is nearly finished when night falls do not linger near this gate
or in the old tunnel water may come through-and it will be foul water for a
while until all the filth of saruman is washed away then isen can run clean
again" he began to pull down a bit more of the walls in a leisurely sort
of way just to amuse himself
we were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep
when the most amazing thing of all happened there was the sound of a rider
coming swiftly up the road merry and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadows under the arch suddenly a great horse came striding up like a
flash of silver it was already dark but i could see the riders face clearly:
it seemed to shine and all his clothes were white i just sat up staring with
my mouth open i tried to call out and couldnt
there was no need he halted just by us and looked down at us gandalf i
said at last but my voice was only a whisper did he say: "hullo pippin
this is a pleasant surprise" no indeed he said: "get up you
tom-fool of a took where in the name of wonder in all this ruin is treebeard
i want him quick"
treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once and there was
a strange meeting i was surprised because neither of them seemed surprised at
all gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him yet we
had told the old ent all about moria but then i remembered a queer look he gave
us at the time i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or had some news of
him but would not say anything in a hurry "dont be hasty" is his
motto but nobody not even elves will say much about gandalfs movements when
he is not there
"hoom gandalf" said treebeard "i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and stone i can master but there is a wizard to manage
here"
"treebeard" said gandalf "i need your help you have done
much but i need more i have about ten thousand orcs to manage"
then those two went off and had a council together in some corner it must
have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandalf was in a tremendous hurry and
was already talking at a great pace before they passed out of hearing they
were only away a matter of minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour then gandalf
came back to us and he seemed relieved almost merry he did say he was glad to
see us then
"but gandalf" i cried "where have you been and have you
seen the others"
"wherever i have been i am back" he answered in the genuine
gandalf manner "yes i have seen some of the others but news must wait
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast but the dawn may be brighter
and if so we shall meet again take care of yourselves and keep away from
orthanc good-bye"
treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone he had evidently
learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it he looked at us and said:
"hm well i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought you said much
less than you might and not more than you should hm this is a bundle of news
and no mistake well now treebeard must get busy again"
before he went we got a little news out of him and it did not cheer us up
at all but for the moment we thought more about you three than about frodo and
sam or about poor boromir for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on or soon would be and that you were in it and might never come out of it
"huorns will help" said treebeard then he went away and we did
not see him again until this morning
it was deep night we lay on top of a pile of stone and could see nothing
beyond it mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round
us the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full of rustlings creakings and a
murmur like voices passing i think that hundreds more of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle later there was a great rumble of thunder
away south and flashes of lightning far away across rohan every now and then
we could see mountain-peaks miles and miles away stab out suddenly black and
white and then vanish and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills
but different at times the whole valley echoed
it must have been about midnight when the ents broke the dams and poured all
the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall down into isengard the
huorn-dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away the moon was sinking
behind the western mountains
isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools they
glittered in the last light of the moon as they spread over the plain every
now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or spouthole great
white steams hissed up smoke rose in billows there were explosions and gusts
of fire one great coil of vapour went whirling up twisting round and round
orthanc until it looked like a tall peak of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit
above and still more water poured in until at last isengard looked like a huge
flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to
the mouth of nan curunír said aragorn we feared that saruman was
brewing some new devilry for us
not he said pippin he was probably choking and not laughing any more by
the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down into all the holes and
there was a dense fog we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we had
rather a fright the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel
and the water was rapidly rising up the steps we thought we were going to get
caught like orcs in a hole but we found a winding stair at the back of the
store-room that brought us out on top of the arch it was a squeeze to get out
as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the
top there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all the fires were quenched and
every cave filled the fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge
umbrella of cloud: it must have been a mile high in the evening there was a
great rainbow over the eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by a
thick drizzle on the mountain-sides it all went very quiet a few wolves howled
mournfully far away the ents stopped the inflow in the night and sent the
isen back into its old course and that was the end of it all
since then the water has been sinking again there must be outlets somewhere
from the caves underneath i think if saruman peeps out of any of his windows
it must look an untidy dreary mess we felt very lonely not even a visible ent
to talk to in all the ruin and no news we spent the night up on top there
above the arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep we had a feeling
that anything might happen at any minute saruman is still in his tower there
was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley i think the ents and
huorns that had been away came back then but where they have all gone to now i
dont know it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round
again and nobody was about and that is about all there is to tell it seems
almost peaceful now after all the turmoil and safer too somehow since gandalf
came back i could sleep
they all fell silent for a while gimli re-filled his pipe there is one
thing i wonder about he said as he lit it with
his flint and tinder: wormtongue you told théoden he was with saruman
how did he get there
oh yes i forgot about him said pippin he did not get here till this
morning we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared
again we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
"i have just come round to see how you are faring my lads he said
and to give you some news huorns have come back alls well aye very well
indeed" he laughed and slapped his thighs "no more orcs in
isengard no more axes and there will be folk coming up from the south before
the day is old some that you may be glad to see"
he had hardly said that when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road we
rushed out before the gates and i stood and stared half expecting to see
strider and gandalf come riding up at the head of an army but out of the mist
there rode a man on an old tired horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of
creature himself there was no one else when he came out of the mist and
suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he sat and gaped and
his face went almost green he was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice
us at first when he did he gave a cry and tried to turn his horse round and
ride off but treebeard took three strides put out
a long arm and lifted him out of the saddle his horse bolted in terror and he
grovelled on the ground he said he was gríma friend and counsellor of
the king and had been sent with important messages from théoden
to saruman
"no one else would dare to ride through the open land so full of foul
orcs" he said "so i was sent and i have had a perilous journey and
i am hungry and weary i fled far north out of my way pursued by wolves"
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard and i said to myself
"liar" treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several
minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor then at last he said:
"ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue" the man started at
that name "gandalf got here first so i know as much about you as i need
and i know what to do with you put all the rats in one trap said gandalf and
i will i am the master of isengard now but saruman is locked in his tower and
you can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of"
"let me go let me go" said wormtongue "i know the
way"
"you knew the way i dont doubt" said treebeard "but
things have changed here a little go and see"
he let wormtongue go and he limped off through the arch with us close
behind until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay
between him and orthanc then he turned to us
"let me go away" he whined "let me go away my messages are
useless now"
"they are indeed" said treebeard "but you have only two
choices: to stay with me until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the
water which will you have"
the man shivered at the mention of his master and put a foot into the
water but he drew back "i cannot swim" he said
"the water is not deep" said treebeard "it is dirty but
that will not harm you master wormtongue in you go now"
with that the wretch floundered off into the flood it rose up nearly to his
neck before he got too far away for me to see him the last i saw of him was
clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood but treebeard waded after him and
watched his progress
"well he has gone in" he said when he returned "i saw him
crawling up the steps like a draggled rat there is someone in the tower still:
a hand came out and pulled him in so there he is and i hope the welcome is to
his liking now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime ill be away up on
the north side if anyone wants to see me there is no clean water down here fit
for an ent to drink or to bathe in so i will ask you two lads to keep a watch
at the gate for the folk that are coming therell be the lord of the fields of
rohan mark you you must welcome him as well as you know how: his men have
fought a great fight with the orcs maybe you know the right fashion of mens
words for such a lord better than ents there have been many lords in the green
fields in my time and i have never learned their speech or their names they
will be wanting man-food and you know all about that i guess so find what you
think is fit for a king to eat if you can" and that is the end of the
story though i should like to know who this wormtongue is was he really the
kings counsellor
he was said aragorn and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan fate
has not been kinder to him than he deserves the sight of the ruin of all that
he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kindness said
merry he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to
himself when he went to get his bathe and drink we spent a busy time after
that searching the flotsam and rummaging about we found two or three
store-rooms in different places nearby above the flood-level but treebeard
sent some ents down and they carried off a great deal of the stuff
"we want man-food for twenty-five" the ents said so you can see
that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived you three
were evidently meant to go with the great people but you would not have fared
any better we kept as good as we sent i promise you better because we sent
no drink
"what about drink" i said to the ents
"there is water of isen" they said "and that is good enough
for ents and men" but i hope that the ents may have found time to brew
some of their draughts from the mountain-springs and we shall see gandalfs
beard curling when he returns after the ents had gone we felt tired and
hungry but we did not grumble - our labours had been well rewarded it was
through our search for man-food that pippin discovered the prize of all the
flotsam those hornblower barrels "pipe-weed is better after food"
said pippin that is how the situation arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn: leaf from the southfarthing in
isengard the more i consider it the more curious i find it i have never been
in isengard but i have journeyed in this land and i know well the empty
countries that lie between rohan and the shire neither goods nor folk have
passed that way for many a long year not openly saruman had secret dealings
with someone in the shire i guess wormtongues may
be found in other houses than king théodens was there a date on the
barrels
yes said pippin it was the 1417 crop that is last years no the year
before of course now: a good year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now i hope or else it is beyond
our reach at present said aragorn yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf
small matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what he is doing said merry the afternoon is getting on let us
go and look round you can enter isengard now at any rate strider if you want
to but it is not a very cheerful sight
 
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones gazing
at the dark rock of orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolation that lay all about it the waters had now nearly all subsided here
and there gloomy pools remained covered with scum and wreckage but most of the
wide circle was bare again a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock pitted with
blackened holes and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way
and that at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes
like the shingles cast up by a great storm and beyond them the green and
tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the
mountains across the waste they saw riders picking their way they were coming
from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and théoden and his men said legolas let
us go and meet them
walk warily said merry there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take care
they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orthanc going
slowly for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed the riders seeing them
approach halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them gandalf rode
forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and made a few
plans he said and we have all had some much-needed rest now we must be
going on again i hope you companions have all rested too and refreshed
yourselves
we have said merry but our discussions began and ended in smoke still
we feel less ill-disposed towards saruman than we did
do you indeed said gandalf well i do not i have now a last task to do
before i go: i must pay saruman a farewell visit dangerous and probably
useless but it must be done those of you who wish may come with me - but
beware and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will come said gimli i wish to see him and learn if he really looks
like you
and how will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf saruman could
look like me in your eyes if it suited his purpose with you and are you yet
wise enough to detect all his counterfeits well we shall see perhaps he may
be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together but i have
ordered all the ents to remove themselves from sight so perhaps we shall
persuade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin will he shoot at us and pour fire out of
the windows or can he put a spell on us from a distance
the last is most likely if you ride to his door with a light heart said
gandalf but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try a wild
beast cornered is not safe to approach and saruman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice
they came now to the foot of orthanc it was black and the rock gleamed as
if it were wet the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as though they had
been newly chiselled a few scorings and small flake-like splinters near the
base were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers there was a great door high
above the ground and over it was a shuttered window opening upon a balcony
hedged with iron bars up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of
twenty-seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but many tall windows were cut with
deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in
the sheer faces of the horns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted i will go up
said gandalf i have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i too will go up said the king i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong éomer shall
come with me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf aragorn shall come with me let the others
await us at the foot of the stairs they will hear and see enough if there is
anything to hear or see
nay said gimli legolas and i wish for a closer view we alone here
represent our kindred we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed the steps and théoden
went beside him
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on either side of the
stair and looked up darkly at the great tower fearing what might befall their
lord merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and
unsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin i wish i could
slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed what did we come for we are not
wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat on it with his staff it
rang with a hollow sound saruman saruman he cried in a loud commanding
voice saruman come forth
for some time there was no answer at last the window above the door was
unbarred hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice what do you wish
théoden started i know that voice he said and i curse the day
when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become his footman gríma
wormtongue said gandalf and do not waste our time
the window closed they waited suddenly another voice spoke low and
melodious its very sound an enchantment those who listened unwarily to that
voice could seldom report the words that they heard and if they did they
wondered for little power remained in them mostly they remembered only that it
was a delight to hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise and
reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast and if they
gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in the hearts of those under the spell
fur some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them and when it spake
to another they smiled as men do who see through a jugglers trick while others
gape at it for many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them
enthralled but for those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far
away and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them but none
were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind
and will so long as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle question why must you disturb my rest will
you give me no peace at all by night or day its tone was that of a kindly
heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound of his coming and
they saw a figure standing at the rail looking down upon them: an old man
swathed in a great cloak the colour of which was not easy to tell for it
changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred his face was long with a
high forehead he had deep darkling eyes hard to fathom though the look that
they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weary his hair and beard
were white but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the soft voice two at
least of you i know by name gandalf i know too well to have much hope that he
seeks help or counsel here but you théoden lord of the mark of rohan
are declared by your noble devices and still more by the fair countenance of
the house of eorl o worthy son of thengel the thrice-renowned why have you not
come before and as a friend much have i desired to see you mightiest king of
western lands and especially in these latter years to save you from the unwise
and evil counsels that beset you is it yet too late despite the injuries that
have been done to me in which the men of rohan alas have had some part still
i would save you and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if
you ride upon this road which you have taken indeed i alone can aid you now
théoden opened his mouth as if to speak but he said nothing he
looked up at the face of saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him
and then to gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate gandalf made
no sign but stood silent as stone as one waiting patiently for some call that
has not yet come the riders stirred at first murmuring with approval of the
words of saruman and then they too were silent as men spell-bound it seemed
to them that gandalf had never spoken so fair and
fittingly to their lord rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with théoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of a great danger: the end of the
mark in a darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stood
beside a door of escape holding it half open so that a ray of light came
through there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly the words of this wizard stand
on their heads he growled gripping the handle of his axe in the language of
orthanc help means ruin and saving means slaying that is plain but we do not
come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his voice was less suave
and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone i
do not speak to you yet gimli glóins son he said far away is your
home and small concern of yours are the troubles of this land but it was not by
design of your own that you became embroiled in them and so i will not blame
such part as you have played-a valiant one i doubt not but i pray you
allow me first to speak with the king of rohan my neighbour and once my
friend
what have you to say théoden king will you have peace with me and
all the aid that my knowledge founded in long years can bring shall we
make our counsels together against evil days and repair our injuries with such
good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever before
still théoden did not answer whether he strove with anger or doubt
none could say éomer spoke
lord hear me he said now we feel the peril that we were warned of have
we ridden forth to victory only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with
honey on his forked tongue so would the trapped wolf speak to the hounds if
he could what aid can he give to you forsooth all he desires is to escape
from his plight but will you parley with this dealer in treachery and murder
remember théodred at the fords and the grave of háma in helms
deep
if we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we
say of yours young serpent said saruman and the flash of his anger was now
plain to see but come éomer éomunds son he went on in his
soft voice again to every man h part valour in arms is yours and you win high
honour thereby slay whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand but maybe if you become a
king you will find that he must choose his friends with care the friendship of
saruman and the power of orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside whatever
grievances real or fancied may lie behind you have won a battle but not a war
and that with help on which you cannot count again you may find the shadow of
the wood at your own door next: it is wayward and senseless and has no love
for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called a murderer because valiant men have
fallen in battle if you go to war needlessly for i did not desire it then
men will be slain but if i am a murderer on that account then all the house
of eorl is stained with murder for they have fought many wars and assailed
many who defied them yet with some they have afterwards made peace none the
worse for being politic i say théoden king: shall we have peace and
friendship you and i it is ours to command 
we will have peace said théoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly théoden held up his hand yes
we will have peace he said now in a clear voice we will have peace when
you and all your works have perished - and the works of your dark master
to whom you would deliver us you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens
hearts you hold out your hand to me and i perceive only a finger of the claw
of mordor cruel and cold even if your war on me was just as it was not for
were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your
own profit as you desired - even so what will you say of your torches in
westfold and the children that lie dead there and they hewed hámas
body before the gates of the hornburg after he was dead when you hang from a
gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows i will have peace with
you and orthanc so much for the house of eorl a lesser son of great sires am
i but i do not need to lick your fingers turn elsewhither but i fear
your voice has lost its charm
the riders gazed up at théoden like men startled out of a dream harsh
as an old ravens their masters voice sounded in their ears after the music of
saruman but saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath he leaned
over the rail as if he would smite the king with his staff to some suddenly it
seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed and they shuddered at the hideous change
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in
the reek and their brats roll on the floor among the dogs too long have they
escaped the gibbet themselves but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight
and hard in the end hang if you will now his
voice changed as he slowly mastered himself i know not why i have had the
patience to speak to you for i need you not nor your little band of gallopers
as swift to fly as to advance théoden horsemaster long ago i
offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit i have offered it again so
that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads you give me
brag and abuse so be it go back to your huts
but you gandalf for you at least i am grieved feeling for your shame how
comes it that you can endure such company for you are proud gandalf-and not
without reason having a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far even
now will you not listen to my counsel
gandalf stirred and looked up what have you to say that you did not say at
our last meeting he asked or perhaps you have things to unsay
saruman paused unsay he mused as if puzzled unsay i endeavoured to
advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened you are proud and do
not love advice having indeed a store of your own wisdom but on that occasion
you erred i think misconstruing my intentions wilfully i fear that in my
eagerness to persuade you i lost patience and indeed i regret it for i bore
you no ill-will and even now i bear none though you return to me in the
company of the violent and the ignorant how should i are we not both members
of a high and ancient order most excellent in middle-earth our friendship
would profit us both alike much we could still accomplish together to heal the
disorders of the world let us understand one another and dismiss from thought
these lesser folk let them wait on our decisions for the common good i am
willing to redress the past and to receive you will you not consult with me
will you not come up
so great was the power that saruman exerted in this last effort that none
that stood within hearing were unmoved but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an erring but
much-loved minister but they were shut out listening at a door to words not
meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants overhearing the elusive
discourse of their elders and wondering how it would affect their lot of
loftier mould these two were made: reverend and wise it was inevitable that
they should make alliance gandalf would ascend into the tower to discuss deep
things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc the door
would be closed and they would be left outside
dismissed to await allotted work or punishment even in the mind of théoden
the thought took shape like a shadow of doubt: he will betray us he will go -
we shall be lost
then gandalf laughed the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said gandalf still laughing saruman you missed your
path in life you should have been the kings jester and earned your bread and
stripes too by mimicking his counsellors ah me he paused getting the better
of his mirth understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i understand now too well i keep a clearer memory of your
arguments and deeds than you suppose when last i visited you you were the
jailor of mordor and there i was to be sent nay the guest who has escaped
from the roof will think twice before he comes back in by the door nay i do
not think i will come up but listen saruman for the last time will you not
come down isengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it so
may other things in which you still have trust would it not be well to leave it
for a while to turn to new things perhaps think well saruman will you not
come down
a shadow passed over sarumans face then it went deathly white before he
could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt
loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge for a second he hesitated
and no one breathed then he spoke and his voice was shrill and cold pride and
hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked does an unarmed man come down to speak with
robbers out of doors i can hear you well enough here i am no fool and i do
not trust you gandalf they do not stand openly on my stairs but i know where
the wild wood-demons are lurking at your command
the treacherous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily but you
need not fear for your skin i do not wish to kill you or hurt you as you
would know if you really understood me and i have the power to protect you i
am giving you a last chance you can leave orthanc free - if you choose
that sounds well sneered saruman very much in the manner of gandalf the
grey: so condescending and so very kind i do not doubt that you would find
orthanc commodious and my departure convenient but why should i wish to leave
and what do you mean by free there are conditions i presume
reasons for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others will occur to your thought your servants are destroyed and scattered
your neighbours you have made your enemies and you have cheated your new
master or tried to do so when his eye turns hither it will be the red eye of
wrath but when i say free i mean free: free from bond of chain or
command: to go where you will even even to mordor saruman if you desire but
you will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and your staff they shall be
pledges of your conduct to be returned later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage
and a red light was kindled in his eyes he laughed wildly later he cried
and his voice rose to a scream later yes when you also have the keys of
barad-dûr itself i suppose and the crowns of seven kings and the
rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes
larger than those that you wear now a modest plan hardly one in which my help
is needed i have other things to do do not be a fool if you wish to treat
with me while you have a chance go away and come back when you are sober and
leave behind these cut-throats and small rag-tag that dangle at your tail good
day he turned and left the balcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commanding voice to the amazement of
the others saruman turned again and as if dragged against his will he came
slowly back to the iron rail leaning on it breathing hard his face was lined
and shrunken his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly i have not finished
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiable you might still have turned
away from folly and evil and have been of service but you choose to stay and
gnaw the ends of your old plots stay then but i warn you you will not easily
come out again not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out to take you
saruman he cried and his voice grew in power and authority behold i am not
gandalf the grey whom you betrayed i am gandalf the white who has returned
from death you have no colour now and i cast you from the order and from the
council
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice saruman your
staff is broken there was a crack and the staff split asunder in sarumans
hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet go said gandalf with a
cry saruman fell back and crawled away at that moment a heavy shining thing
came hurtling down from above it glanced off the iron rail even as saruman
left it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the stair on which he
stood the rail rang and snapped the stair cracked and splintered in glittering
sparks but the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps a globe of
crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire as it bounded away towards a
pool pippin ran after it and picked it up
the murderous rogue cried éomer but gandalf was unmoved no that
was not thrown b saruman he said nor even at his bidding i think it came
from a window far above a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy
but ill aimed
the aim was poor maybe because he could not make up his mind which he
hated more you or saruman said aragorn
that may be so said gandalf small comfort will those two have in their
companionship: they will gnaw one another with words but the punishment is
just if wormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will be more than he
deserves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask you to handle it he cried
turning sharply and seeing pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he were
bearing a great weight he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe
from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak i will take care of
this he said it is not a thing i guess that saruman would have chosen to
cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli if that is the end of
the debate let us go out of stones throw at least
it is the end said gandalf let us go
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc and went down the riders
hailed the king with joy and saluted gandalf the spell of saruman was broken:
they had seen him come at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandalf now i must find treebeard and tell him
how things have gone
he will have guessed surely said merry were they likely to end any
other way
not likely answered gandalf though they came to the balance of a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so first saruman was
shown that the power of his voice was waning he cannot be both tyrant and
counsellor when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret yet he fell into
the trap and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal while others listened
then i gave him a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both mordor and his
private schemes and make amends by helping us in our need he knows our need
none better great service he could have rendered but he has chosen to withhold
it and keep the power of orthanc he will not serve only command he lives now
in terror of the shadow of mordor and yet he still dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he will be devoured if the power of the east stretches out its
arms to isengard we cannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron - who knows
what he can do
and what if sauron does not conquer what will you do to him asked pippin
i nothing said gandalf i will do nothing to him i do not wish for
mastery what w ill become of him i cannot say i grieve that so much that was
good now festers in the tower still for us things have not gone badly strange
are the turns of fortune often does hatred hurt itself i guess that even if
we had entered in we could have found few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddenly cut off came from an open window high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf let us leave them
they returned now to the ruins of the gate hardly had they passed out under
the arch when from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood
treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up aragorn gimli and legolas
gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf i have spoken of
them but you have not yet seen them he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas so you have come all the way from mirkwood my good
elf a very great forest it used to be
and still is said legolas but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood i
scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and i did not wish to turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure i hope you may have your wish ere
the hills be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas i have made a bargain
with my friend that if all goes well we will visit fangorn together - by your
leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome said treebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said legolas i mean gimli glóins
son here gimli bowed low and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on
the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard looking dark-eyed at him a dwarf and an
axe-bearer hoom i have good will to elves but you ask much this is a strange
friendship strange it may seem said legolas but while gimli lives i shall
not come to fangorn alone his axe is not for trees but for orc-necks o
fangorn master of fangorns wood forty-two he hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard that is a better story well well things
will go as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them but now we
must part for a while day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you must go
ere nightfall and the lord of the mark is eager for his own house
yes we must go and go now said gandalf i fear that i must take your
gatekeepers from you but you will manage well enough without them
maybe i shall said treebeard but i shall miss them we have become
friends in so short a while that i think i must be getting hasty - growing
backwards towards youth perhaps but there they are the first new thing under
sun or moon that i have seen for many a long long day i shall not forget them
i have put their names into the long list ents will remember it
ents the earthborn old as mountains

the wide-walkers water drinking

and hungry as hunters the hobbit children

the laughing-folk the little people
they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed fare you well but
if you hear news up in your pleasant land in the shire send me word you know
what i mean: word or sight of the entwives come yourselves if you can
we will said merry and pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his head
thoughtfully then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said i did not think he would his heart
is as rotten as a black huorns still if i were overcome and all my trees
destroyed i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
no said gandalf but you have not plotted to cover all the world with
your trees and choke all other living things but there it is saruman remains
to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can he has the key of
orthanc but he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebeard saruman shall not set
foot beyond the rock without my leave ents will watch over him
good said gandalf that is what i hoped now i can go and turn to other
matters with one care the less but you must be wary the waters have gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower i fear i do not doubt
that there were deep ways delved under orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and
come unmarked before long if you will undertake the labour i beg you to pour
in the waters again and do so until isengard remains a standing pool or you
discover the outlets when all the underground places are drowned and the
outlets blocked then saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the ents said treebeard we shall search the valley from head
to foot and peer under every pebble trees are coming back to live here old
trees wild trees the watchwood we will call it not a squirrel will go here
but i shall know of it leave it to ents until seven times the years in which
he tormented us have passed we shall not tire of watching him
chapter 11

the palantír
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when gandalf
and his companions and the king with his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn took pippin two of the kings men
went on ahead riding swiftly and passed soon out of sight down into the
valley the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate with their long arms
uplifted but they made no sound merry and pippin looked back when they had
passed some way down the winding road sunlight was still shining in the sky
but long shadows reached over isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump of an old tree: the
hobbits thought of their first meeting upon the sunny ledge far away on the
borders of fangorn
they came to the pillar of the white hand the pillar was still standing but
the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces right in the
middle of the road the long forefinger lay white in the dusk its red nail
darkening to black
the ents pay attention to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after a while i dont
know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you but the rag-tag is
tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf dont let it rankle be thankful no
longer words were aimed at you he had his eyes on you if it is any comfort to
your pride i should say that at the moment you and pippin are more in his
thoughts than all the rest of us who you are how you came there and why what
you know whether you were captured and if so how you escaped when all the
orcs perished - it is with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman
is troubled a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you feel honoured
by his concern
thank you said merry but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail
gandalf for one thing in that position one has a chance of putting a question
a second time are we riding far tonight
gandalf laughed a most unquenchable hobbit all wizards should have a
hobbit or two in their care - to teach them the meaning of the word and to
correct them i beg your pardon but i have given thought even to these simple
matters we will ride for a few hours gently until we come to the end of the
valley tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight from isengard back to the kings house
at edoras over the plains a ride of some days but we have taken thought and
changed the plan messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them that
the king is returning tomorrow he will ride from there with many men to
dunharrow by paths among the hills from now on no more than two or three
together are to go openly over the land by day or night when it can be
avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry i am afraid i was not
looking beyond tonights bed where and what are helms deep and all the rest of
it i dont know anything about this country
then youd best learn something if you wish to understand what is
happening but not just now and not from me: i have too many pressing things to
think about
all right ill tackle strider by the camp-fire: hes less testy but why
all this secrecy i thought wed won the battle
yes we have won but only the first victor and
that in itself increases our danger there was some link between isengard and
mordor which i have not yet fathomed how they exchanged news i am not sure
but they did so the eye of barad-dûr will be looking impatiently
towards the wizards vale i think and towards rohan the less it sees the
better
the road passed slowly winding down the valley now further and now nearer
isen flowed in its stony bed night came down from the mountains all the mists
were gone a chill wind blew the moon now waxing round filled the eastern sky
with a pale cold sheen the shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down
to bare hills the wide plains opened grey before them
at last they halted then they turned aside leaving the highway and taking
to the sweet upland turf again going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into the slope of round dol baran the last
hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather the sides of the
glen were shaggy with last years bracken among which the tight-curled fronds
of spring were just thrusting through the sweet-scented earth thornbushes grew
thick upon the low banks and under them they made their camp two hours or so
before the middle of the night they lit a fire in a hollow down among the
roots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a tree writhen with age but hale in
every limb buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch the rest after they had supped wrapped
themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept the hobbits lay in a corner by
themselves upon a pile of old bracken merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed
curiously restless the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matter asked merry are you lying on an ant-hill
no said pippin but im not comfortable i wonder how long it is since i
slept in a bed
merry yawned work it out on your fingers he said but you must know how
long it is since we left lórien
oh that said pippin i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then said merry but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck merry said pippin softly after a long pause you were
riding with gandalf
well what of it
did you get any news any information out of him
yes a good deal more than usual but you heard it all or most of it: you
were close by and we were talking no secrets but you can go with him tomorrow
if you think you can get more out of him-and if hell have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a little and beginning to wonder what
was bothering his companion he has grown or something he can be both kinder
and more alarming merrier and more solemn than before i think he has changed
but we have not had a chance to see how much yet but think of the last part of
that business with saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs superior: head
of the council whatever that may be exactly he was saruman the white gandalf
is the white now saruman came when he was told and his rod was taken and then
he was just told to go and he went
well if gandalf has changed at all then hes closer than ever thats all
pippin argued that-glass ball now he seemed mighty pleased with it he knows
or guesses something about it but does he tell us what no not a word yet i
picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool here ill take that
my lad - thats all i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy pippins
voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
hullo said merry so thats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildors saying - the one sam used to quote: do not meddle in
the at fairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of
wizards said pippin i should like a bit of information as well as danger i
should like a look at that ball
go to sleep said merry youll get information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for inquisitiveness but is this
the time i ask you
all right whats the harm in my telling you what i should like: a look at
that stone i know i cant have it with old gandalf sitting on it like a hen
on an egg but it doesnt help much to get no more from you than a you-cant-have-it
so-go-to-sleep
well what else could i say said merry im sorry pippin but you really
must wait till the morning ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard-wheedling but i cant keep awake any
longer if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears good night
pippin said no more he lay still now but sleep remained far away and it
was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing softly asleep in a few
minutes after saying good night the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow
stronger as all grew quiet pippin felt again its weight in his hands and saw
again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment he tossed
and turned and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer he got up and looked round it was
chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him the moon was shining cold and white
down into the dell and the shadows of the bushes were black all about lay
sleeping shapes the two guards were not in view: they were up on the hill
perhaps or hidden in the bracken driven by some impulse that he did not
understand pippin walked softly to where gandalf lay he looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed: there was a glitter of
eyes under his long lashes pippin stepped back hastily but gandalf made no
sign and drawn forward once more half against his will the hobbit crept up
again from behind the wizards head he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak
spread over the top and close beside him between his right side and his bent
arm there was a hummock something round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand
seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot by foot at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted the lump up: it did not
seem quite so heavy as he had expected only some bundle of oddments perhaps
after all he thought with a strange sense of relief but he did not put the
bundle down again he stood for a moment clasping it then an idea came into his
mind he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone in it and kneeling down
laid it back by the wizards hand then at last he looked at the thing that he
had uncovered there it was: a smooth globe of crystal now dark and dead lying
bare before his knees pippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back to his bed at that moment gandalf moved in his
sleep and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue his hand
groped out and clasped the wrapped stone then he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself youre going to get yourself
into frightful trouble put it back quick but he found now that his knees
quaked and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it back now without waking him he thought not till im a bit
calmer so i may as well have a look first not just here though he stole
away and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed the moon looked in
over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them he bent low
over it looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food in a corner
away from others he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it the air seemed still
and tense about him at first the globe was dark black as jet with the
moonlight gleaming on its surface then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that now he could not look away soon all
the inside seemed on fire the ball was spinning or the lights within were
revolving suddenly the lights went out he gave a gasp and struggled but he
remained bent clasping the ball with both hands closer and closer he bent and
then became rigid his lips moved soundlessly for a while then with a strangled
cry he fell back and lay still
the cry was piercing the guards leapt down from the banks all the camp was
soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf hastily he cast his cloak over the
globe where it lay but you pippin this is a grievous turn to things he
knelt by pippins body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid with unseeing
eyes staring up at the sky the devilry what mischief has he done-to himself
and to all of us the wizards face was drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening for his breath then
he laid his hands on his brow the hobbit shuddered his eyes closed he cried
out and sat up staring in bewilderment at all the faces round him pale in the
moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried in a shrill and toneless voice
shrinking away from gandalf i will send for it at once do you understand say
just that then he struggled to get up and escape but gandalf held him gently
and firmly
peregrin took he said come back
the hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand gandalf
he cried gandalf forgive me
forgive you said the wizard tell me first what you have done
i i took the ball and looked at it stammered pippin and i saw things
that frightened me and i wanted to go away but i couldnt and then he came
and questioned me and he looked at me and and that is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly what did you see and what did you
say
pippin shut his eyes and shivered but said nothing they all stared at him
in silence except merry who turned away but gandalfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly his words grew
clearer and stronger i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said and
tiny stars it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear then the
stars went in and out-they were cut off by things with wings very big i think
really but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower i
thought there were nine of them one began to fly straight towards me getting
bigger and bigger it had a horrible - no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it would fly out but when it had
covered all the globe it disappeared then he came he did not speak so
that i could hear words he just looked and i understood
"so you have come back why have you neglected to report for so
long"
i did not answer he said: "who are you" i still did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i said: "a hobbit"
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me it was cruel it
was like being stabbed with knives i struggled but he said: "wait a
moment we shall meet again soon tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once do you understand say just that"
then he gloated over me i felt i was falling to pieces no no i cant say
any more i dont remember anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into his eyes the wizard held his gaze for a
moment in silence then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smile
appeared he laid his hand softly on pippins head
all right he said say no more you have taken no harm there is no lie
in your eyes as i feared but he did not speak long with you a fool but an
honest fool you remain peregrin took wiser ones might have done worse in such
a pass but mark this you have been saved and all your friends too mainly by
good fortune as it is called you cannot count on it a second time if he had
questioned you then and there almost certainly you would have told all that
you know to the ruin of us all but he was too eager he did not want
information only: he wanted you quickly so that he could deal with you in the
dark tower slowly dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs of wizards
you must be prepared to think of such things but come i forgive you be
comforted things have not turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed merry followed and
sat down beside him lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
trust me if you feel an itch in your palms again tell me of it such things
can be cured but anyway my dear hobbit dont put a lump of rock under my
elbow again now i will leave you two together for a while
with that gandalf returned to the others who were still standing by the
orthanc-stone in troubled thought peril comes in the night when least
expected he said we have had a narrow escape
how is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf he was not held long and
hobbits have an amazing power of recovery the memory or the horror of it will
probably fade quickly too quickly perhaps will you aragorn take the
orthanc-stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to all said aragorn there is one who may claim
it by right for this assuredly is the palantír
of orthanc from the treasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor now my
hour draws near i will take it
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise of the others he lifted
the covered stone and bowed as he presented it
receive it lord he said: in earnest of other things that shall be given
back but if i may counsel you in the use of your own do not use it - yet be
wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited and prepared for so many
long years said aragorn
never yet do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secret you and all others that stand here
the hobbit peregrin above all should not know where it is bestowed the evil
fit may come on him again for alas he has handled it and looked in it as
should never have happened he ought never to have touched it in isengard and
there i should have been quicker but my mind was bent on saruman and i did not
at once guess the nature of the stone then i was weary and as i lay pondering
it sleep overcame me now i know
yes there can be no doubt said aragorn at last we know the link
between isengard and mordor and how it worked
much is explained strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses
said théoden but it has long been said: oft evil will shall
evil mar
that many times is seen said gandalf but at this time we have been
strangely fortunate maybe i have been saved by this hobbit from a grave
blunder i had considered whether or not to probe this stone myself to find its
uses had i done so i should have been revealed to him myself i am not ready
for such a trial if indeed i shall ever be so: but even if i found the power to
withdraw myself it would be disastrous for him to see me yet - until the hour
comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf there remains a short while of doubt which we must
use the enemy it is clear thought that the stone was in orthanc - why should
he not and that therefore the hobbit was captive there driven to look in the
glass for his torment by saruman that dark mind will be filled now with the
voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before
he learns his error we must snatch that time we have been too leisurely we
must move the neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in i will
ride ahead at once with peregrin took it will be better for him than lying in
the dark while others sleep
i will keep éomer and ten riders said the king they shall ride
with me at early day the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon as they have
a mind
as you will said gandalf but make all the speed you may to the cover of
the hills to helms deep
at that moment a shadow fell over them the bright moonlight seemed to be
suddenly cut off several of the riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms above their heads as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind fear and a
deadly cold fell on them cowering they looked up a vast winged shape passed
over the moon like a black cloud it wheeled and went north flying at a speed
greater than any wind of middle-earth the stars fainted before it it was gone
they stood up rigid as stones gandalf was gazing up his arms out and
downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgûl he cried the messenger of mordor the storm is coming the
nazgûl have crossed the river ride ride wait not for the dawn
let not the swift wait for the slow ride
he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran aragorn followed him going to
pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms you shall come with me this time
he said shadowfax shall show you his paces then he ran to the place where he
had slept shadowfax stood there already slinging the small bag which was all
his luggage across his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cloak and
blanket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf away shadowfax
the great horse tossed his head his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone like the north wind from
the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to aragorn some folk have
wonderful luck he did not want to sleep and he wanted to ride with gandalf -
and there he goes instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here
for ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the orthanc-stone and not he how would
it be now said aragorn you might have done worse who can say but now it is
your luck to come with me i fear at once go and get ready and bring anything
that pippin left behind make haste
over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance less
than an hour had passed and they had reached the fords of isen and crossed
them the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
pippin was recovering he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and
refreshing he was with gandalf the horror of the stone and of the hideous
shadow over the moon was fading things left behind in the mists of the
mountains or in a passing dream he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode bare-back gandalf he said you havent a saddle
or a bridle
i do not ride elf-fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf but
shadowfax will have no harness you do not ride shadowfax: he is willing to
carry you-or not if he is willing that is enough it is then his business to
see that you remain on his back unless you jump off into the air
how fast is he going asked pippin fast by the wind but very smooth and
how light his footfalls are
he is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop answered
gandalf but that is not fast for him the land is rising a little here and is
more broken than it was beyond the river but see how the white mountains are
drawing near under the stars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the
deeping-coomb where the battle was fought two nights ago
pippin was silent again for a while he heard gandalf singing softly to
himself murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran
under them at last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the
words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the wind:
tall ships and tall kings

three times three

what brought they from the foundered land

over the flowing sea

seven stars and seven stones

and one white tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes of lore in my mind  answered the
wizard hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even those that they ever
knew
no not all said pippin and we have many of our own which wouldnt
interest you perhaps but i have never heard this one what is it about - the
seven stars and seven stones
about the palantíri of the
kings of old said gandalf
and what are they
the name meant that which looks far away the orthanc-stone was one
then it was not made not made - pippin hesitated - by the enemy
no said gandalf nor by saruman it is beyond his art and beyond
saurons too the palantíri
came from beyond westernesse from eldamar the noldor made them fëanor
himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago that the time cannot be
measured in years but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil
uses alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceive perilous to us
all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves yet he must bear
the blame fool to keep it secret for his own profit no word did he ever
speak of it to any of the council we had not yet given thought to the fate of
the palantíri of gondor in its
ruinous wars by men they were almost forgotten even in gondor they were a
secret known only to a few in arnor they were
remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the dúnedain
what did the men of old use them for asked pippin delighted and
astonished at getting answers to so many questions and wondering how long it
would last
to see far off and to converse in thought with one another said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor they set up
stones at minas anor and at minas ithil and at orthanc in the ring of
isengard the chief and master of these was under the
dome of stars at osgiliath before its ruin the three others were far away in
the north in the house of elrond it is told that they were at annúminas
and amon sûl and elendils stone was on the tower hills that look towards
mithlond in the gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantír replied to
each but all those in gondor were ever open to the view of osgiliath now it
appears that as the rock of orthanc has withstood the storms of time so there
the palantír of that tower has
remained but alone it could do nothing but see
small images of things far off and days remote very useful no doubt that was
to saruman yet it seems that he was not content further and further abroad he
gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad-dûr then he was caught
who knows where the lost stones of arnor and gondor now lie buried or
drowned deep but one at least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his
purposes i guess that it was the ithil-stone for he took minas ithil long ago
and turned it into an evil place: minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of saruman was trapped
and held and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when
persuasion would not serve the biter bit the hawk under the
eagles foot the spider in a steel web how long i wonder has he been
constrained to come often to his glass for inspection and instruction and the
orthanc-stone so bent towards barad-dûr that if any save a will of
adamant now looks into it it will bear his mind and sight swiftly
thither and how it draws one to itself have i not felt it even now my heart
desires to test my will upon it to see if i could not wrench it from him and
turn it where i would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time
to tirion the fair and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of fëanor
at their work while both the white tree and the golden were in flower he
sighed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin i had no notion of what i
was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf you knew you were behaving wrongly and
foolishly and you told yourself so though you did not listen i did not tell
you all this before because it is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last understood even as we ride together but if i had spoken sooner
it would not have lessened your desire or made it easier to resist on the
contrary no the burned hand teaches best after that advice about fire goes to
the heart
it does said pippin if all the seven stones were laid out before me now
i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
good said gandalf that is what i hoped
but i should like to know- pippin began
mercy cried gandalf if the giving of information is to be the cure of
your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you
what more do you want to know
the names of all the stars and of all living things and the whole history
of middle-earth and over-heaven and of the sundering seas  laughed pippin of
course what less but i am not in a hurry tonight at the moment i was just
wondering about the black shadow i heard you shout "messenger of
mordor" what was it what could it do at isengard
it was a black rider on wings a nazgûl
said gandalf it could have taken you away to the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin i mean it didnt
know that i had… 
of course not said gandalf it is two hundred leagues or more in straight
flight from barad-dûr to orthanc and even a
nazgûl would take a few hours to fly between them but saruman certainly
looked in the stone since the orc-raid and more of his secret thought i do not
doubt has been read than he intended a messenger has been sent to find
out what he is doing and after what has happened tonight another will come i
think and swiftly so saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he
has put his hand in he has no captive to send he has no stone to see with and
cannot answer the summons sauron will only believe that he is withholding the
captive and refusing to use the stone it will not help saruman to tell the
truth to the messenger for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in
orthanc so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel yet he rejected us
so as to avoid that very thing what he will do in such a plight i cannot
guess he has power still i think while in orthanc to resist the nine riders
he may try to do so he may try to trap the nazgûl
or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air in that case let
rohan look to its horses
but i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill for us it may be that
the counsels of the enemy will be confused or hindered by his wrath with
saruman it may be that he will learn that i was there and stood upon the stairs
of orthanc-with hobbits at my tail or that an heir of elendil lives and stood
beside me if wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan he would
remember aragorn and the title that he claimed that is what i fear and so we
fly - not from danger but into greater danger every stride of shadowfax bears
you nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as if a sudden chill had
struck him grey land passed under them
see now said gandalf the westfold dales are opening before us here we
come back to the eastward road the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the
deeping-coomb that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves do not ask me
about them ask gimli if you meet again and for the first time you may get an
answer longer than you wish you will not see the caves yourself not on this
journey soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms deep said pippin where are
you going then
to minas tirith before the seas of war surround it
oh and how far is that
leagues upon leagues answered gandalf thrice as far as the dwellings of
king théoden and they are more than a hundred miles east from
here as the messengers of mordor fly shadowfax must run a longer road which
will prove the swifter
we shall ride now till daybreak and that is some hours away then even
shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the hills: at edoras i hope sleep if
you can you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the house
of eorl and in two days thence you shall see the purple shadow of mount
mindolluin and the walls of the tower of denethor white in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never run before now
we are come to the lands where you were foaled and every stone you know run
now hope is in speed
shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud as if a trumpet had summoned him
to battle then he sprang forward fire flew from his feet night rushed over
him
as he fell slowly into sleep pippin had a strange feeling: he and gandalf
were still as stone seated upon the statue of a running horse while the world
rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind
 
 
 
well master were in a fix and no mistake said sam gamgee he stood
despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered out with puckered
eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they had fled from the company as far as they
could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the emyn muil
sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward
sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had
been hours before yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot
of hills but always they found its outward faces sheer high and impassable
frowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skirts lay livid festering
marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff bare and bleak its feet
wrapped in mist and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting
cloud a chill wind blew from the east night was gathering over the shapeless
lands before them the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown far
away to the right the anduin that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the
day was now hidden in shadow but their eyes did not look beyond the river
back to gondor to their friends to the lands of men south and east they
stared to where at the edge of the oncoming night a dark line hung like
distant mountains of motionless smoke every now and again a tiny red gleam far
away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky
what a fix  said sam thats the one place in all the lands weve ever
heard of that we dont want to see any closer and thats the one place were
trying to get to and thats just where we cant get nohow weve come the
wrong way altogether seemingly we cant get down and if we did get down wed
find all that green land a nasty bog ill warrant phew can you smell it he
sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did not move and his eyes remained
fixed staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame mordor  he
muttered under his breath if i must go there i wish i could come there quickly
and make an end  he shuddered the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour
of cold decay well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot stay
here all night fix or no fix we must find a more sheltered spot and camp once
more and perhaps another day will show us a path
or another and another and another muttered sam or maybe no day weve
come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo its my doom i think to go to that shadow yonder
so that a way will be found but will good or evil show it to me what hope we
had was in speed delay plays into the enemys hands-and here i am: delayed is
it the will of the dark tower that steers us all my choices have proved ill i
should have left the company long before and come down from the north east of
the river and of the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle plain to the
passes of mordor but now it isnt possible for you and me alone to find a way
back and the orcs are prowling on the east bank every day that passes is a
precious day lost i am tired sam i dont know what is to be done what food
have we got left
only those what dyou call em lembas mr frodo a fair supply
but they are better than naught by a long bite i never thought though when i
first set tooth in them that i should ever come to wish for a change but i do
now: a bit of plain bread and a mug - aye half a mug - of beer would go down
proper ive lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp and what use
has it been naught to make a fire with for a start and naught to cook not
even grass
they turned away and went down into a stony hollow the westering sun was
caught into clouds and night came swiftly they slept as well as they could for
the cold turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged pinnacles of
weathered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frodo asked sam as they sat stiff and
chilled munching wafers of lembas in the cold grey of early morning
no said frodo ive heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam grrr those eyes did give me a turn but perhaps weve
shaken him off at last the miserable slinker gollum ill give him gollum
in his throat if ever i get my hands on his neck
i hope youll never need to said frodo i dont know how he followed us
but it may be that hes lost us again as you say in this dry bleak land we
cant leave many footprints nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam i wish we could be rid of him for
good
so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble i wish we could get
away from these hills i hate them i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder theres
an eye in it come on weve got to get down today somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded towards evening they were
still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they heard
faint sounds behind them a stone falling or the imagined step of flapping feet
on the rock but if they halted and stood still listening they heard no more
nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the stones - yet even that
reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil had been bending gradually
northward as they struggled on along its brink there now stretched a wide
tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again by
trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff-face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming deeper and more frequent
frodo and sam were driven to their left well away from the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they had been going slowly but steadily
downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halt the ridge took a sharper bend northward
and was gashed by a deeper ravine on the further side it reared up again many
fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them cut sheer down
as if by a knife stroke they could go no further forwards and must turn now
either west or east but west would lead them only into more labour and delay
back towards the heart of the hills east would take them to the outer
precipice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to
a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed some way down they found a
few gnarled and stunted trees the first they had seen for days: twisted birch
for the most part with here and there a fir-tree many were dead and gaunt
bitten to the core by the eastern winds once in milder days there must have
been a fair thicket in the ravine but now after some fifty yards the trees
came to an end though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliffs
brink the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge of a rock-fault was
rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down when they came at last to the
end of it frodo stooped and leaned out
look he said we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has
sunk its much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge then he glanced up
at the great cliff rising up away on their left easier  he grunted well
i suppose its always easier getting down than up those as cant fly can jump
it would be a big jump still said frodo about well - he stood for a
moment measuring it with his eyes - about eighteen fathoms i should guess not
more
and thats enough  said sam ugh how i do hate looking down from a
height but lookings better than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could climb here and i think we
shall have to try see - the rock is quite different from what it was a few
miles back it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a little it
looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had shifted so that
its courses were all twisted and disordered leaving great fissures and long
slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we had better try at once its
getting dark early i think theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east was lost in a deeper blackness
that was already reaching out westwards with long arms there was a distant
mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze frodo sniffed the air and looked
up doubtfully at the sky he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened
it and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good  said sam gloomily but im going first
you  said frodo whats made you change your mind about climbing
i havent changed my mind but its only sense: put the one lowest as is
most likely to slip i dont want to come down atop of you and knock you off no
sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung his legs over the brink and
twisted round scrabbling with his toes for a foothold it is doubtful if he
ever did anything braver in cold blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass  said frodo youll kill yourself for certain
going over like that without even a look to see what to make for come back 
he took sam under the armpits and hauled him up again now wait a bit and be
patient  he said then he lay on the ground leaning out and looking down: but
the light seemed to be fading quickly although the sun had not yet set i
think we could manage this he said presently i could at any rate and you
could too if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam why you cant see to the
bottom in this light what if you comes to a place where theres nowhere to put
your feet or your hands
climb back i suppose said frodo
easy said objected sam better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo with a sudden strange vehemence i
grudge every hour every minute im going down to try it out dont you follow
till i come back or call
gripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself gently
down until when his arms were almost at full stretch his toes found a ledge
on_ e step down  he said and this ledge broadens out to the right i could
stand there without a hold ill- his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushed up from the east and
swallowed the sky there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills then came a blast of savage wind
and with it mingling with its roar there came a high shrill shriek the
hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the marish as they fled from
hobbiton and even there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their blood
out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold
blades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath sam fell flat on his
face involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and
ears he swayed slipped and slithered downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge master master  he
called master
he heard no answer he found he was shaking all over but he gathered his
breath and once again he shouted: master the wind seemed to blow his voice
back into his throat but as it passed roaring up the gully and away over the
hills a faint answering cry came to his ears:
all right all right im here but i cant see
frodo was calling with a weak voice he was not actually very far away he
had slid and not fallen and had come up with a jolt to his feet on a wider
ledge not many yards lower down fortunately the rock-face at this point leaned
well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff so that he had not
toppled over he steadied himself a little laying his face against the cold
stone feeling his heart pounding but either the darkness had grown complete
or else his eyes had lost their sight all was black about him he wondered if
he had been struck blind he took a deep breath
come back come back  he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant he said i cant see i cant find any hold i cant move yet
what can i do mr frodo what can i do  shouted sam leaning out
dangerously far why could not his master see it was dim certainly but not as
dark as all that he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed
against the cliff but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came in a blinding
sheet mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he hoped to help in that
way he could not have said
no no wait  frodo called back more strongly now i shall be better
soon i feel better already wait you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to
numbskulls youre nowt but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee: thats what the gaffer
said to me often enough it being a word of his rope
stop chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and
annoyed never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself youve got
some rope in your pocket if so out with it
yes mr frodo in my pack and all carried it hundreds of miles and id
clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down
quickly sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it there indeed at the bottom
was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of lórien he
cast an end to his master the darkness seemed to lift from frodos eyes or
else his sight was returning he could see the grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen now that he had some point in
the darkness to fix his eyes on he felt less giddy leaning his weight forward
he made the end fast round his waist and then he grasped the line with both
hands
sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from the
edge half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on the
ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falling
heavily the hobbits crawled away back into the gully but they did not find
much shelter there rills of water began to run down soon they grew to a spate
that splashed and fumed on the stones and spouted out over the cliff like the
gutters of a vast roof
i should have been half drowned down there or washed clean off said
frodo what a piece of luck you had that rope
better luck if id thought of it sooner said sam maybe you remember them
putting the ropes in the boats as we started off: in the elvish country i took
a fancy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack years ago it seems "it may
be a help in many needs" he said: haldir or one of those folk and he
spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length said frodo but i left
the company in such a hurry and confusion if only we had enough we could use it
to get down how long is your rope i wonder
sam paid it out slowly measuring it with his arms: five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would  said sam elves are wonderful folk it looks a bit thin
but its tough and soft as milk to the hand packs close too and as light as
light wonderful folk to be sure
thirty ells  said frodo considering i believe it would be enough if the
storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but dont you go doing
anything risky in the dim again mr frodo and i havent got over that shriek
on the wind yet if you have like a black rider it sounded-but one up in the
air if they can fly im thinking wed best lay up in this crack till nights
over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment longer than i need stuck up on
this edge with the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said
frodo
with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again he
looked out clear sky was growing in the east once more the skirts of the storm
were lifting ragged and wet and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought of sauron brooded for a
while thence it turned smiting the vale of anduin with hail and lightning and
casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war then lowering in the
mountains and gathering its great spires it rolled on slowly over gondor and
the skirts of rohan until far away the riders on the plain saw its black towers
moving behind the sun as they rode into the west but here over the desert and
the reeking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a few
pallid stars appeared like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent
moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep do you
know i thought for a bit that i had lost my sight from the lightning or
something else worse i could see nothing nothing at all until the grey rope
came down it seemed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam never noticed it
before though i cant remember as ive ever had it out since i first stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how are you going to use it thirty
ells or say about eighteen fathom: thats no more than your guess at the
height of the cliff
frodo thought for a while make it fast to that stump sam  he said then
i think you shall have your wish this time and go first ill lower you and you
need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give me a rest it will
help when youre down ill follow i feel quite myself again now
very well said sam heavily if it must be lets get it over  he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink then the other
end he tied about his own waist reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over
the edge a second time
it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected the rope seemed
to give him confidence though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked
down between his feet there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge and
the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space there he slipped and
swung out on the silver line but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it
was over at last his chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out
while he was still high up but there was still a good bight in frodos hands
when sam came to the bottom and called up: im down  his voice came up
clearly from below but frodo could not see him his grey elven-cloak had melted
into the twilight
frodo took rather more time to follow him he had the rope about his waist
and it was fast above and he had shortened it so that it would pull him up
before he reached the ground still he did not want to risk a fall and he had
not quite sams faith in this slender grey line he found two places all the
same where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces where there was no
hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart but at
last he too was down
well he cried weve done it weve escaped from the emyn muil and now
what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock under
foot again
but sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff ninnyhammers  he
said noodles my beautiful rope there it is tied to a stump and were at the
bottom just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve gone i thought it seemed a bit
too easy
if you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought
it down with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer or any other name your
gaffer gave you said frodo climb up and untie it and let yourself down if
you want to
sam scratched his head no i cant think how begging your pardon he
said but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact he stroked the ropes
end and shook it gently it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of
the elf-country made by galadriel herself too maybe galadriel he murmured
nodding his head mournfully he looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as
if in farewell
to the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose sam fell over
and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him frodo laughed
who tied the rope  he said a good thing it held as long as it did to think
that i trusted all my weight to your knot
sam did not laugh i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo he said
in injured tones but i do know something about rope and about knots its in
the family as you might say why my grand-dad and my uncle andy after him
him that was the gaffers eldest brother he had a rope-walk over by tighfield
many a year and i put as fast a hitch over the stump as any one could have
done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must have broken - frayed on the rock-edge i expect said
frodo
i bet it didnt  said sam in an even more injured voice he stooped and
examined the ends nor it hasnt neither not a strand
then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer he was passing the rope through his
fingers thoughtfully have it your own way mr frodo he said at last but i
think the rope came off itself - when i called he coiled it up and stowed it
lovingly in his pack
it certainly came said frodo and thats the chief thing but now weve
got to think of our next move night will be on us soon how beautiful the stars
are and the moon
they do cheer the heart dont they  said sam looking up elvish they
are somehow and the moons growing we havent seen him for a night or two in
this cloudy weather hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days i dont think well
try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of their
journey after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come the
mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff im glad weve got the
rope he said weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow he can try
his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff among a wilderness
of boulders and rough stones wet and slippery with the heavy rain the ground
still fell away sharply they had not gone very far when they came upon a great
fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet it was not wide but it
was too wide to jump across in the dim light they thought they could hear water
gurgling in its depths it curved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at any rate while darkness
lasted
we had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff i
think said sam we might find some nook there or even a cave or something
i suppose so said frodo im tired and i dont think i can scramble
among stones much longer tonight - though i grudge the delay i wish there was a
clear path in front of us: then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony slopes
frowned over by the cliff which now rose again higher and more sheer as they
went back in the end worn out they just cast themselves on the ground under
the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipice there for
some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony night while
sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off the moon now
rode high and clear its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and
drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff turning all the wide looming
darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows
well  said frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round
him you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket ill walk up and down on
sentry for a while suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the
arm whats that  he whispered look over there on the cliff
sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth ssss he said
thats what it is its that gollum snakes and adders and to think that i
thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of a climb look at him like a nasty
crawling spider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the pale
moonlight a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out maybe
its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds that no hobbit
could ever have seen or used but it looked as if it was just creeping down on
sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect-kind and it was coming
down head first as if it was smelling its way now and again it lifted its head
slowly turning it right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits caught a
glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights its eyes that blinked at the moon for
a moment and then were quickly lidded again
do you think he can see us  said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not it is hard even for
friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: i cannot see you in the shadow even at
a few paces and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here  asked sam
quietly sam  said frodo he can smell us perhaps and he can hear as
keen as elves i believe i think he has heard something now: our voices
probably we did a lot of shouting away back there and we were talking far too
loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam hes come once too often for me and im
going to have a word with him if i can i dont suppose we could give him the
slip now anyway drawing his grey hood well over his face sam crept stealthily
towards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind dont alarm him hes much more
dangerous than he looks
the black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down and perhaps
fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot crouching stone-still in the shadow
of a large boulder the hobbits watched him he seemed to have come to a
difficult passage or to be troubled about something they could hear him
snuffling and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like
a curse he lifted his head and they thought they heard him spit then he moved
on again now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautious my precious more haste less speed we musstnt rissk
our neck musst we precious no precious - gollum he lifted his head
again blinked at the moon and quickly shut his eyes we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is - sss - it spies on us precious - it hurts
our eyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer where
iss it where iss it: my precious my precious its ours it is and we wants
it the thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves where are they with my
precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were here does it  whispered sam and
whats his precious does he mean the
hsh  breathed frodo hes getting near now near enough to hear a
whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large head on its scrawny
neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening his pale eyes were
half unlidded sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitching his
eyes filled with anger and disgust were fixed on the wretched creature as he
now began to move again still whispering and hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground right above their
heads from that point there was a sheer drop for the cliff was slightly
undercut and even gollum could not find a hold of any kind he seemed to be
trying to twist round so as to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill
whistling shriek he fell as he did so he curled his legs and arms up round
him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and
the cliff foot in a couple of leaps before gollum could get up he was on top
of him but he found gollum more than he bargained for even taken like that
suddenly off his guard after a fall before sam could get a hold long legs and
arms were wound round him pinning his arms and a clinging grip soft but
horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords clammy fingers
were feeling for his throat then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder all he
could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creatures face
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had been alone but frodo sprang
up and drew sting from its sheath with his left hand he drew back gollums
head by his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcing his pale
venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he said this is sting you have seen it before once upon
a time let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string sam got up fingering his
shoulder his eyes smouldered with anger but he could not avenge himself: his
miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them hurt us precious they wont hurt us will
they nice little hobbitses we didnt mean no harm but they jumps on us like
cats on poor mices they did precious and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very nice if theyll be nice to us wont we yes
yess
well whats to be done with it  said sam tie it up so as it cant come
sneaking after us no more i say
but that would kill us kill us whimpered gollum cruel little hobbitses
tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us gollum gollum
sobs welled up in his gobbling throat
no said frodo if we kill him we must kill him outright but we cant do
that not as things are poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh hasnt he  said sam rubbing his shoulder anyway he meant to and
he means to ill warrant throttle us in our sleep thats his plan
i daresay said frodo but what he means to do is another matter he
paused for a while in thought gollum lay still but stopped whimpering sam
stood glowering over him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly but far off voices out
of the past:
what a pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature when he had a chance
pity it was pity that stayed his hand pity and mercy: not to strike
without need
i do not feel any pity for gollum he deserves death
deserves death i daresay he does many that live deserve death and some die
that deserve life can you give that to them then be not too eager to deal out
death in the name of justice fearing for your own safety even the wise cannot
see all ends
very well he answered aloud lowering his sword but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature for now that i see him i do
pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be speaking to some one who was not
there gollum lifted his head
yess wretched we are precious he whined misery misery hobbits wont
kill us nice hobbits
no we wont said frodo but we wont let you go either youre full of
wickedness and mischief gollum you will have to come with us thats all
while we keep an eye on you but you must help us if you can one good turn
deserves another
yess yes indeed said gollum sitting up nice hobbits we will come with
them find them safe paths in the dark yes we will and where are they going in
these cold hard lands we wonders yes we wonders  he looked up at them and a
faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking
eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his teeth but he seemed to sense that there
was something odd about his masters mood and that the matter was beyond
argument all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough sméagol
he said quietly and sternly we are going to mordor of course and you know
the way there i believe
ach sss  said gollum covering his ears with his hands as if such
frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him we guessed yes we
guessed he whispered and we didnt want them to go did we no precious
not the nice hobbits ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and pits
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses nice hobbits mustnt go to - sss -
those places
so you have been there  frodo insisted and youre being drawn back
there arent you
yess yess no  shrieked gollum once by accident it was wasnt it
precious yes by accident but we wont go back no no then suddenly his
voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat and spoke but not to
them leave me alone gollum you hurt me o my poor hands gollum
i we i dont want to come back i cant find it i am tired i we cant find
it gollum gollum no nowhere theyre always awake dwarves
men and elves terrible elves with bright eyes i cant find it ach  he got
up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the
east we wont  he cried not for you then he collapsed again gollum
gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground dont look at us go
away go to sleep
he will not go away or go to sleep at your command sméagol said
frodo but if you really wish to be free of him again then you must help me
and that i fear means finding us a path towards him but you need not go all the
way not beyond the gates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids hes over there
he cackled always there orcs will take you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river dont ask sméagol poor poor sméagol
he went away long ago they took his precious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
get up  said frodo
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff
now  said frodo can you find a path easier by day or by night were
tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined not under the white
face not yet it will go behind the hills soon yess rest a bit first nice
hobbits
then sit down said frodo and dont move
the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side with their
backs to the stony wall resting their legs there was no need for any
arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment slowly the
moon went by shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark before them
the stars grew thick and bright in the sky above no one stirred gollum sat
with his legs drawn up knees under chin flat hands and feet splayed on the
ground his eyes closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening
frodo looked across at sam their eyes met and they understood they relaxed
leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to soon the sound
of their soft breathing could be heard gollums hands twitched a little hardly
perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right and first one eye and then
the other opened a slit the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the ground with a
jump like a grasshopper or a frog gollum bounded forward into the darkness but
that was just what frodo and sam had expected sam was on him before he had gone
two paces after his spring frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful again sam he said
sam got out the rope and where were you off to in the cold hard lands mr
gollum he growled we wonders aye we wonders to find some of your
orc-friends i warrant you nasty treacherous creature its round your neck
this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks he did not answer sam but gave
him a swift venomous look
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo we want him to
walk so its no good tying his legs-or his arms he seems to use them nearly as
much tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gollum while sam tied the knot the result surprised them
both gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to hear he
writhed and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope he kept on
screaming
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in pain but it could not be
from the knot he examined it and found that it was not too tight indeed hardly
tight enough sam was gentler than his words whats the matter with you  he
said if you will try to run away you must be tied but we dont wish to hurt
you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum it freezes it bites elves
twisted it curse them nasty cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of
course it is precious we guessed they were cruel hobbits they visits elves
fierce elves with bright eyes take it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said frodo not unless - he paused a
moment in thought - not unless there is any promise you can make that i can
trust
we will swear to do what he wants yes yess said gollum still twisting
and grabbling at his ankle it hurts us
swear  said frodo
sméagol said gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide and
staring at frodo with a strange light sméagol will swear on the
precious
frodo drew himself up and again sam was startled by his words and his stern
voice on the precious how dare you  he said think
one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that sméagol it will hold
you but it is more treacherous than you are it may twist your words beware
gollum cowered on the precious on the precious  he repeated
and what would you swear  asked frodo
to be very very good said gollum then crawling
to frodos feet he grovelled before him whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over
him as if the words shook his very bones with fear sméagol will swear
never never to let him have it never sméagol will save it but he
must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo looking down at him
with stern pity all you wish is to see it and touch it if you can though you
know it would drive you mad not on it swear by it if you will for you know
where it is yes you know sméagol it is before you
for a moment it appeared to sam that his master had grown and gollum had
shrunk: a tall stern shadow a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey cloud
and at his feet a little whining dog yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien: they could reach one anothers minds gollum raised himself and began
pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
down down  said frodo now speak your promise
we promises yes i promise said gollum i will serve the master of the
precious good master good sméagol gollum
gollum suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
reluctantly sam obeyed at once gollum got up and began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has patted it from that moment a change which
lasted for some time came over him he spoke with less hissing and whining and
he spoke to his companions direct not to his precious self he would cringe and
flinch if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement and he avoided the
touch of their elven-cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxious
to please he would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest was made or
even if frodo spoke kindly to him and weep if frodo rebuked him sam said
little to him of any sort he suspected him more
deeply than ever and if possible liked the new gollum the sméagol less
than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you he said now for it
the moons gone and the nights going wed better start
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about off we go theres only one way
across between the north-end and the south-end i found it i did orcs dont
use it orcs dont know it orcs dont cross the marshes they go round for
miles and miles very lucky you came this way very
lucky you found sméagol yes follow sméagol
he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly like a dog inviting
them for a walk wait a bit gollum cried sam not too far ahead now im
going to be at your tail and ive got the rope handy
no no  said gollum sméagol promised
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off gollum led them
back northward for a while along the way they had come then he slanted to the
right away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down the broken stony slopes
towards the vast fens below they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of mordor there was a black
silence
 
gollum moved quickly with his head and neck thrust forward often using his
hands as well as his feet frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep up with
him but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping and if they fell
behind he would turn and wait for them after a time he brought them to the
brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before but they were now further
from the hills
here it is he cried there is a way down inside yes now we follows it -
out out away over there he pointed south and east towards the marshes the
reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and foul even in the cool night air

gollum cast up and down along the brink and at length he called to them
here we can get down here sméagol went this way once: i went this
way hiding from orcs
he led the way and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom it
was not difficult for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep
and about a dozen across there was running water at the bottom: it was in fact
the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to
feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond gollum turned to the right southward
more or less and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream he
seemed greatly delighted to feel the water and chuckled to himself sometimes
even croaking in a sort of song
the cold hard lands

they bites our hands

they gnaws our feet

the rocks and stones

are like old bones

all bare of meat

but stream and pool

is wet and cool:

so nice for feet

and now we wish -
ha ha what does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits well
tell you he croaked he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it a glint
came into his eyes and sam catching the gleam in the darkness thought it far
from pleasant
alive without breath

as cold as death

never thirsting ever drinking

clad in mail never clinking

drowns on dry land

thinks an island

is a mountain

thinks a fountain

is a puff of air

so sleek so fair

what a joy to meet

we only wish

to catch a fish

so juicy-sweet
these words only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that had been
troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was going to
adopt gollum as a guide: the problem of food it did not occur to him that his
master might also have thought of it hut he supposed gollum had indeed how had
gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering not too well thought sam
he looks fair famished not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there
aint no fish ill wager - supposing as he could catch us napping well he
wont: not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time or so it
seemed to the tired feet of frodo and sam the gully turned eastward and as
they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower at last the sky above
grew faint with the first grey of morning gollum had shown no signs of tiring
but now he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as if day was something
that might overhear him and spring on him sméagol will stay here: i
will stay here and the yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said frodo but we will stay here: we
are too tired to go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow
face said gollum it shows you up nice sensible hobbits stay with sméagol
orcs and nasty things are about they can see a long way stay and hide with me

the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the
gully it was not much more than a tall mans height now and at its base there
were wide flat shelves of dry stone the water ran in a channel on the other
side frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs gollum paddled
and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo are you hungry sméagol we
have very little to share but we will spare you what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in gollums pale eyes
and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face for a
moment he relapsed into his old gollum-manner we are famisshed yes famisshed
we are precious he said what is it they eats have they nice fisshes  his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo we have only got this - he held up a
wafer of lembas - and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum drink it drink it while we can but
what is it theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty 
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its
leaf-wrapping gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of
disgust came over it and a hint of his old malice
sméagol smells it  he said leaves out of the elf-country gah they
stinks he climbed in those trees and he couldnt wash the smell off his hands
my nice hands dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas
and nibbled it he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
ach no  he spluttered you try to choke poor sméagol dust and
ashes he cant eat that he must starve but sméagol doesnt mind nice
hobbits sméagol has promised he will starve he cant eat hobbits
food he will starve poor thin sméagol 
im sorry said frodo but i cant help you im afraid i think this food
would do you good if you would try but perhaps you cant even try not yet
anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in silence sam thought that it
tasted far better somehow than it had for a good while: gollums behaviour had
made him attend to its flavour again but he did not feel comfortable gollum
watched every morsel from hand to mouth like an expectant dog by a diners
chair only when they had finished and were preparing to rest was he apparently
convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in then he went
and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little
look here  sam whispered to frodo not too softly: he did not
really care whether gollum heard him or not weve got to get some sleep but
not both together with that hungry villain nigh promise or no promise sméagol
or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant you go to sleep
mr frodo and ill call you when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same as before while hes loose
perhaps youre right sam said frodo speaking openly there is a
change in him but just what kind of a change and how deep im not sure yet
seriously though i dont think there is any need for fear - at present still
watch if you wish give me about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept
almost as soon as he had spoken the words gollum seemed no longer to have any
fears he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned presently his
breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth hut he lay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop off himself if he sat listening to
his two companions breathing sam got up and gently prodded gollum his hands
uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement sam bent down and said fissh
close to his ear but there was no response not even a catch in gollums
breathing
sam scratched his head must really be asleep he muttered and if i was
like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again he restrained the thoughts of his
sword and the rope that sprang to his mind and went and sat down by his master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not lighter but darker than when they
had breakfasted sam leapt to his feet not least from his own feeling of vigour
and hunger he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nine
hours at least frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen various reproachful names for himself came to sams
mind drawn from the gaffers large paternal word-hoard then it also occurred
to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to
guard against they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch  he said half remorsefully now i wonder where hes got to 
not far not far  said a voice above him he looked up and saw the shape
of gollums large head and ears against the evening sky
here what are you doing  cried sam his suspicions coming back as soon as
he saw that shape
sméagol is hungry said gollum be back soon
come back now shouted sam hi come back but gollum had vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes hullo
he said anything wrong whats the time
i dunno said sam after sundown i reckon and hes gone off says hes
hungry
dont worry said frodo theres no help for it but hell come back
youll see the promise will hold yet a while and he wont leave his precious
anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours
with gollum and a very hungry gollum too loose beside them dont think of
any of your gaffers hard names he said you were worn out and it has turned
out well: we are now both rested and we have a hard road ahead the worst road
of all
about the food said sam how longs it going to take us to do this job
and when its done what are we going to do then this waybread keeps you on
your legs in a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper as
you might say: not to my feeling anyhow meaning no disrespect to them as made
it but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow i reckon
weve got enough to last say three weeks or so and that with a tight belt and
a light tooth mind you weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to - to finish said frodo we were
miserably delayed in the hills but samwise gamgee my dear hobbit - indeed sam
my dearest hobbit friend of friends - i do not think we need give thought to
what comes after that to do the job as you put it - what hope is there
that we ever shall and if we do who knows what will come of that if the one
goes into the fire and we are at hand i ask you sam are we ever likely to
need bread again i think not if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to mount
doom that is all we can do more than i can i begin to feel
sam nodded silently he took his masters hand and bent over it he did not
kiss it though his tears fell on it then he turned away drew his sleeve over
his nose and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and saying between
the efforts: wheres that dratted creature
it was actually not long before gollum returned but he came so quietly that
they did not hear him till he stood before them his fingers and face were
soiled with black mud he was still chewing and slavering what he was chewing
they did not ask or like to think
worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes thought sam brr the
nasty creature the poor wretch 
gollum said nothing to them until he had drunk
deeply and washed himself in the stream then he came up to them licking his
lips better now he said are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they
sleep beautifully trust sméagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last as they went
on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual its
bottom was less stony and more earthy and slowly its sides dwindled to mere
banks it began to wind and wander that night drew to its end but clouds were
now over moon and star and they knew of the coming of day only by the slow
spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water-course the banks became
moss-grown mounds over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled and
fell down into a brown bog and was lost dry reeds hissed and rattled though
they could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay stretching away
southward and eastward into the dim half-light mists curled and smoked from
dark and noisome pools the reek of them hung stifling in the still air far
away now almost due south the mountain-walls of mordor loomed like a black
bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gollum they did now know and
could not guess in that misty light that they were in fact only just within the
northern borders of the marshes the main expanse of which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lands with some delay have retraced their
steps a little and then turning east have come round over hard roads to the
bare plain of dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of
mordor not that there was great hope in such a course on that
stony plain there was no cover and across it ran the highways of the orcs and
the soldiers of the enemy not even the cloaks of lórien would have
concealed them there
how do we shape our course now sméagol  asked frodo must we
cross these evil-smelling fens 
no need no need at all said gollum not if hobbits want to reach the
dark mountains and go to see him very quick back a little and round a little
- his skinny arm waved north and east - and you can come on hard cold roads to
the very gates of his country lots of his people
will be there looking out for guests very pleased to take them straight to him
o yes his eye watches that way all the time it caught sméagol there
long ago gollum shuddered but sméagol has used his eyes since then
yes yes: ive used eyes and feet and nose since then l know other ways more
difficult not so quick but better if we dont want him to see follow sméagol
he can take you through the marshes through the mists nice thick mists follow
sméagol very carefully and you may go a long way quite a long
way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen morning and the marsh-reeks lay in
heavy banks no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed anxious to
continue the journey at once so after a brief rest they set out again and were
soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off from all view of the lands about
either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought they went
slowly in single file: gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow though they went he often
lagged the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really
an endless network of pools and soft mires and winding half-strangled
water-courses among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it his head on its long
neck was ever turning this way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the
time to himself sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them while he
went forward a little crouching testing the ground with fingers or toes or
merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome cold clammy winter still held sway in this
forsaken country the only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark greasy
surfaces of the sullen waters dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the
mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light increased a little and the mists lifted
growing thinner and more transparent far above the rot and vapours of the world
the sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of
dazzling foam but only a passing ghost of her could they see below bleared
pale giving no colour and no warmth but even at this faint reminder of her
presence gollum scowled and flinched he halted their journey and they rested
squatting like little hunted animals in the borders of a great brown
reed-thicket there was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces by the
faint quiver of empty seed-plumes and broken grass-blades trembling in small
air-movements that they could not feel
not a bird  said sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum nice birds  he licked his teeth no birds
here there are snakeses wormses things in the pools lots of things lots of
nasty things no birds he ended sadly sam looked at him with distaste
so passed the third day of their journey with gollum before the shadows of
evening were long in happier lands they went on again always on and on with
only brief halts these they made not so much for rest as to help gollum for
now even he had to go forward with great care and he was sometimes at a loss
for a while they had come to the very midst of the dead marshes and it was
dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line following attentively
every move that gollum made the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant
meres among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places
where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud the travellers were
light or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through
presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to
breathe when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going
queer he first saw one with the corner of his left eye a wisp of pale sheen
that faded away but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke
some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and there
they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands but neither of his
companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer whats all this gollum  he said in a
whisper these lights theyre all round us now are we trapped who are they

gollum looked up a dark water was before him and he was crawling on the
ground this way and that doubtful of the way yes they are all round us he
whispered the tricksy lights candles of corpses yes yes dont you heed
them dont look dont follow them wheres the master 
sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again he could not see him
he went some paces back into the darkness not daring to move far or to call in
more than a hoarse whisper suddenly he stumbled against frodo who was standing
lost in thought looking at the pale lights his hands hung stiff at his sides
water and slime were dripping from them
come mr frodo  said sam dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can - if
we can 
all right said frodo as if returning out of a dream im coming go on

hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot in some old root or
tussock he fell and came heavily on his hands which sank deep into sticky
ooze so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere there
was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up the lights flickered and danced and
swirled for a moment the water below him looked like some window glazed with
grimy glass through which he was peering wrenching his hands out of the bog
he sprang back with a cry there are dead things dead faces in the water he
said with horror dead faces 
gollum laughed the dead marshes yes yes: that is their names he
cackled you should not look in when the candles are lit
who are they what are they  asked sam shuddering turning to frodo who
was now behind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike voice but i have seen them too
in the pools when the candles were lit they lie in all the pools pale faces
deep deep under the dark water i saw them: grim faces and evil and noble faces
and sad many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair but all
foul all rotting all dead a fell light is in them frodo hid his eyes in his
hands i know not who they are but i thought i saw there men and elves and
orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum all dead all rotten
elves and men and orcs the dead marshes there was a great battle long ago
yes so they told him when sméagol was young when i was young before the
precious came it was a great battle tall men with long swords and terrible
elves and orcses shrieking they fought on the plain for days and months
at the black gates but the marshes have grown since then swallowed up the
graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam the dead cant be really there
is it some devilry hatched in the dark land 
who knows sméagol doesnt know answered gollum you cannot reach
them you cannot touch them we tried once yes precious i tried once but
you cannot reach them only shapes to see perhaps not to touch no precious
all dead
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again thinking that he guessed why sméagol
had tried to touch them well i dont want to see them he said never
again cant we get on and get away 
yes yes said gollum but slowly very
slowly very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light
little candles follow sméagol dont look at lights 
he crawled away to the right seeking for a path round the mere they came
close behind stooping often using their hands even as he did three precious
little gollums in a row we shall be if this goes on much longer thought sam
at last they came to the end of the black mere and they crossed it
perilously crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or falling hands-first into waters as noisome as
a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank
in one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared that he was pleased: in
some mysterious way by some blended sense of feel and smell and uncanny
memory for shapes in the dark he seemed to know just where he was again and to
be sure of his road ahead
now on we go  he said nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of
course so we are my precious all of us but we must take master away from the
wicked lights yes yes we must with these words he started off again almost
at a trot down what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds and they
stumbled after him as quickly as they could but in a little while he stopped
suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or
displeased again
what is it  growled sam misinterpreting the signs whats the need to
sniff the stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held you stink and master
stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks  answered gollum poor sméagol smells it
but good sméagol bears it helps nice master but thats no matter the
airs moving change is coming sméagol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uneasiness grew and every now and again he stood
up to his full height craning his neck eastward and southward for some time
the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him then suddenly all
three halted stiffening and listening to frodo and sam it seemed that they
heard far away a long wailing cry high and thin and cruel they shivered at
the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them and it grew
very cold as they stood straining their ears they heard a noise like a wind
coming in the distance the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
gollum would not move he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with
a rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the marshes the night
became less dark light enough for them to see or half see shapeless drifts of
fog curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them looking up
they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and then high in the south the moon
glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits but gollum
cowered down muttering curses on the white face then frodo and sam staring at
the sky breathing deeply of the fresher air saw it come: a small cloud flying
from the accursed hills a black shadow loosed from mordor a vast shape winged
and ominous it scudded across the moon and with a deadly cry went away
westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth but the shadow of
horror wheeled and returned passing lower now right above them sweeping the
fen-reek with its ghastly wings and then it was gone flying back to mordor
with the speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it the wind roared away
leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak the naked waste as far as the eye
could pierce even to the distant menace of the mountains was dappled with the
fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like children wakened from an evil
dream to find the familiar night still over the world but gollum lay on the
ground as if he had been stunned they roused him with difficulty and for some
time he would not lift his face but knelt forward on his elbows covering the
back of his head with his large flat hands
wraiths he wailed wraiths on wings the precious is their master they
see everything everything nothing can hide from them curse the white face
and they tell him everything he sees he knows ach gollum gollum
gollum  it was not until the moon had sunk westering far beyond tol
brandir that he would get up or make a move
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again he was
more fawning and would-be friendly but sam surprised some strange looks in his
eyes at times especially towards frodo and he went back more and more into his
old manner of speaking and sam had another growing anxiety frodo seemed to be
weary weary to the point of exhaustion he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke
at all and he did not complain but he walked like one who carries a load the
weight of which is ever increasing and he dragged along slower and slower so
that sam had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordor frodo felt the ring on
its chain about his neck grow more burdensome he was now beginning to feel it
as an actual weight dragging him earthwards but far more he was troubled by the
eye: so he called it to himself it was that more than the drag of the ring that
made him cower and stoop as he walked the eye: that horrible growing sense of a
hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud and
earth and flesh and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze naked
immovable so thin so frail and thin the veils were become that still warded
it off frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now
was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of the same sort but what went on in his
wretched heart between the pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring that
was so near and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron the
hobbits did not guess: frodo gave no thought to it sams mind was occupied
mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own
heart he put frodo in front of him now and kept a watchful eye on every
movement of his supporting him if he stumbled and trying to encourage him with
clumsy words
when day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer the
ominous mountains had already drawn the air was now clearer and colder and
though still far off the walls of mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the
edge of sight but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste the
marshes were at an end dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked
mud the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes barren and pitiless towards
the desert that lay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black stone like worms
shrinking lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could
find nothing to rest upon for two more nights they struggled on through the
weary pathless land the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and filled with
a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the road with gollum they
halted once more before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached up to
roofs of smoke and cloud out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and
broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away frodo
looked round in horror dreadful as the dead marshes had been and the arid
moors of the noman-lands more loathsome far was the country that the crawling
day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes even to the mere of dead faces
some haggard phantom of green spring would come but here neither spring nor
summer would ever come again here nothing lived not even the leprous growths
that feed on rottenness the gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling
muds sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their
entrails upon the lands about high mounds of crushed and powdered rock great
cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained stood like an obscene graveyard
in endless rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the desolation that lay before mordor: the lasting monument
to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were
made void a land defiled diseased beyond all healing - unless the great sea
should enter in and wash it with oblivion i feel sick said sam frodo did
not speak
for a while they stood there like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmare
lurks holding it off though they know that they can only come to morning
through the shadows the light broadened and hardened the gasping pits and
poisonous mounds grew hideously clear the sun was up walking among clouds and
long flags of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled the hobbits had no
welcome for that light unfriendly it seemed revealing them in their
helplessness - little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash-heaps of the
dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest for
a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag but foul
fumes leaked out of it catching their throats and choking them gollum was the
first to get up spluttering and cursing he rose and without a word or a glance
at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours frodo and sam crawled after him
until they came to a wide almost circular pit high-banked upon the west it was
cold and dead and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom in
this evil hole they cowered hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the
eye
the day passed slowly a great thirst troubled them but they drank only a
few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully which now as they looked
back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty the hobbits took it
in turn to watch at first tired as they were neither of them could sleep at
all but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud sam
dozed it was frodos turn to be on guard he lay back on the slope of the pit
but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him he looked up at the
smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out
of the past he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking until
forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling it was
evening frodo could not have called for he had
fallen asleep and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit gollum was by
him for a moment sam thought that he was trying to rouse frodo then he saw
that it was not so gollum was talking to himself sméagol was
holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it
squeak and hiss a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he
spoke
sméagol promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promised: to save our precious
not to let him have it - never but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders
i dont know i cant help it masters got it sméagol promised to
help the master
yes yes to help the master: the master of the precious but if we was
master then we could help ourselfs yes and still keep promises
but sméagol said he would be very very
good nice hobbit he took cruel rope off sméagols leg he speaks nicely
to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good good as fish sweet one but
to ourselfs not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of sméagol objected
then take it said the other and lets hold it ourselfs then we shall be
master gollum make the other hobbit the nasty suspicious hobbit make
him crawl yes gollum
but not the nice hobbit 
oh no not if it doesnt please us still hes a baggins my precious yes
a baggins a baggins stole it he found it and he said nothing nothing we
hates bagginses
no not this baggins
yes every baggins all peoples that keep the precious we must have it 
but hell see hell know hell take it from us 
he sees he knows he heard us make silly promises - against his orders
yes must take it the wraiths are searching must take it
not for him 
no sweet one see my precious: if we has it then we can escape even from
him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger
than wraiths lord sméagol gollum the great the gollum
eat fish every day three times a day fresh from the sea most precious gollum
must have it we wants it we wants it we wants it 
but theres two of them theyll wake too quick and kill us
whined sméagol in a last effort not now not yet
we wants it but - and here there was a long pause as if a new thought had
wakened not yet eh perhaps not she might help she might yes
no no not that way  wailed sméagol
yes we wants it we wants it 
each time that the second thought spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a jerk as sméagol
spoke again finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed
towards his neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching every move that
gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids to his simple mind ordinary
hunger the desire to eat hobbits had seemed the chief danger in gollum he
realized now that it was not so: gollum was feeling the terrible call of the
ring the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she
was one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings he
supposed then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone far enough and
were getting dangerous a great heaviness was in all his limbs but he roused
himself with an effort and sat up something warned him to be careful and not to
reveal that he had overheard the debate he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge
yawn
whats the time  he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth he stood up for a moment
tense and menacing and then he collapsed falling forward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank of the pit nice hobbits nice
sam  he said sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good sméagol to
watch but its evening dusk is creeping time to go
high time  thought sam and time we parted too yet it crossed his mind
to wonder if indeed gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with
them curse him i wish he was choked he muttered he stumbled down the bank
and roused his master
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed he had been dreaming the dark shadow
had passed and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease nothing
remained of it in his memory yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of
heart his burden was less heavy on him gollum welcomed him with dog-like
delight he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pawing at
frodos knees frodo smiled at him
come  he said you have guided us well and faithfully this is the last
stage bring us to the gate and then i will not ask you to go further bring us
to the gate and you may go where you wish - only not to our enemies
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened to the
gate master says yes he says so and good sméagol does what he asks o
yes but when we gets closer well see perhaps well see then it wont look
nice at all o no o no
go on with you  said sam lets get it over 
in the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their
way through the dead land they had not gone far before they felt once more the
fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape
swept over the marshes they halted cowering on the evil-smelling ground but
they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the menace passed
high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad-dûr after a
while gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time but it now
seemed more remote as if it were passing far above the clouds rushing with
terrible speed into the west gollum however was helpless with terror and was
convinced that they were being hunted that their approach was known
three times  he whimpered three times is a threat they feel us here
they feel the precious the precious is their master we cannot go any further
this way no its no use no use 
pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail it was not until frodo
commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that gollum would get up
again then at last he rose with a snarl and went before them like a beaten
dog
so they stumbled on through the weary end of the night and until the coming
of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothing
and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
 
before the next day dawned their journey to mordor was over the marshes and
the desert were behind them before them darkling against a pallid sky the
great mountains reared their threatening heads
upon the west of mordor marched the gloomy range
of ephel dúath the mountains of shadow and upon the north the broken
peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash but as these ranges
approached one another being indeed but parts of one great wall about the
mournful plains of lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of núrnen
amidmost they swung out long arms northward and between these arms there was a
deep defile this was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the entrance to the land
of the enemy high cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward
from its mouth were two sheer hills black-boned and bare upon them stood the
teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall in days long past they were built
by the men of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow of sauron and
his flight lest he should seek to return to his old realm but the strength of
gondor failed and men slept and for long years the towers stood empty then
sauron returned now the watch-towers which had fallen into decay were
repaired and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony-faced they were with dark window-holes staring north and east and west
and each window was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff the dark lord had built a
rampart of stone in it there was a single gate of iron and upon its battlement
sentinels paced unceasingly beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of orcs lurked ready at a
signal to issue forth like black ants going to war none could pass the teeth of
mordor and not feel their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew the
secret passwords that would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair even from a
distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon
the wall and the patrols before the gate they lay now peering over the edge of
a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of
the northmost buttress of ephel dúath winging the heavy air in a
straight flight a crow maybe would have flown but a furlong from their
hiding-place to the black summit of the nearer tower a faint smoke curled above
it as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from the
watch-towers they blared and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the
hills came answering calls and further still
remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty
horns and drums of barad-dûr another dreadful day of fear and toil had
come to mordor and the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep
halls and the day-guards evil-eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are  said sam heres the gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get my word but the gaffer would
have a thing or two to say if he saw me now often said id come to a bad end
if i didnt watch my step he did but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old
fellow again hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam: mores the
pity he could go on telling me as long as hed got breath if only i could see
his old face again but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking "what way do we go now" we cant go
no further-unless we want to ask the orcs for a lift
no no  said gollum no use we cant go further sméagol said so
he said: well go to the gate and then well see and we do see o yes my
precious we do see sméagol knew hobbits could not go this way o yes
sméagol knew 
then what the plague did you bring us here for  said sam not feeling in
the mood to be just or reasonable
master said so master says: bring us to the gate so good sméagol
does so master said so wise master
i did said frodo his face was grim and set but resolute he was filthy
haggard and pinched with weariness but he cowered no longer and his eyes were
clear i said so because i purpose to enter mordor and i know no other way
therefore i shall go this way i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master  wailed gollum pawing at him and seeming in great
distress no use that way no use dont take the precious to him hell eat us
all if he gets it eat all the world keep it nice master and be kind to sméagol
dont let him have it or go away go to nice places and give it back to little
sméagol yes yes master: give it back eh sméagol will keep it
safe he will do lots of good especially to nice hobbits hobbits go home
dont go to the gate 
i am commanded to go to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said
frodo if there is only one way then i must take it what comes after must
come
sam said nothing the look on frodos face was enough for him he knew that
words of his were useless and after all he never had any real hope in the
affair from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope
as long as despair could be postponed now they were come to the bitter end but
he had stuck to his master all the way that was what he had chiefly come for
and he would still stick to him his master would not go to mordor alone sam
would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet he knelt at frodos
feet wringing his hands and squeaking not this
way master  he pleaded there is another way o yes indeed there is another
way darker more difficult to find more secret but sméagol knows it
let sméagol show you 
another way  said frodo doubtfully looking down at gollum with searching
eyes
yess yess indeed there was another
way sméagol found it lets go and see if its still there 
you have not spoken of this before
no master did not ask master did not say what he meant to do he does not
tell poor sméagol he says: sméagol take me to the gate - and
then good bye sméagol can run away and be good but now he says: i
purpose to enter mordor this way so sméagol is very afraid he does not
want to lose nice master and he promised master made him promise to save the
precious but master is going to take it to him straight to the black hand if
master will go this way so sméagol must save them both and he thinks of
another way that there was once upon a time nice master sméagol very
good always helps
sam frowned if he could have bored holes in gollum with his eyes he would
have done his mind was full of doubt to all appearances gollum was genuinely
distressed and anxious to help frodo but sam remembering the overheard debate
found it hard to believe that the long submerged sméagol
had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the
debate sams guess was that the sméagol and gollum halves or what in
his own mind he called slinker and stinker had made a truce and a
temporary alliance: neither wanted the enemy to get the ring both wished to
keep frodo from capture and under their eye as long as possible - at any rate
as long as stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his precious whether
there really was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old villain dont know what master
means to do he thought if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put an end to
his precious for good and all thered be trouble pretty quick i bet anyhow
old stinker is so frightened of the enemy - and hes under orders of some kind
from him or was - that hed give us away rather than be caught helping us and
rather than let his precious be melted maybe at least thats my idea and i
hope the master will think it out carefully hes as wise as any but hes
soft-hearted thats what he is its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do
next
frodo did not answer gollum at once while these doubts were passing through
sams slow but shrewd mind he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith
gorgor the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a
low hill at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between
it and the outer buttresses of the mountains in the midst of the valley stood
the black foundations of the western watch-tower by morning-light the roads
that converged upon the gate of mordor could now be clearly seen pale and
dusty one winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards into the mists
that clung about the feet of ered lithui and a third that ran towards him as
it bent sharply round the tower it entered a narrow defile and passed not far
below the hollow where he stood westward to his right it turned skirting the
shoulders of the mountains and went off southwards
into the deep shadows that mantled all the western sides of ephel dúath
beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and
the great river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on
the plain it seemed as if whole armies were on the march though for the most
part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes
beyond but here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets and over
the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many companies he
remembered his vision from afar upon amon hen so few days before though now it
seemed many years ago then he knew that the hope that had for one wild moment
stirred in his heart was vain the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in
greeting this was no assault upon the dark lord by the men of gondor risen
like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long passed away these were men
of other race out of the wide eastlands gathering to the summons of their
overlord armies that had encamped before his gate by night and now marched in
to swell his mounting power as if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of
their position alone in the growing light of day so near to this vast menace
frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head and stepped down
into the dell then he turned to gollum
sméagol he said i will trust you once more lndeed it seems that
i must do so and that it is my fate to receive help from you where i
least looked for it and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil
purpose so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance at sam for
twice now we have been in your power and you have done no harm to us nor have
you tried to take from me what you once sought may the third time prove the
best but i warn you sméagol you are in danger
yes yes master  said gollum dreadful
danger sméagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run away he
must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo i mean a danger
to yourself alone you swore a promise by what you call the precious remember
that it will hold you to it but it will seek a way to twist it to your own
undoing already you are being twisted you revealed yourself to me just now
foolishly give it back to sméagol
you said do not say that again do not let that thought grow in you
you will never get it back but the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end
you will never get it back in the last need sméagol i should put on
the precious and the precious mastered you long ago if i wearing it were to
command you you would obey even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast
yourself into the fire and such would be my command so have a care sméagol
sam looked at his master with approval but also with surprise: there was a
look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before it had
always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a
high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness of course he also
firmly held the incompatible belief that mr frodo was the wisest person in the
world with the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf gollum in
his own way and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much briefer may
have _made a similar mistake confusing kindness and blindness at any rate this
speech abashed and terrified him he grovelled on the ground and could speak no
clear words but nice master
frodo waited patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly come
now gollum or sméagol if you wish tell me of this other way and show
me if you can what hope there is in it enough to justify me in turning aside
from my plain path i am in haste
but gollum was in a pitiable state and frodos threat had quite unnerved
him it was not easy to get any clear account out of him amid
his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled
on the floor and begged them both to be kind to poor little sméagol
after a while he grew a little calmer and frodo gathered bit by bit that if a
traveller followed the road that turned west of ephel dúath he would
come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees on the right a road went
down to osgiliath and the bridges of the anduin in the middle the road went on
southwards
on on on said gollum we never went that way but they say it goes a
hundred leagues until you can see the great water that is never still there
are lots of fishes there and big birds eat fishes: nice birds: but we never
went there alas no we never had a chance and further still there are more
lands they say but the yellow face is very hot there and there are seldom any
clouds and the men are fierce and have dark faces we do not want to see that
land
no  said frodo but do not wander from your road what of the third
turning 
o yes o yes there is a third way said gollum that is the road to the
left at once it begins to climb up up winding and climbing back towards the
tall shadows when it turns round the black rock youll see it suddenly youll
see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it what will you see 
the old fortress very old very horrible now we used to hear tales from
the south when sméagol was young long ago o yes we used to tell lots
of tales in the evening sitting by the banks of the great river in the
willow-lands when the river was younger too gollum gollum he
began to weep and mutter the hobbits waited patiently
tales out of the south gollum went on again about the tall men with the
shining eyes and their houses like hills of stone and the silver crown of
their king and his white tree: wonderful tales they built very tall towers and
one they raised was silver-white and in it there was a stone like the moon and
round it were great white walls o yes there were many tales about the tower of
the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son of elendil built  said
frodo it was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he has only four on the black hand but they are enough said gollum
shuddering and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate  said frodo but what has the tower of the moon to
do with us 
well master there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the white
houses and the wall but not nice now not beautiful he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible place now travellers shiver when they see it they creep
out of sight they avoid its shadow but master will have to go that way that
is the only other way for the mountains are lower there and the old road goes
up and up until it reaches a dark pass at the top and then it goes down down
again - to gorgoroth his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will that help us  asked sam surely the enemy knows all about
his own mountains and that road will be guarded as close as this the tower
isnt empty is it 
o no not empty  whispered gollum it seems empty but it isnt o no
very dreadful things live there orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse
things live there too the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and
passes the gate nothing moves on the road that they dont know about the
things inside know: the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that we should go another long
march south to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one when we get
there if we ever do 
no no indeed said gollum hobbits must see must try to understand he
does not expect attack that way his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than to others he cant see everything all at once not yet you
see he has conquered all the country west of the shadowy mountains down to the
river and he holds the bridges now he thinks no one can come to the moontower
without fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of boats which they
cannot hide and he will know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes doing and thinking said sam have
you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing with orcs 
not nice hobbit not sensible said gollum
giving sam an angry glance and turning to frodo sméagol has talked to
orcs yes of course before he met master and to many peoples: he has walked
very far and what he says now many peoples are saying its here in the north that
the big danger is for him and for us he will come out of the black gate one
day one day soon that is the only way big armies can come but away down west
he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so  said sam not to be put off and so we are to walk up and knock
at their gate and ask if were on the right road for mordor or are they too
silent to answer its not sense we might as well do it here and save
ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum it isnt funny o no not
amusing its nut sense to try and get into mordor at all but if master says i
must go or i will go then he must try
some way but he must not go to the terrible city o no of course not that is
where sméagol helps nice sméagol though no one tells him what it
is all about sméagol helps again he found it he knows it
what did you find  asked frodo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again a little path
leading up into the mountains: and then a stair a
narrow stair o yes very long and narrow and then more stairs and then - his
voice sank even lower - a tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass it was that way that sméagol got out
of the darkness but it was years ago the path may have vanished now
but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound of it at all said sam sounds too easy at any rate
in the telling if that path is still there itll be guarded too wasnt it
guarded gollum  as he said this he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam
in gollums eye gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded  asked frodo sternly and did you escape
out of the darkness sméagol were you not rather permitted to depart
upon an errand that at least is w hat aragorn thought who found you by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie  hissed gollum and an evil light came into his eyes at the
naming of aragorn he lied on me yes he did i did escape all by my poor
self indeed i was told to seek for the precious and i have searched and
searched of course i have but not for the black one the precious was ours it
was mine i tell you i did escape
frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter gollum was for once not so
far from the truth as might be suspected that he had somehow found a way out of
mordor and at least believed that it was by his own cunning for one thing he
noted that gollum used i and that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare
appearances that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment
on top but even if gollum could be trusted on this point frodo did not forget
the wiles of the enemy the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal
back
i ask you again he said: is not this secret way guarded 
but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood he had all the
injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth or part of
it he did not answer
is it not guarded  frodo repeated
yes yes perhaps no safe places in this country said gollum sulkily no
safe places but master must try it or go home  no other way they could not
get him to say more the name of the perilous place and the high pass he could
not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadful rumour aragorn could perhaps
have told them that name and its significance: gandalf would have warned them
but they were alone and aragorn was far away and gandalf stood amid the ruin
of isengard and strove with saruman delayed by treason yet even as he spoke
his last words to saruman and the palantír
crashed in fire upon the steps of orthanc his thought was ever upon frodo and
samwise over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity
maybe frodo felt it not knowing it as he had upon amon hen even though he
believed that gandalf was gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent his head bowed striving to
recall all that gandalf had said to him but for this choice he could recall no
counsel indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon too soon
while the dark land was still very far away how
they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said perhaps he could not say
into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into dol guldur he had once
ventured but into mordor to the mountain of fire and to barad-dûr since
the dark lord rose in power again had he ever journeyed there frodo did
not think so and here he was a little halfling from the shire a simple hobbit
of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where the great ones could not
go or dared not go it was an evil fate but he had taken it on himself in his
own sitting-room in the far-off spring of another year so remote now that it
was like a chapter in a story of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom this was an evil choice which way should he choose
and if both led to terror and death what good lay in choice
the day drew on a deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where they
lay so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could be felt
as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world about them
above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke but it seemed high
and far away as if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits
sitting there under the weight of doom silent µ not moving shrouded in
their thin grey cloaks for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum a
tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of
some child of men its ragged garment still clinging to it its long arms and
legs almost bone-white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed over his knees but sam leaned back with hands behind
his head staring out of his hood at the empty sky at least for a long while it
was empty then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird-like figure wheel into
the circle of his sight and hover and then wheel away again two more
followed and then a fourth they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of pinion flying at a great
height he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering the same warning fear
was on him as he had felt in the presence of the black riders the helpless
horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon though
now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote but menace
it was frodo felt it too his thought was broken he stirred and shivered but
he did not look up gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider the
winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath the riders are about again up in the air he said
in a hoarse whisper i saw them do you think they could see us they were very
high up and if they are black riders same as before then they cant see much
by daylight can they 
no perhaps not said frodo but their steeds could see and these winged
creatures that they ride on now they can probably see more than any other
creature they are like great carrion birds they are looking for something: the
enemy is on the watch i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken for some
time they had been cut off from the world as if in an invisible island now
they were laid bare again peril had returned but still frodo did not speak to
gollum or make his choice his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory at last he stirred and stood up and
it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide but hark he said what
is that
a new fear was upon them they heard singing and hoarse shouting at first it
seemed a long way off but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them it leaped
into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and had sent armed
soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of
sauron they crouched listening the voices and the clink of weapons and
harness were very close frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their
sheaths flight was impossible
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow very
cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he could peer over it between
two broken points of stone he remained there without moving for some time
making no sound presently the voices began to recede again and then they
slowly faded away far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon then
quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low voice dark faces we have not
seen men like these before no sméagol has not they are fierce they
have black eyes and long black hair and gold rings in their ears yes
lots of beautiful gold and some have red paint on their cheeks and red cloaks
and their flags are red and the tips of their spears and they have round
shields yellow and black with big spikes not nice very cruel wicked men they
look almost as bad as orcs and much bigger sméagol
thinks they have come out of the south beyond the great rivers end: they came
up that road they have passed on to the black gate but more may follow always
more people coming to mordor one day all the peoples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his fear in his eagerness
for news of strange places
no no oliphaunts what are oliphaunts  said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behind his back as he always did when
speaking poetry and began:
grey as a mouse

big as a house

nose like a snake

i make the earth shake

as i tramp through the grass

trees crack as i pass

with horns in my mouth

i walk in the south

flapping big ears

beyond count of years

i stump round and round

never lie on the ground

not even to die

oliphaunt am i

biggest of all

huge old and tall

if ever youd met me

you wouldnt forget me

if you never do

you wont think im true

but old oliphaunt am i

and i never lie
that said sam when he had finished reciting thats a rhyme we have in
the shire nonsense maybe and maybe not but we have our tales too and news
out of the south you know in the old days hobbits used to go on their travels
now and again not that many ever came back and not that all they said was
believed: news from bree and not sure as shiretalk as the
sayings go but ive heard tales of the big folk down away in the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride on oliphaunts tis said when
they fight they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all and
the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another so when you said "men
out of the south all in red and gold" i said "were there any
oliphaunts " for if there was i was going to take a look risk or no but
now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt maybe there aint no such a
beast he sighed
no no oliphaunts said gollum again sméagol has not heard of
them he does not want to see them he does not want them to be sméagol
wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer sméagol wants master
to go nice master wont he come with sméagol 
frodo stood up he had laughed in the midst of all his cares when sam trotted
out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt and the
laugh had released him from hesitation i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts
with gandalf on a white one at their head he said then wed break a way into
this evil land perhaps but weve not just our own tired legs thats all
well sméagol the third turn may turn the best i will come with
you
good master wise master nice master cried gollum in delight patting
frodos knees good master then rest now nice hobbits under the shadow of
the stones close under the stones rest and lie quiet till the yellow face
goes away then we can go quickly soft and quick as shadows we must be
 
for the few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting into the
shade as the sun moved until at last the shadow of the western rim of their
dell grew long and darkness filled all the hollow then they ate a little and
drank sparingly gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lips good water runs down in streams
to the great river nice water in the lands we are going to sméagol will
get food there too perhaps hes very hungry yes gollum he
set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green light came
into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set out creeping over the westward rim
of the dell and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of
the road: the moon was now three nights from the full but it did not climb over
the mountains until nearly midnight and the early night was very dark a single
red light burned high up in the towers of the teeth but otherwise no sign could
be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled stumbling
through a barren stony country they did not dare to take the road but they
kept it on their left following its line as well as they could at a little
distance at last when night was growing old and they were already weary for
they had taken only one short rest the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and
then vanished: they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains
and were heading southwards
with hearts strangely lightened they now rested again but not for long they
were not going quick enough for gollum by his reckoning it was nearly thirty
leagues from the morannon to the cross-roads above osgiliath and he hoped to
cover that distance in four journeys so soon they struggled on once more until
the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude they had then walked
almost eight leagues and the hobbits could not have gone any further even if
they had dared
the growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up ominously on their left but near at hand they
could see the southward road now bearing away from the black roots of the hills
and slanting westwards beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like
dark clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown with ling and
broom and cornel and other shrubs that they did not know here and there they
saw knots of tall pine-trees the hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in
spite of weariness: the air was fresh and fragrant and it reminded them of the
uplands of the northfarthing far away it seemed good to be reprieved to walk
in a land that had only been for a few years under the dominion of the dark lord
and was not yet fallen wholly into decay but they did not forget their danger
nor the black gate that was still all too near hidden though it was behind the
gloomy heights they looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
the day passed uneasily they lay deep in the heather and counted out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change for they were still under the
shadows of the ephel dúath and the sun was veiled frodo slept at times
deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum or too tired to trouble about him
but sam found it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum was
plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams hunger
perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good
homely meal something hot out of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night they
started out again in a little while gollum led them down on to the southward
road and after that they went on more quickly though the danger was greater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead or
following them from behind but the night passed and they heard no sound of
walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps thirty miles
below the morannon it had been newly repaired but as it went south the wild
encroached upon it the handiwork of men of old could still be seen in its
straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way through
hillside slopes or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry but at last all signs of stonework faded save for a broken pillar here
and there peering out of bushes at the side or old paving-stones still lurking
amid weeds and moss heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung
the banks or sprawled out over the surface it dwindled at last to a country
cart-road little used but it did not wind: it held on its own sure course and
guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into the northern marches of that land that men once called
ithilien a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams the night
became fine under star and round moon and it seemed to the hobbits that the
fragrance of the air grew as they went forward and from the blowing and
muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticed it too and did not relish it at
the first signs of day they halted again they had come to the end of a long
cutting deep and sheer-sided in the middle by which the road clove its way
through a stony ridge now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and they saw that the mountains were now much
further off receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down into dim hazes far
below all about them were small woods of resinous trees fir and cedar and
cypress and other kinds unknown in the shire with wide glades among them and
everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs the long
journey from rivendell had brought them far south of their own land but not
until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of
clime here spring was already busy about them: fronds pierced moss and mould
larches were green-fingered small flowers were opening in the turf birds were
singing ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled
dryad loveliness
south and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of anduin shielded
from the east by the ephel dúath and yet not under the
mountain-shadow protected from the north by the emyn muil open to the southern
airs and the moist winds from the sea far away many great trees grew there
planted long ago falling into untended age amid a riot of careless descendants
and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of olive
and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles and thymes that grew in bushes
or with their woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones
sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or pale green and
marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys and many herbs of forms and scents beyond
the garden-lore of sam the grots and rocky walls were already starred with
saxifrages and stonecrops primeroles and anemones were awake in the
filbert-brakes and asphodel and many lily-flowers nodded their half-opened
heads in the grass: deep green grass beside the pools where falling streams
halted in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill as they
walked brushing their way through bush and herb sweet odours rose about them
gollum coughed and retched but the hobbits breathed deep and suddenly sam
laughed for hearts ease not for jest they followed a stream that went quickly
down before them presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow
dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin the carven rim of
which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles iris-swords stood
in ranks about it and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-rippling
surface but it was deep and fresh and spilled ever softly out over a stony lip
at the far end
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling freshet
then they sought for a resting-place and a hiding-place: for this land
fair-seeming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy they had not
come very far from the road and yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made by the orcs and other foul
servants of the dark lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn down
wantonly and left to die with evil runes or the fell sign of the eye cut in
rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake smelling and touching the
unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful for the moment of mordor was reminded
suddenly of their ever-present peril he stumbled on a ring still scorched by
fire and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and broken bones and
skulls the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine and trailing
clematis was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and
slaughter but it was not ancient he hurried back to his companions but he
said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by
gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said not lower down higher up for
me
a little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last years
fern beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank
that was crowned with old cedars here they decided to rest and pass the day
which already promised to be bright and warm a good day for strolling on their
way along the groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun the
sunlight there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch
and other evil eyes were abroad: sauron had many servants gollum in any case
would not move under the yellow face soon it would look over the dark
ridges of the ephel dúath and he would faint and cower in the light and
heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched now that the
despair of the impassable gate was behind him he did not feel so inclined as
his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their
errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the elves for
worse times ahead six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had
only a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the fire in that time well be lucky at this rate  he
thought and we might be wanting to get back we might 
besides at the end of a long night-march and after bathing and drinking he
felt even more hungry than usual a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted an idea struck him and he
turned to gollum gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own and he was
crawling away on all fours through the fern
hi gollum  said sam where are you going hunting well see here old
noser you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change myself your
new mottos always ready to help could you find anything fit for a
hungry hobbit 
yes perhaps yes said gollum sméagol always helps if
they asks - if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask and if that isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappeared he was away some time and frodo after a few mouthfuls of
lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep sam looked at
him the early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the
trees but he saw his masters face very clearly and his hands too lying at
rest on the ground beside him he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wound then as he had kept watch
sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within but
now the light was even clearer and stronger frodos face was peaceful the
marks of fear and care had left it but it looked old old and beautiful as if
the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had
before been hidden though the identity of the face was not changed not that
sam gamgee put it that way to himself he shook his head as if finding words
useless and murmured: i love him hes like that and sometimes it shines
through somehow but i love him whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder looking at frodo he
shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound sam came to him a moment later
and found him chewing something and muttering to himself on the ground beside
him lay two small rabbits which he was beginning to eye greedily
sméagol always helps he said he has brought rabbits nice
rabbits but master has gone to sleep and perhaps sam wants to sleep doesnt
want rabbits now sméagol tries to help but he cant catch things all in
a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbit at all and said so at least not to
cooked rabbit all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to learn the art
before their letters which many never reach: but sam was a good cook even by
hobbit reckoning and he had done a good deal of the camp-cooking on their
travels when there was a chance he still hopefully carried some of his gear in
his pack: a small tinder-box two small shallow pans the smaller fitting into
the larger inside them a wooden spoon a short two-pronged fork and some
skewers were stowed and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a
dwindling treasure some salt but he needed a fire and other things besides
he thought for a bit while he took out his knife cleaned and whetted it and
began to dress the rabbits he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even
for a few minutes
now gollum he said ive another job for you go and fill these pans
with water and bring em back 
sméagol will fetch water yes said gollum but what does the
hobbit want all that water for he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam if you cant guess youll soon find out and
the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn dont you damage one of
my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo he was still sleeping
quietly but sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands too
thin and drawn he is he muttered not right for a hobbit if i can get these
coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern and then scrambled up the bank
collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supply he cut out some turves at the foot of the bank
just outside the fern-brake and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going it made
little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent he was just stooping over his
fire shielding it and building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned
carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw what sam was doing he gave a
thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry ach sss -
no he cried no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum fire fire its
dangerous yes it is it burns it kills and it will bring enemies yes it
will
i dont think so said sam dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother but if it does it does im going to risk it
anyhow im going to stew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay spoil beautiful meat sméagol
saved for you poor hungry sméagol what for what for silly hobbit
they are young they are tender they are nice eat them eat them he clawed
at the nearest rabbit already skinned and lying by the fire
now now  said sam each to his own fashion our bread chokes you and
raw coney chokes me if you give me a coney the coneys mine see to cook if
i have a mind and i have you neednt watch me go and catch another and eat it
as you fancy - somewhere private and out o my sight then you wont see the
fire and i shant see you and well both be the happier ill see the fire
dont smoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into the fern sam busied himself with
his pans what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himself is some herbs
and roots especially taters - not to mention bread herbs we can manage
seemingly
gollum he called softly third time pays for all i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his looks were neither helpful nor
friendly a few bay-leaves some thyme and sage will do - before the water
boils said sam
no  said gollum sméagol is not pleased and sméagol
doesnt like smelly leaves he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not
till hes starving or very sick poor sméagol 
sméagolll get into real true hot water when this water boils if he
dont do as hes asked growled sam samll put his head in it yes precious
and id make him look for turnips and carrots and taters too if it was
the time o the year ill bet theres all sorts of good things running wild in
this country id give a lot for half a dozen taters
sméagol wont go o no precious not this time hissed gollum hes
frightened and hes very tired and this hobbits not nice not nice at all sméagol
wont grub for roots and carrotses and - taters whats taters precious eh
whats taters
po-ta-toes said sam the gaffers delight and rare good ballast for an
empty belly but you wont find any so you neednt
look but be good sméagol and fetch me the herbs and ill think better
of you whats more if you turn over a new leaf and keep it turned ill cook
you some taters one of these days i will: fried fish and chips served by s
gamgee you couldnt say no to that
yes yes we could spoiling nice fish scorching it give me fish now
and keep nassty chips 
oh youre hopeless said sam go to sleep
in the end he had to find what he wanted for himself but he did not have to
go far not out of sight of the place where his master lay still sleeping for
a while sam sat musing and tending the fire till the water boiled the daylight
grew and the air became warm the dew faded off turf and leaf soon the rabbits
cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs almost sam fell
asleep as the time went by he let them stew for close on an hour testing them
now and again with his fork and tasting the broth
when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire and crept
along to frodo frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him and then he
wakened from his dreaming: another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo sam  he said not resting is anything wrong what is the time 
about a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh on half past
eight by shire clocks maybe but nothings wrong though it aint quite what
id call right: no stock no onions no taters ive got a bit of a stew for
you and some broth mr frodo do you good youll have to sup it in your mug
or straight from the pan when its cooled a bit i havent brought no bowls
nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretched you should have been resting sam he said and
lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts but i do feel hungry hmm can i
smell it from here what have you stewed 
a present from sméagol said sam: a brace o young coneys though i
fancy gollums regretting them now but theres nought to go with them but a few
herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew from the
pans sharing the old fork and spoon they allowed themselves half a piece of
the elvish waybread each it seemed a feast
wheew gollum  sam called and whistled softly come on still time to
change your mind theres some left if you want to try stewed coney there was
no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself well finish
it said sam
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo i dont feel too sure of
him theres a good deal of stinker-the bad gollum if you understand me-in him
still and its getting stronger again not but what i think hed try to
throttle me first now we dont see eye to eye and hes not pleased with sam o
no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear as he stood
up to return he looked back up the slope at that moment he saw the sun rise
out of the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatever it was that lay ever to
the east and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey smoke plain to see as it caught the
sunlight rising from a thicket above him with a shock he realized that this
was the smoke from his little cooking-fire which he had neglected to put out
that wont do never thought it would show like that  he muttered and he
started to hurry back suddenly he halted and listened had he heard a whistle
or not or was it the call of some strange bird if it was a whistle it did not
come from frodos direction there it went again from another place sam began
to run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its outer end had kindled some
fern at the edge of the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves
smouldering hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire scattered the
ashes and laid the turves on the hole then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and what sounded like an answer  he asked a few
minutes back i hope it was only a bird but it didnt sound quite like that:
more like somebody mimicking a bird-call i thought and im afraid my bit of
fires been smoking now if ive gone and brought trouble ill never forgive
myself nor wont have a chance maybe 
hush  whispered frodo i thought i heard voices
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put them on ready for flight and
then crawled deeper into the fern there they crouched listening
there was no doubt of the voices they were speaking low and furtively but
they were near and coming nearer then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close
at hand
here here is where the smoke came from  it said twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt we shall have it like a coney in a trap then we shall
learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows  said a second voice
at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions
since flight and hiding were no longer possible frodo and sam sprang to their
feet putting back to back and whipping out their small swords
if they were astonished at what they saw their captors were even more
astonished four tall men stood there two had spears in their hands with broad
bright heads two had great bows almost of their own height and great quivers
of long green-feathered arrows all had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of
ithilien green gauntlets covered their hands and their faces were hooded and
masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen and bright at
once frodo thought of boromir for these men were like him in stature and
bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one but what have we found 
not orcs said another releasing the hilt of his sword which he had
seized when he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves  said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as it appeared the chief
among them elves do not walk in ithilien in these days and elves are wondrous
fair to look upon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam thank you kindly and when youve
finished discussing us perhaps youll say who you are and why you cant let
two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughed grimly i am faramir captain of gondor he
said but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the dark
tower or of the white
but we are neither said frodo and travellers we are whatever captain
faramir may say
then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand said faramir we
have a work to do and this is no time or place for riddling or parleying come
where is the third of your company 
the third 
yes the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down yonder
he had an ill-favoured look some spying breed of orc i guess or a creature of
theirs but he gave us the slip by some fox-trick
i do not know where he is said frodo he is only a chance companion met
upon our road and i am not answerable for him if you come on him spare him
bring him or send him to us he is only a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him under my care for a while but as for us we are hobbits of the shire far
to the north and west beyond many rivers frodo son of drogo is my name and
with me is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service we have come
by long ways - out of rivendell or imladris as some call it here faramir
started and grew intent seven companions we had: one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros: two of my kin a dwarf there was
also and an elf and two men they were aragorn and boromir who said that he
came out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir  all the four men exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denethor said faramir and a strange stern look
came into his face you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers that boromir son of denethor was high warden of the
white tower and our captain-general: sorely do we miss him who are you then
and what had you to do with him be swift for the sun is climbing
are the riddling words known to you that boromir brought to rivendell 
frodo replied
seek for the sword that was broken

in imladris it dwells
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment it is some token
of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken said
frodo and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see said faramir thoughtfully or i see that it might be so and
what is isildurs bane 
that is hidden answered frodo doubtless it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramir and know what brings you so far
east under the shadow of yonder- he pointed and said no name but not now we
have business in hand you are in peril and you would not have gone far by
field or road this day there will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the day
is full then death or swift flight bark to anduin i will leave two to guard
you for your good and for mine wise man trusts not to chance-meeting on the
road in this land if i return i will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low think what you will i am a friend of
all enemies of the one enemy we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as you seem and if my errand
permitted it may the light shine on your swords
the halflings are courteous folk whatever else they be said faramir
farewell
the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing to one another of their
thoughts and doubts close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay-trees two men remained on guard they took off their masks now and again to
cool them as the day-heat grew and frodo saw that they were goodly men
pale-skinned dark of hair with grey eyes and faces sad and proud they spoke
together in soft voices at first using the common speech but after the manner
of older days and then changing to another language of their own to his
amazement as he listened frodo became aware that
it was the elven-tongue that they spoke or one but little different and he
looked at them with wonder for he knew then that they must be dúnedain
of the south men of the line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and they were
rangers of ithilien for they were descended from folk who lived in ithilien at
one time before it was overrun from such men the lord denethor
chose his forayers who crossed the anduin secretly how or where they would
not say to harry the orcs and other enemies that roamed between the ephel dúath
and the river
it is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of anduin said mablung
and we seldom come so far afield but we have a new errand on this journey: we
come to ambush the men of harad curse them 
aye curse the southrons  said damrod  tis said that there were
dealings of old between gondor and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south
though there was never friendship in those days our bounds were away south
beyond the mouths of anduin and umbar the nearest of their realms
acknowledged our sway but that is long since tis many lives of men since any
passed to or fro between us now of late we have learned that the enemy has been
among them and they are gone over to him or back to him-they were ever ready
to his will-as have so many also in the east i doubt not that the days of
gondor are numbered and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great is his
strength and malice
but still we will not sit idle and let him do all as he would said
mablung these cursed southrons come now marching up the ancient roads to swell
the hosts of the dark tower yea up the very roads that craft of gondor made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that the power of their new
master is great enough so that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teach them another lesson great strength of them was reported to us
some days ago marching north one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon-up on the road above where it passes through the
cloven way the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures but his life is charmed or fate spares
him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence all seemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern-brake peered out with his keen
hobbit-eyes he saw that many more men were about he could see them stealing up
the slopes singly or in long files keeping always to the shade of grove or
thicket or crawling hardly visible in their brown and green raiment through
grass and brake all were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their hands
and were armed like faramir and his companions before long they had all passed
and vanished the sun rose till it neared the south the shadows shrank
i wonder where that dratted gollum is  thought sam as he crawled back
into deeper shade he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an orc or of
being roasted by the yellow face but i fancy hell look after himself he lay
down beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing he sat up it was now high
noon the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees suddenly the
horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also but the sound was faint
as if it came out of some distant cave then presently the noise of fighting
broke out near at hand just above their hiding-place he could hear plainly the
ringing grate of steel on steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull beat
of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming and one clear loud voice was
calling gondor gondor
it sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together said sam to
frodo theyre as near as i want them now
but the noise grew closer they are coming cried damrod see some of the
southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road there they go
our men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards he scrambled a little
way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees for a moment he caught a glimpse
of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off with green-clad
warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled arrows were thick in
the air then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank a man
fell crashing through the slender trees nearly on top of them he came to rest
in the fern a few feet away face downward green arrow-feathers sticking from
his neck below a golden collar his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet of
overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair braided
with gold were drenched with blood his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a
broken sword
it was sams first view of a battle of men against men and he did not like
it much he was glad that he could not see the dead face he wondered what the
mans name was and where he came from and if he was really evil of heart or
what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home and if he
would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash of thought
which was quickly driven from his mind for just as mablung stepped towards the
fallen body there was a new noise great crying and shouting amidst it sam
heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinning on the ground
ware ware cried damrod to his companion may the valar turn him aside mûmak
mûmak
to his astonishment and terror and lasting
delight sam saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the
slope big as a house much bigger than a house it looked to him a grey-clad
moving hill fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes but the
mûmak of harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk and the like of him
does not walk now in middle-earth his kin that live still in latter days are
but memories of his girth and majesty on he came straight towards the
watchers and then swerved aside in the nick of time passing only a few yards
away rocking the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees enormous
sail-like ears spread out long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to
strike his small red eyes raging his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with
bands of gold and dripped with blood his trappings of scarlet and gold flapped
about him in wild tatters the ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his furious passage through the woods and high
upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure-the body of a mighty
warrior a giant among the swertings
on the great beast thundered blundering in blind wrath through pool and
thicket arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his
flanks men of both sides fled before him but many he overtook and crushed to
the ground soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
what became of him sam never heard: whether he escaped to roam the wild for a
time until he perished far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit or
whether he raged on until he plunged in the great river and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breath an oliphaunt it was he said so there are
oliphaunts and i have seen one what a life but no one at home will ever
believe me well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung but the captain will return if he is
unhurt and when he comes we shall depart swiftly we shall be pursued as soon
as news of our deed reaches the enemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam no need to disturb my sleep i was
walking all night
mablung laughed i do not think the captain will leave you here master
samwise he said but you shall see
 
it seemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to
find that it was late afternoon and faramir had come back he had brought many
men with him indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the
slope nearby two or three hundred strong they sat in a wide semicircle
between the arms of which faramir was seated on the ground while frodo stood
before him it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid any attention to him and he
placed himself at the end of the rows of men where he could see and hear all
that was going on he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his
masters aid if needed he could see faramirs face which was now unmasked: it
was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance doubt
was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with frodos account
of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the company that set
out from rivendell why he had left boromir and where he was now going in
particular he returned often to isildurs bane plainly he saw that frodo was
concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that isildurs bane should waken
or so one must read the words he insisted if then you are the halfling that
was named doubtless you brought this thing whatever it may be to the council
of which you speak and there boromir saw it do you deny it 
frodo made no answer so  said faramir i wish then to learn from you
more of it for what concerns boromir concerns me an orc-arrow slew isildur so
far as old tales tell but orc-arrows are plenty and the sight of one would not
be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor had you this thing in keeping
it is hidden you say but is not that because you choose to hide it 
no not because i choose answered frodo it does not belong to me it
does not belong to any mortal great or small though if any could claim it it
would be aragorn son of arathorn whom i named the leader of our company from
moria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city that the sons of elendil
founded 
because aragorn is descended in direct lineage father to father from
isildur elendils son himself and the sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men some cried aloud:
the sword of elendil the sword of elendil comes to minas tirith great
tidings  but faramirs face was unmoved
maybe he said but so great a claim will need to be established and clear
proofs will be required should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith he had
not come nor any of your company when i set out six days ago
boromir was satisfied of that claim said frodo indeed if boromir were
here he would answer all your questions and since he was already at rauros
many days back and intended then to go straight to your city if you return
you may soon learn the answers there my part in the company was known to him
as to all the others for it was appointed to me by elrond of imladris himself
before the whole council on that errand i came into this country but it is not
mine to reveal to any outside the company yet those who claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam approved of it but it did
not appease faramir
so he said you bid me mind my own affairs and get me back home and let
you be boromir will tell all when he comes when he comes say you were you a
friend of boromir
vividly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs assault upon him
and for a moment he hesitated faramirs eyes watching him grew harder boromir
was a valiant member of our company  said frodo at length yes i was his
friend for my part
faramir smiled grimly then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead

i would grieve indeed said frodo then catching the look in faramirs
eyes he faltered dead he said do you mean that he is dead and that you
knew it you have been trying to trap me in words playing with me or are you
now trying to snare me with a falsehood
i would not snare even an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know of it since you say that none of
the company had reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his death i had hoped that his friend and companion
would tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong when we parted and he lives still for all that
i know though surely there are many perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation
these last words were more than he could bear and bursting into the middle of
the ring he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so after all youve gone through as much for his
good and all these great men as for anyone else
see here captain  he planted himself squarely in front of faramir his
hands on his hips and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offered him what he called sauce when questioned about visits to the
orchard there was some murmuring but also some grins on the faces of the men
looking on: the sight of their captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyond their
experience see here  he said what are you driving at lets come to the
point before all the orcs of mordor come down on us if you think my master
murdered this boromir and then ran away youve got no sense but say it and
have done and then let us know what you mean to do about it but its a pity
that folk as talk about fighting the enemy cant let others do their bit in
their own way without interfering hed be mighty pleased if he could see you
now think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without anger do not speak before your
master whose wit is greater than yours and i do not need any to teach me of
our peril even so i spare a brief time in order to judge justly in a hard
matter were i as hasty as you i might have slain you long ago for i am
commanded to slay all whom i find in this land without the leave of the lord of
gondor but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and not gladly even when it
is needed neither do i talk in vain so be comforted sit by your master and
be silent 
sam sat down heavily with a red face faramir turned to frodo again: you
asked how do i know that the son of denethor is dead tidings of death have many
wings night oft brings news to near kindred tis said boromir was my
brother
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face do you remember aught of special
mark that the lord boromir bore with him among his gear
frodo thought for a moment fearing some further trap and wondering how this
debate would turn in the end he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir and how he would fare now among so many men warlike and strong he
did not know yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he was much like his
brother in looks was a man less self-regarding both sterner and wiser i
remember that boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your minds eye: a great horn of the wild ox of
the east bound with silver and written with ancient characters that horn the
eldest son of our house has borne for many generations and it is said that if
it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of gondor as the realm was of
old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i set out on this venture eleven days ago at about this hour
of the day i heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it seemed but
dim as if it were but an echo in the mind a boding of ill we thought it my
father and i for no tidings had we heard of boromir since he went away and no
watcher on our borders had seen him pass and on the third night after another
and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in the grey dark under the young
pale moon watching the ever-moving stream and the sad reeds were rustling so
do we ever watch the shores nigh osgiliath which our enemies now partly hold
and issue from it to harry our lands but that night all the world slept at the
midnight hour then i saw or it seemed that i saw a boat floating on the
water glimmering grey a small boat of a strange fashion with a high prow and
there was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was round it but i rose and went to the
bank and began to walk out into the stream for i was drawn towards it then
the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace and floated slowly by within my
hands reach yet i durst not handle it it waded deep as if it were heavily
burdened and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost
filled with clear water from which came the light and lapped in the water a
warrior lay asleep
a broken sword was on his knee i saw many wounds on him it was boromir my
brother dead i knew his gear his sword his beloved face one thing only i
missed: his horn one thing only i knew not: a fair belt as it were of linked
golden leaves about his waist boromir i cried where is thy horn
whither goest thou o boromir but he was gone the boat turned into the
stream and passed glimmering on into the night dreamlike it was and yet no
dream for there was no waking and i do not doubt that he is dead and has
passed down the river to the sea
alas said frodo that was indeed boromir as
i knew him for the golden belt was given to him in lothlórien by the
lady galadriel she it was that clothed us as you see us in elven-grey this
brooch is of the same workmanship he touched the green and silver leaf
that fastened his cloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closely at it it is beautiful he said yes tis work of
the same craft so then you passed through the land of lórien laurelindórenan
it was named of old but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of
men he added softly regarding frodo with a new wonder in his eyes much that
was strange about you i begin now to understand will you not tell me more for
it is a bitter thought that boromir died within sight of the land of his home
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo though your tale fills
me with foreboding a vision it was that you saw i think and no more some
shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be unless indeed it is some lying
trick of the enemy i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old laid in sleep
beneath the pools of the dead marshes or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir for his works fill the heart with
loathing but my heart was filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth  asked frodo for no
boat could have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir and boromir
purposed to go home across the entwash and the fields of rohan and yet how
could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling
pools though laden with water 
i know not said faramir but whence came the boat 
from lórien said frodo in three such boats we rowed down anduin
to the falls they also were of elven-work
you passed through the hidden land said faramir but it seems that you
little understood its power if men have dealings with the mistress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow for
it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this sun and few of
old came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried what did she say to you the lady
that dies not what did she see what woke in your heart then why went you ever
to laurelindórenan and came not by your own road upon the horses of
rohan riding home in the morning
then turning again to frodo he spoke in a quiet voice once more to those
questions i guess that you could make some answer frodo son of drogo but not
here or now maybe but lest you still should think my tale a vision i will
tell you this the horn of boromir at least returned in truth and not in
seeming the horn came but it was cloven in two as it were by axe or sword
the shards came severally to shore: one was found among the reeds where watchers
of gondor lay northwards below the infalls of the entwash the other was found
spinning on the flood by one who had an errand in the water strange chances
but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of
denethor sitting in his high chair waiting for news and you can tell me
nothing of the cleaving of the horn 
no i did not know of it said frodo but the day when you heard it
blowing if your reckoning is true was the day when we parted when i and my
servant left the company and now your tale fills me with dread for if boromir
was then in peril and was slain i must fear that all my companions perished
too and they were my kindred and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go i am weary and full
of grief and afraid but i have a deed to do or to attempt before i too am
slain and the more need of haste if we two halflings are all that remain of
our fellowship
go back faramir valiant captain of gondor and defend your city while you
may and let me go where my doom takes me
for me there is no comfort in our speech together said faramir but you
surely draw from it more dread than need be unless
the people of lórien themselves came to him who arrayed boromir as for a
funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless some of your company i guess
live still
but whatever befell on the north march you frodo i doubt no longer if
hard days have made me any judge of mens words and faces then i may make a
guess at halflings though and now he smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvish air maybe but more lies upon our words together
than i thought at first i should now take you back to minas tirith to answer
there to denethor and my life will justly be forfeit if i now choose a course
that proves ill for my city so i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders at once the men who were
gathered round him broke up into small groups and went off this way and that
vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees soon only mablung and
damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose it will be
unsafe for some days and always more closely watched after this affray than it
has been yet and you cannot i think go far today in any case for you are
weary and so are we we are going now to a secret place we have somewhat less
than ten miles from here the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet
and if they did we could hold it long even against many there we may lie up
and rest for a while and you with us in the morning i will decide what is best
for me to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to fall in with this request or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment since this foray of the men
of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they set out at once: mablung and damrod a little ahead and faramir with
frodo and sam behind skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had
bathed they crossed the stream climbed a long bank and passed into
green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards while they
walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go they talked in hushed voices
i broke off our speech together said faramir not only because time
pressed as master samwise had reminded me but also because we were drawing
near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men it was for
that reason that i turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be isildurs
bane you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
i do not blame you said faramir you spoke with skill in a hard place
and wisely it seemed to me but i learned or guessed more from you than your
words said you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in
friendship you and master samwise too i guess have some grievance now i
loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his death yet i knew him well isildurs
bane - i would hazard that isildurs bane lay between you and was a
cause of contention in your company clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some
sort and such things do not breed peace among confederates not if aught may be
learned from ancient tales do i not hit near the mark
near said frodo but not in the gold there was no contention in our
company though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from the emyn
muil but be that as it may ancient tales teach us also the peril of rash words
concerning such things as - heirlooms
ah then it is as i thought: your trouble was with boromir alone he wished
this thing brought to minas tirith alas it is a crooked fate that seals your
lips who saw him last and holds from me that which i long to know: what was in
his heart and thought in his latest hours whether he erred or no of this i am
sure: he died well achieving some good thing his face was more beautiful even
than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at first about isildurs bane forgive
me it was unwise in such an hour and place i had not had time for thought we
had had a hard fight and there was more than enough to fill my mind but even
as i spoke with you i drew nearer to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is still preserved of
ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad we of my
house are not of the line of elendil though the blood of númenor is in
us for we reckon back our line to mardil the good steward who ruled in the
kings stead when he went away to war and that was king eärnur last of
the line of anárion and childless and he came never back and the
stewards have governed the city since that day though it was many generations
of men ago
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when we together learned the tale
of our sires and the history of our city that always it displeased him that his
father was not king "how many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward
a king if the king returns not " he asked "few years maybe in
other places of less royalty" my father answered "in gondor ten
thousand years would not suffice" alas poor boromir does that not tell
you something of him 
it does said frodo yet always he treated aragorn with honour
i doubt it not said faramir if he were satisfied of aragorns claim as
you say he would greatly reverence him but the pinch has not yet come they
had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars
but i stray we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore by long
tradition and there are moreover in our treasuries many things preserved: books
and tablets writ on withered parchments yea and on stone and on leaves of
silver and of gold in divers characters some none can now read and for the
rest few ever unlock them i can read a little in them for i have had
teaching it was these records that brought the grey pilgrim to us i first saw
him when i was a child and he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim  said frodo had he a name
mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said mithrandir
among the elves tharkûn to the dwarves olórin i was in my youth
in the west that is forgotten in the south incánus in the north
gandalf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo i thought it was he gandalf the grey dearest of
counsellors leader of our company he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost  said faramir an evil fate seems to have pursued
your fellowship it is hard indeed to believe that one of so great wisdom and
of power - for many wonderful things he did among us - could perish and so much
lore be taken from the world are you sure of this and that he did not just
leave you and depart where he would 
alas yes said frodo i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of dread in this said faramir which
perhaps you may tell me in the evening-time this mithrandir was i now guess
more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream he could
have made them clear to us without need of messenger yet maybe he would not
have done so and the journey of boromir was doomed mithrandir never spoke to
us of what was to be nor did he reveal his purposes he got leave of denethor
how i do not know to look at the secrets of our treasury and i learned a
little of him when he would teach and that was seldom ever he would search
and would question us above all else concerning the great battle that was fought
upon dagorlad in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name was
overthrown and he was eager for stories of isildur though of him we had less
to tell for nothing certain was ever known among us of his end
now faramirs voice sank to a whisper but this much i learned or guessed
and i have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that isildur took somewhat
from the hand of the unnamed ere he went away from gondor never to be seen
among mortal men again here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs
questioning but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after
ancient learning nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among
us did i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing for isildur
was ambushed and slain by orc-arrows according to the only legend that we knew
and mithrandir had never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess but some heirloom of power
and peril it must be a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark lord if it
were a thing that gave advantage in battle i can well believe that boromir the
proud and fearless often rash ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing and be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that errand i should have been chosen by my father
and the elders but he put himself forward as being the older and the hardier
both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thing if it lay by the highway not
were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone could save her so using the
weapon of the dark lord for her good and my glory no i do not wish for such
triumphs frodo son of drogo
neither did the council said frodo nor do i i would have nothing to do
with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white tree in flower again in
the courts of the kings and the silver crown return and minas tirith in peace:
minas anor again as of old full of light high and fair beautiful as a queen
among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress
of willing slaves war must be while we defend our
lives against a destroyer who would devour all but i do not love the bright
sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for its swiftness nor the warrior for
his glory i love only that which they defend: the city of the men of númenor
and i would have her loved for her memory her ancientry her beauty and
her present wisdom not feared save as men may fear the dignity of a man old
and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to tell me more i do not even ask you to
tell me whether i now speak nearer the mark but if you will trust me it may be
that i can advise you in your present quest whatever that be-yes and even aid
you
frodo made no answer almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel
to tell this grave young man whose words seemed so wise and fair all that was
in his mind but something held him back his heart was heavy with fear and
sorrow: if he and sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was now left of
the nine walkers then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words and the memory of boromir of the
dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in him was very present to
his mind when he looked at faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were
and yet also much akin
they walked on in silence for a while passing like grey and green shadows
under the old trees their feet making no sound above them many birds sang and
the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of
ithilien
sam had taken no part in the conversation though he had listened and at the
same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland
noises about them one thing he had noted that in all the talk the name of
gollum had not once come up he was glad though he felt that it was too much to
hope that he would never hear it again he soon became aware also that though
they walked alone there were many men close at hand: not only damrod and
mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead but others on either side all
making their swift secret way to some appointed place
once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the skin told him that he
was watched from behind he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behind a tree-trunk he opened his mouth to speak and shut it
again im not sure of it he said to himself and why should i remind them
of the old villain if they choose to forget him i wish i could
so they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to
fall more steeply then they turned aside again to the right and came quickly
to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that trickled far
above out of the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping down over
many stones in a deep-cloven bed overhung with ilex and dark box-woods looking
west they could see below them in a haze of light lowlands and broad meads
and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramir "i hope you
will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not
to slay you or to bind you but it is a command that no stranger not even one
of rohan that fights with us shall see the path we now go with open eyes i
must blindfold you
as you will said frodo even the elves do likewise at need and
blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair lothlórien gimli the dwarf
took it ill but the hobbits endured it
it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you said faramir but i am
glad that you will take this willingly and not by force
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped out of the trees
and came back to him blindfold these guests said faramir securely but not
so as to discomfort them do not tie their hands they will give their word not
to try and see i could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord but
eyes will blink if the feet stumble lead them so that they do not falter
with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits eyes and drew
their hoods down almost to their mouths then quickly they took each one by the
hand and went on their way all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile of the
road they learned from guessing in the dark after a little they found that they
were on a path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they went in
single file brushing a stony wall on either side their guards steered them
from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders now and again they came
to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while and then set down
again always the noise of the running water was on their right hand and it
grew nearer and louder at length they were halted quickly mablung and damrod
turned them about several times and they lost all sense of direction they
climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become
faint then they were picked up and carried down down many steps and round a
corner suddenly they heard the water again loud now rushing and splashing
all round them it seemed and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks
at last they were set on their feet once more for a moment they stood so half
fearful blindfold not knowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind let them see  he said the
scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the doorstep as it were of a
rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them but in front a thin veil of
water was hung so near that frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it
it faced westward the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it and
the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever-changing colour it
was as if they stood at the window of some elven-tower curtained with threaded
jewels of silver and gold and ruby sapphire and amethyst all kindled with an
unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for your
patience said faramir this is the window of the sunset henneth annûn
fairest of all the falls of ithilien land of many fountains few strangers have
ever seen it but there is no kingly hall behind to match it enter now
and see 
even as he spoke the sun sank and the fire faded in the flowing water they
turned and passed under the low forbidding arch at once they found themselves
in a rock-chamber wide and rough with an uneven stooping roof a few torches
were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls many men were already
there others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door
on one side as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the
cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms
and victuals
well here is our refuge said faramir not a place of great ease but here
you may pass the night in peace it is dry at least and there is food though
no fire at one time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the
arch but its course was changed further up the gorge by workmen of old and
the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above all
the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught
else all save one there are now but two ways out: that passage yonder by which
you entered blindfold and through the window-curtain into a deep bowl filled
with knives of stone now rest a while until the evening meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on if they
wished meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly
quickness light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and
laden with gear this was plain and unadorned for the most part but all well
and fairly made: round platters bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or
turned box-wood smooth and clean here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by the captains seat in the middle
of the inmost table
faramir went about among the men questioning each as he came in in a soft
voice some came back from the pursuit of the southrons others left behind
as scouts near the road came in latest all the southrons had been accounted
for save only the great mûmak: what happened to him none could say of
the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc-spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man no orc at least but i saw or thought i
saw something a little strange it was getting deep dusk when the eyes make
things greater than they should be so perhaps it may have been no more than a
squirrel sam pricked up his ears at this yet if so it was a black squirrel
and i saw no tail twas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked behind a
tree-trunk when i drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose and it seemed no more so
i tried no arrow it was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the creature was
gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling but i stayed for a while for
it seemed strange and then i hastened back i thought i heard the thing hiss at
me from high above as i turned away a large squirrel maybe perhaps under the
shadow of the unnamed some of the beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our
woods they have black squirrels there tis said
perhaps said faramir but that would be an ill omen if it were so we do
not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien sam fancied that he gave a swift
glance towards the hobbits as he spoke but sam said nothing for a while he and
frodo lay back and watched the torchlight and the men moving to and fro
speaking in hushed voices then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that he may be all right
he thought and then he may not fair speech may hide a foul heart he yawned
i could sleep for a week and id be better for it and what can i do if i do
keep awake me all alone and all these great men about nothing sam gamgee
but youve got to keep awake all the same and somehow he managed it the light
faded from the cave door and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and was
lost in gathering shadow always the sound of the water went on never changing
its note morning or evening or night it murmured and whispered of sleep sam
stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit a cask of wine was broached storage barrels
were being opened men were fetching water from the fall some were laving their
hands in basins a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to faramir
and he washed
wake our guests he said and take them water it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched sam not used to being waited on
looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed holding a basin of water
before him
put it on the ground master if you please  he said easier for me and
you then to the astonishment and amusement of the men he plunged his head into
the cold water and splashed his neck and ears
is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper  said the man
who waited on the hobbits
no before breakfast said sam but if youre short of sleep cold water on
the necks like rain on a wilted lettuce there now i can keep awake long
enough to eat a bit
they were led then to seats beside faramir: barrels covered with pelts and
high enough above the benches of the men for their convenience before they ate
faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence faramir
signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise
so we always do he said as they sat down: we look towards númenor
that was and beyond to elvenhome that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome
and will ever be have you no such custom at meat 
no said frodo feeling strangely rustic and untutored but if we are
guests we bow to our host and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent ¤n the lonely wild the
evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine cool and
fragrant and eat bread and butter and salted meats and dried fruits and good
red cheese with clean hands and clean knives and plates neither frodo nor sam
refused anything that was offered nor a second nor
indeed a third helping the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land
of lórien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave
partly screened by curtains and a chair and two stools were brought there a
little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially good samwise who
would not close his eyes before he ate - whether for fear of blunting the edge
of a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not know but it is not good to sleep
too soon after meat and that following a fast let us talk a while on your
journey from rivendell there must have been many things to tell and you too
would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the
lands where you now are tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lothlórien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk but though the food
and wine had put him at his ease he had not lost all his caution sam was
beaming and humming to himself but when frodo spoke he was at first content to
listen only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
frodo told many tales yet always he steered the matter away from the quest
of the company and from the ring enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir
had played in all their adventures with the wolves of the wild in the snows
under caradhras and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell faramir was most
moved by the story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir to run from orcs he said or even from the
fell thing you name the balrog - even though he was the last to leave
he was the last said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us he alone
knew the way after gandalfs fall but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir
said faramir and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of
rauros
maybe but tell me now of your own fortunes said frodo turning the matter
aside once again for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath and
minas tirith the long-enduring what hope have you for that city in your long
war 
what hope have we  said faramir it is long since we had any hope the
sword of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle it but i do not think that
it will do more than put off the evil day unless other help unlooked-for also
comes from elves or men for the enemy increases and we decrease we are a
failing people a springless autumn
the men of númenor were settled far and wide on the shores and
seaward regions of the great lands but for the most part they fell into
evils and follies many became enamoured of the darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and some fought among
themselves until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised in gondor or that the
nameless one was ever named in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty
brought out of the west remained long in the realm of the sons of elendil the
fair and they linger there still yet even so it was gondor that brought about
its own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that the enemy was
asleep who was only banished not destroyed
death was ever present because the númenoreans still as they had in
their old kingdom and so lost it hungered after endless life
unchanging kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living and
counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in secret
chambers withered men compounded strong elixirs or in high cold towers asked
questions of the stars and the last king of the line of anárion had no
heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate wiser for they recruited
the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea-coast and from the
hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais and they made a truce with the proud peoples
of the north who often had assailed us men of fierce valour but our kin from
afar off unlike the wild easterlings or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cirion the twelfth steward and my father
is the sit and twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the great field of
celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them masters of horses and we ceded to them
the fields of calenardhon that are since called rohan for that province had
long been sparsely peopled and they became our allies and have ever proved
true to us aiding us at need and guarding our northern marches and the gap of
rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they would and their lords
speak our speech at need yet for the most part they hold by the ways of their
own fathers and to their own memories and they speak among themselves their own
north tongue and we love them: tall men and fair women valiant both alike
golden-haired bright-eyed and strong they remind us of the youth of men as
they were in the elder days indeed it is said by our lore-masters
that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those
same three houses of men as were the númenoreans in their beginning not
from hador the goldenhaired the elf-friend maybe yet from such of his sons
and people as went not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore calling them the high or men of the west
which were númenoreans and the middle peoples men of the twilight such
as are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the north and
the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us enhanced in
arts and gentleness we too have become more like to them and can scarce claim
any longer the title high we are become middle men of the twilight but with
memory of other things for as the rohirrim do we now love war and valour as
things good in themselves both a sport and an end and though we still hold
that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of
weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other
crafts such is the need of our days so even was my brother boromir: a man of
prowess and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor and very valiant
indeed he was: no heir of minas tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn faramir
sighed and fell silent for a while
you dont say much in all your tales about the elves sir said sam
suddenly plucking up courage he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and his food and wine had
won sams respect and quieted his suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not
learned in elven-lore but there you touch upon another point in which we have
changed declining from númenor to middle-earth for as you may know if
mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken with elrond the edain the
fathers of the númenoreans fought beside the elves in the first
wars and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the sea
within sight of elvenhome but in middle-earth men and elves became estranged in
the days of darkness by the arts of the enemy and by the slow changes of time
in which each kind walked further down their sundered roads men now fear and
misdoubt the elves and yet know little of them and we of gondor grow like
other men like the men of rohan for even they who are the foes of the dark
lord shun the elves and speak of the golden wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the elves when they
may and ever and anon one will go in secret to lórien seldom to return
not i for i deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the
elder people yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lórien galadriel cried sam you should see her indeed
you should sir i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at home sir if you
understand me and im not much good at poetry - not at making it: a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and again you know but not real poetry - so i
cant tell you what i mean it ought to be sung youd have to get strider
aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for that but i wish i could make a song
about her beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tree in flower
sometimes like a white daffadowndilly small and slender like hard as dimonds
soft as moonlight warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars proud and
far-off as a snow-mountain and as merry as any lass i ever saw with daisies in
her hair in springtime but thats a lot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir perilously fair
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into lórien and
finds it there because theyve brought it but perhaps you could call her
perilous because shes so strong in herself you you could dash yourself to pieces
on her like a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river but
neither rock nor river would be to blame now boro -  he stopped and went red
in the face
yes now boromir you would say  said faramir what would you say
he took his peril with him 
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as your brother was if i may
say so but youve been warm on the scent all along now i watched boromir and
listened to him from rivendell all down the road - looking after my master as
youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromir - and its my opinion
that in lórien he first saw clearly what i guessed sooner: what he
wanted from the moment he first saw it he wanted the enemys ring 
sam  cried frodo aghast he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me  said sam turning white and then flushing scarlet there i go
again when ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer
used to say to me and right enough o dear o dear
now look here sir  he turned facing up to faramir with all the courage
that he could muster dont you go taking advantage of my master because his
servants no better than a fool youve spoken very handsome all along put me
off my guard talking of elves and all but handsome is as handsome does
we say nows a chance to show your quality
so it seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddles the one ring that was thought to have
perished from the world and boromir tried to take it by force and you escaped
and ran all the way - to me and here in the wild i have you: two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings a pretty stroke of fortune a
chance for faramir captain of gondor to show his quality ha he stood up
very tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with
their backs to the wall fumbling for their sword-hilts there was a silence
all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder but
faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly and then
suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial  he said how you have
increased my sorrow you two strange wanderers from a far country bearing the
peril of men but you are less judges of men than i of halflings we are
truth-speakers we men of gondor we boast seldom and then perform or die in
the attempt not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man as to desire this thing and even though i knew not
clearly what this thing was when i spoke still i should take those words as a
vow and be held by them
but i am not such a man or i am wise enough to know that there are some
perils from which a man must flee sit at peace and be comforted samwise if
you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so your heart is
shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes for strange though
it may seem it was safe to declare this to me it may even help the master that
you love it shall turn to his good if it is in my power so be comforted but
do not even name this thing again aloud once is enough
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet men turned back to
their drink and their talk perceiving that their captain had had some jest or
other with the little guests and that it was over
well frodo now at last we understand one another said faramir if you
took this thing on yourself unwilling at others asking then you have pity
and honour from me and i marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use it you
are a new people and a new world to me are all your kin of like sort your land
must be a realm of peace and content and there must gardeners be in high
honour
not all is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grow weary there even in their gardens as do all things
under the sun of this world and you are far from home and wayworn no more
tonight sleep both of you - in peace if you can fear not i do not wish to
see it or touch it or know more of it than i know which is enough lest
peril perchance waylay me and i fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest - but first tell me only if you will whither you wish to go
and what to do for i must watch and wait and think time passes in the
morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed now a
great weariness came down on him like a cloud he could dissemble and resist no
longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faintly i was going to
gorgoroth i must find the mountain of fire and cast the thing into the gulf of
doom gandalf said so i do not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment then suddenly he
caught him as he swayed and lifting him gently carried him to the bed and laid
him there and covered him warmly at once he fell into a deep sleep
another bed was set beside him for his servant sam hesitated for a moment
then bowing very low: good night captain my lord he said you took the
chance sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality: the very highest
faramir smiled a pert servant master samwise but nay: the praise of the
praiseworthy is above all rewards yet there was naught in this to praise i had
no lure or desire to do other than i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master had an elvish air and that was
good and true but i can say this: you have an air too sir that reminds me of
of - well gandalf of wizards
maybe said faramir maybe you discern from
far away the air of númenor good night
 
frodo woke to find faramir bending over him for a second old fears seized
him and he sat up and shrank away
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is it morning already  said frodo yawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and the full moon is setting will
you come and see it also there is a matter on which i desire your counsel i am
sorry to rouse you from sleep but will you come 
i will said frodo rising and shivering a little as he left the warm
blanket and pelts it seemed cold in the fireless cave the noise of the water
was loud in the stillness he put on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness saw first his masters
empty bed and leapt to his feet then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale white light he
hurried after them past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall as
he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the curtain was now become a dazzling veil
of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight but he did
not pause to admire it and turning aside he followed his master through the
narrow doorway in the wall of the cave
they went first along a black passage then up many wet steps and so came to
a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky gleaming high
above through a long deep shaft from here two flights of steps led: one going
on as it seemed up on to the high bank of the stream the other turning away
to the left this they followed it wound its way up like a turret-stair
at last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about they were on a
wide flat rock without rail or parapet at their right eastwards the torrent
fell splashing over many terraces and then pouring down a steep race it
filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam and
curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that
yawned upon their left a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away the world was quiet and cold as if
dawn were near far off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf of silver fume
beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the anduin a black darkness
loomed beyond and in it glinted here and there cold sharp remote white as
the teeth of ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of the realm
of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone and a shiver ran through
him wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night-lands his old companions
walked or slept or lay dead shrouded in mist why was he brought here out of
forgetful sleep
sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain
himself from muttering for his masters ear alone as he thought: its a fine
view no doubt mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mention the bones
whats going on 
faramir heard and answered moonset over gondor fair ithil as he goes from
middle-earth glances upon the white locks of old mindolluin it is worth a few
shivers but that is not what i brought you to see-though as for you samwise
you were not brought and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness a draught
of wine shall amend it come look now 
he stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge and frodo
followed sam hung back he already felt insecure enough on this high wet
platform faramir and frodo looked down far below them they saw the white
waters pour into a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin
in the rocks until they found their way out again through a narrow gate and
flowed away fuming and chattering into calmer and more level reaches the
moonlight still slanted down to the falls foot and gleamed on the ripples of
the basin presently frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank but
even as he looked at it it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble
of the fall cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise
stone
faramir turned to the man at his side now what would you say that it is
anborn a squirrel or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers in the
night-pools of mirkwood 
tis not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn it has four limbs
and dives manwise a pretty mastery of the craft it shows too what is it at
seeking a way up behind the curtain to our hidings it seems we are discovered
at last i have my bow here and i have posted other archers nigh as good
marksmen as myself on either bank we wait only for your command to shoot
captain
shall we shoot  said faramir turning quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer for a moment then no  he said no i beg you not
to if sam had dared he would have said yes quicker and louder he could
not see but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at
you know then what this thing is  said faramir come now you have
seen tell me why it should be spared in all our words together you have not
once spoken of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time he could
wait till he was caught and brought before me i sent my keenest huntsmen to
seek him but he slipped them and they had no sight of him till now save
anborn here once at dusk yesterevening but now he has done worse trespass than
only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has dared to come to henneth annûn
and his life is forfeit i marvel at the creature: so secret and so sly as he
is to come sporting in the pool before our very window does he think
that men sleep without watch all night why does he so
there are two answers i think said frodo for one thing he knows little
of men and sly though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not
know that men are concealed here for another i think he is allured here by a
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say  said faramir in a low voice can he does he
then know of your burden 
indeed yes he bore it himself for many years
he bore it  said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder this
matter winds itself ever in new riddles then he is pursuing it 
maybe it is precious to him but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek 
fish said frodo look 
they peered down at the dark pool a little black head appeared at the far
end of the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks there was a brief
silver glint and a swirl of tiny ripples it swam to the side and then with
marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered
as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall
at the pools end
faramir laughed softly fish  he said it is a less perilous hunger or
maybe not: fish from the pool of henneth annûn may cost him all he has to
give
now i have him at the arrow-point said anborn shall i not shoot
captain for coming unbidden to this place death is our law
wait anborn said faramir this is a harder matter than it seems what
have you to say now frodo why should we spare 
the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his
danger and gandalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you not to slay him
for that reason and for others he forbade the elves to do so i do not know
clearly why and of what i guess i cannot speak openly out here but this
creature is in some way bound up with my errand until you found us and took us
he was my guide
your guide  said faramir the matter becomes ever stranger i would do
much for you frodo but this i cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free
at his own will from here to join you later if it please him or to be caught
by orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly but how can this slippery thing of many
guises be caught save by a feathered shaft 
let me go down quietly to him said frodo you may keep your bows bent
and shoot me at least if i fail i shall not run away
go then and be swift  said faramir if he comes off alive he should be
your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days lead frodo down to the
bank anborn and go softly the thing has a nose and ears give me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing and
then up the other stair until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded
with thick bushes passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western sky he could not
see gollum he went forward a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on  he breathed in frodos ear have a care to your right if you fall
in the pool then no one but your fishing friend can help you and forget not
that there are bowmen near at hand though you may not see them
frodo crept forward using his hands gollum-like to feel his way and to
steady himself the rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery
he halted listening at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing rush of
the fall behind him then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
fissh nice fissh white face has vanished my precious at last yes now
we can eat fish in peace no not in peace precious for precious is lost yes
lost dirty hobbits nasty hobbits gone and left us gollum
and precious is gone only poor sméagol all alone no precious nasty
men theyll take it steal my precious thieves we hates them fissh
nice fissh: makes us strong makes eyes bright fingers tight yes throttle
them precious throttle them all yes if we gets chances nice fissh nice
fissh 
so it went on almost as unceasing as the waterfall only interrupted by a
faint noise of slavering and gurgling frodo shivered listening with pity and
disgust he wished it would stop and that he never need hear that voice again
anborn was not far behind he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen
to shoot they would probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off
his guard only one true shot and frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for
ever but no gollum had a claim on him now the servant has a claim on the
master for service even service in fear they would have foundered in the dead
marshes but for gollum frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf
would not have wished it
sméagol  he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the voice
sméagol  he said a little louder the voice stopped
sméagol master has come to look for you master is here come sméagol
 there was no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
come sméagol  said frodo we are in danger men will kill you if
they find you here come quickly if you wish to escape death come to master
no said the voice not nice master leaves poor sméagol
and goes with new friends master can wait sméagol hasnt finished
theres no time said frodo bring fish with you come 
no must finish fish
sméagol  said frodo desperately precious will be angry i shall
take precious and i shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke
never taste fish again come precious is waiting 
there was a sharp hiss presently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on
all fours like an erring dog called to heel he had a half-eaten fish in his
mouth and another in his hand he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and
sniffed at him his pale eyes were shining then he took the fish out of his
mouth and stood up
nice master  he whispered nice hobbit come back to poor sméagol
good sméagol comes now lets go go quickly yes through the
trees while the faces are dark yes come lets go 
yes well go soon said frodo but not at once i will go with you as i
promised i promise again but not now you are not safe yet i will save you
but you must trust me
we must trust master  said gollum doubtfully why why not go at once
where is the other one the cross rude hobbit where is he
away up there said frodo pointing to the waterfall i am not going
without him we must go back to him his heart sank this was too much like
trickery he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum to be killed
but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him and certainly what frodo
did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature it would probably
be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that frodo had saved his
life in the only way he could what else could he do - to keep faith as near
as might be with both sides come he said or the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the stream go on go on you go in front 
gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way snuffling and
suspicious presently he stopped and raised his head somethings there  he
said not a hobbit suddenly he turned back a green light was flickering in
his bulging eyes masster masster he hissed wicked tricksy false he
spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed up behind him and came
down on him a large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and pinned
him he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as he was wriggling
like an eel biting and scratching like a cat but two more men came up out of
the shadows
hold still  said one or well stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still
gollum went limp and began to whine and weep they tied him none too
gently
easy easy  said frodo he has no strength to match you dont
hurt him if you can help it hell be quieter if you dont sméagol
they wont hurt you ill go with you and you shall come to no harm not unless
they kill me too trust master 
gollum turned and spat at him the men picked him up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wretched they went through the opening
behind the bushes and back down the stairs and passages into the cave two or
three torches had been lit men were stirring sam was there and he gave a
queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried got him he said to frodo
yes well no i didnt get him he came to me because he trusted me at
first im afraid i did not want him tied up like this i hope it will be all
right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of
misery is
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits and took them to the recess at the
back of the cave faramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp had been
rekindled in its niche above his head he signed to them to sit down on the
stools beside him bring wine for the guests he said and bring the prisoner
to me
the wine was brought and then anborn came carrying gollum he removed the
cover from gollums head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support
him gollum blinked hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserable creature he looked dripping and dank smelling of fish he
still clutched one in his hand his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed
over his bony brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us  he said the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us
and weve done nothing
nothing  said faramir looking at the wretched creature with a keen
glance but without any expression in his face either of anger or pity or
wonder nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse
punishment however that is not for me to judge happily but tonight you have
come where it is death to come the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir only to come here and look
on the pool bears the penalty of death i have spared you so far at the prayer
of frodo here who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks but
you must also satisfy me what is your name whence do you come and whither do
you go what is your business 
we are lost lost said gollum no name no business no precious
nothing only empty only hungry yes we are hungry a few little fishes nasty
bony little fishes for a poor creature and they say death so wise they are
so just so very just
not very wise said faramir but just: yes perhaps as just as our little
wisdom allows unloose him frodo  faramir took a small nail-knife from his
belt and handed it to frodo gollum misunderstanding the gesture squealed and
fell down
now sméagol  said frodo you must trust me i will not
desert you answer truthfully if you can it will do you good not harm he cut
the cords on gollums wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet
come hither  said faramir look at me do you know the name of this
place have you been here before 
slowly gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into faramirs all
light went out of them and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into the
clear unwavering eyes of the man of gondor there was a still silence then
gollum dropped his head and shrank down until he was squatting on the floor
shivering we doesnt know and we doesnt want to know he whimpered never
came here never come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind and dark rooms
behind them said faramir but in this i judge that you speak the truth it is
well for you what oath will you swear never to return and never to lead any
living creature hither by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong glance at frodo yes
he knows we will promise master if he saves us well promise to it yes he
crawled to frodos feet save us nice master  he whined sméagol
promises to precious promises faithfully never come again never speak no
never no precious no
are you satisfied  said faramir
yes said frodo at least you must either accept this promise or carry
out your law you will get no more but i promised that if he came to me he
should not be harmed and i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought very good he said at last i
surrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo let him declare what he
will do with you 
but lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared your will
concerning the said frodo and until that is made known he cannot shape his
plans for himself or his companions your judgement was postponed until the
morning but that is now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir as for you frodo in so far as
lies in me under higher authority i declare you free in the realm of gondor to
the furthest of its ancient bounds save only that neither you nor any that go
with you have leave to come to this place unbidden this doom shall stand for a
year and a day and then cease unless you shall before that term come to minas
tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the city then i will
entreat him to confirm what i have done and to make it lifelong in the
meantime whomsoever you take under your protection shall be under my protection
and under the shield of gondor are you answered 
frodo bowed low i am answered he said and i place myself at your
service if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable
it is of great worth said faramir and now
do you take this creature this sméagol under your protection 
i do take sméagol under my protection said frodo sam sighed
audibly and not at the courtesies of which as any hobbit would he thoroughly
approved indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a great
many more words and bows
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum you are under doom of
death but while you walk with frodo you are safe for our part yet if ever you
be found by any man of gondor astray without him the doom shall fall and may
death find you swiftly within gondor or without if you do not well serve him
now answer me: whither would you go you were his guide he says whither were
you leading him  gollum made no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir answer me or i will reverse my
judgement  still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frodo he brought me to the black gate as i
asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land said faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the southward road  frodo
continued for he said that there is or there may be a path near to minas
ithil
minas morgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path climbs i think up into
the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city stands it
goes up to a high cleft and so down to - that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass  said faramir
no said frodo
it is called cirith ungol gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to
himself is not that its name  said faramir turning to him
no  said gollum and then he squealed as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the name once but what does the name matter to us master
says he must get in so we must try some way there is no other way to try no
no other way  said faramir how do you know that and who has explored
all the confines of that dark realm  he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
presently he spoke again take this creature away anborn treat him gently
but watch him and do not you sméagol try to dive into the falls the
rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time leave us now and
take your fish 
anborn went out and gollum went cringing before him the curtain was drawn
across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir i do not think
you should go with this creature it is wicked
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it like a canker and
the evil is growing he will lead you to no good if you will part with him i
will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of gondor
that he may name
he would not take it said frodo he would follow after me as he long has
done and i have promised many times to take him under my protection and to go
where he led you would not ask me to break faith with him
no said faramir but my heart would for it seems less evil to counsel
another man to break troth than to do so oneself especially if one sees a
friend bound unwitting to his own harm but no - if he will go with you you
must now endure him but i do not think you are holden to go to cirith ungol of
which he has told you less than he knows that much i perceived clearly in his
mind do not go to cirith ungol
where then shall i go  said frodo back to the black gate and deliver
myself up to the guard what do you know against this place that makes its name
so dreadful 
nothing certain said faramir we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men has ever done so nor has any of
us set foot upon the mountains of shadow of them we know only old report and
the rumour of bygone days but there is some dark terror that dwells in the
passes above minas morgul if cirith ungol is named old men and masters of lore
will blanch and fall silent
the valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long ago and it was a
menace and a dread while the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our keeping as you know that city was once a strong
place proud and fair minas ithil the twin sister of our own city but it was
taken by fell men whom the enemy in his first strength had dominated and who
wandered homeless and masterless after his fall it is said that their lords
were men of númenor who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the
enemy had given rings of power and he had devoured them: living ghosts
they were become terrible and evil after his going they took minas ithil and
dwelt there and they filled it and all the valley about with decay: it seemed
empty and was not so for a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls nine
lords there were and after the return of their master which they aided and
prepared in secret they grew strong again then the nine riders issued forth
from the gates of horror and we could not withstand them do not approach their
citadel you will be espied it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless
eyes do not go that way 
but where else will you direct me  said frodo you cannot yourself you
say guide me to the mountains nor over them but over the mountains i am
bound by solemn undertaking to the council to find a way or perish in the
seeking and if i turn back refusing the road in its bitter end where then
shall i go among elves or men would you have me come to gondor with this thing
the thing that drove your brother mad with desire what spell would it work in
minas tirith shall there be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filled with rottenness 
i would not have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do 
i know not only i would not have you go to death or to torment and i do
not think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such paths as i can find and there is no
time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said
faramir but at the least remember my warning: beware of this guide sméagol
he has done murder before now i read it in him he sighed
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogo you have no need of soft
words: i do not hope to see you again on any other day under this sun but you
shall go now with my blessing upon you and upon all your people rest a little
while food is prepared for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping sméagol became possessed
of the thing of which we speak and how he lost it but i will not trouble you
now if ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our
tales sitting by a wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me
then until that time or some other time beyond
the vision of the seeing-stones of númenor farewell 
he rose and bowed low to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the
cave
 
frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a
little while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began after
a while water was brought to them and then they were led to a table where food
was set for three faramir broke his fast with them he had not slept since the
battle on the day before yet he did not look weary
when they had finished they stood up may no hunger trouble you on the
road said faramir you have little provision but some small store of food
fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs you will have no
lack of water as you walk in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that flows
from imlad morgul the valley of living death this also i must tell you my
scouts and watchers have all returned even some that have crept within sight of
the morannon they all find a strange thing the land is empty nothing is on
the road and no sound of foot or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard a
waiting silence broods above the nameless land i do not know what this
portends but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion storm is coming
hasten while you may if you are ready let us go the sun will soon rise above
the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little heavier than they had
been and also two stout staves of polished wood shod with iron and with
carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting said faramir but take
these staves they may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild the
men of the white mountains use them though these have been cut down to your
height and newly shod they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved
of the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and
returning may that virtue not wholly fail under the shadow into which you go
the hobbits bowed low most gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon the way secret and
unlooked for certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown to
have found it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart gollum was brought out of some corner or
hiding-hole and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been though
he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir
your guide must be blindfolded said faramir but you and your servant
samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clutched at frodo when they came to bind
his eyes and frodo said: blindfold us all three
and cover up my eyes first and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant
this was done and they were led from the cave of henneth annûn after
they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air
fresh and sweet about them still blind they went on for some little time up
and then gently down at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of the woods again no noise of the falls could
be heard for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in
which the stream flowed to the west they could see light through the trees as
if the world came there to a sudden end at a brink looking out only on to sky
here is the last parting of our ways said faramir if you take my
counsel you will not turn eastward yet go straight on for thus you will have
the cover of the woodland for many miles on your west is an edge where the land
falls into the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long
hillsides keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest in the beginning
of your journey you may walk under daylight i think the land dreams in a false
peace and for a while all evil is withdrawn fare you well while you may
he embraced the hobbits then after the manner of his people stooping and
placing his hands upon their shoulders and kissing their foreheads go with
the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground then he turned and without looking back he left
them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away they
marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved vanishing
almost in the twinkling of an eye the forest where faramir had stood seemed
empty and drear as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back southward as if to mark his disregard of all
such courtesy gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree hungry
again already thought sam well now for it again
have they gone at last  said gollum nassty
wicked men sméagols neck still hurts him yes it does lets go 
yes let us go said frodo but if you can only speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silent 
nice master  said gollum sméagol was only joking always
forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice sméagol 
frodo and sam did not answer hoisting their packs and taking their staves in
hand they passed on into the woods of ithilien
twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by faramir:
dried fruits and salted meat enough for many days and bread enough to last
while it was still fresh gollum ate nothing
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to sink and the light
through the trees to the west grew golden and always they walked in cool green
shadow and all about them was silence the birds seemed all to have flown away
or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to the silent woods and before the fall of night they
halted weary for they had walked seven leagues or more from henneth annûn
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times but there was never a sign
of gollum who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby or had wandered restlessly
prowling through the night he did not say but he returned with the first
glimmer of light and roused his companions
must get up yes they must he said long ways to go still south and
east hobbits must make haste
that day passed much as the day before had gone except that the silence
seemed deeper the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewing gollum often paused sniffing the air and
then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on and afternoon waned the
forest opened out and the trees became larger and more scattered great ilexes
of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among
them hoary ash-trees and giant oaks just putting out their brown-green buds
about them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones
white and blue now folded for sleep and there were acres populous with the
leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were thrusting
through the mould no living creature beast or bird was to be seen but in
these open places gollum grew afraid and they walked now with caution flitting
from one long shadow to another
light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end there they sat under
an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep
crumbling bank a deep dim valley lay before them on its further side the woods
gathered again blue and grey under the sullen evening and marched on
southwards to the right the mountains of gondor glowed remote in the west
under a fire-flecked sky to the left lay darkness: the towering walls of
mordor and out of that darkness the long valley came falling steeply in an
ever-widening trough towards the anduin at its bottom ran a hurrying stream:
frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through the silence and beside it on
the hither side a road went winding down like a pale ribbon down into chill
grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched there it seemed to frodo that he
descried far off floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high dim tops and
broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark
he turned to gollum do you know where we are  he said
yes master dangerous places this is the road from the tower of the moon
master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river the ruined city
yes very nasty place full of enemies we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have come a long way out of the path must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains and we cant use this
road oh no cruel peoples come this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in the mist but
there was an evil feeling in the air as if things might indeed be passing up
and down that eyes could not see frodo shuddered as he looked again at the
distant pinnacles now dwindling into night and the sound of the water seemed
cold and cruel: the voice of morgulduin the polluted stream that flowed from
the valley of the wraiths
what shall we do  he said we have walked long and far shall we look for
some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden 
no good hiding in the dark said gollum its in day that hobbits must
hide now yes in day
oh come  said sam we must rest for a bit even if we get up again in the
middle of the night therell still be hours of dark then time enough for you to
take us a long march if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back towards the trees
working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood he would
not rest on the ground so near the evil road and after some debate they all
climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak whose thick branches springing
together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable
refuge night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit but
gollum at once curled up and went to sleep the hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum woke up: suddenly they
were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them he listened and sniffed
which seemed as they had noticed before his usual method of discovering the
time of night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said lets go
we arent and we havent growled sam but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours and the
hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again with gollum leading eastwards
up the dark sloping land they could see little for the night was now so deep
that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against
them the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult but gollum
seemed in no way troubled he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles
sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit sometimes down into black
bush-shrouded hollows and out again but if ever they went a little downward
always the further slope was longer and steeper they were climbing steadily at
their first halt they looked back and they could dimly perceive the roofs of
the forest they had left behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blank sky there seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly
out of the east eating up the faint blurred stars later the sinking moon
escaped from the pursuing cloud but it was ringed all about with a sickly
yellow glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbits day soon he said hobbits must
hurry not safe to stay in the open in these places make haste 
he quickened his pace and they followed him wearily soon they began to
climb up on to a great hog-back of land for the most part it was covered with a
thick growth of gorse and whortleberry and low tough thorns though here and
there clearings opened the scars of recent fires the gorse-bushes became more
frequent as they got nearer the top very old and tall they were gaunt and
leggy below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowers that
glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent so tall were the spiny
thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them passing through long
dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and
crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns their twisted boughs
stooping to the ground were overridden by a clambering maze of old briars deep
inside there was a hollow hall raftered with dead branch and bramble and
roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring there they lay for a while
too tired yet to eat and peering out through the holes in the covert they
watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight in the east there was a dull red
glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of dawn across the tumbled
lands between the mountains of the ephel dúath
frowned at them black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not
pass away above with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against
the fiery glow away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out
dark and black amid the shadows thrusting westward
which way do we go from here asked frodo is that the opening of-of the
morgul valley away over there beyond that black mass
need we think about it yet said sam surely were not going to move any
more today if day it is
perhaps not perhaps not said gollum but we must go soon to the
cross-roads yes to the cross-roads thats the way over there yes master
the red glare over mordor died away the twilight deepened as great vapours
rose in the east and crawled above them frodo and sam took a little food and
then lay down but gollum was restless he would not eat any of their food but
he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes sniffing and
muttering then suddenly he disappeared
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned it was his turn to sleep
first and he was soon deep in a dream he thought he was back in the bag end
garden looking for something but he had a heavy pack on his back which made
him stoop it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow and thorns and bracken
were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i can see but im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for my pipe he said and with
that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opened his eyes and wondered why he was
lying down under the hedge its in your pack all the time then he realized
first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf and next that he
was hundreds of miles from bag end he sat up it seemed to be almost dark why
had his master let him sleep on out of turn right on till evening
havent you had no sleep mr frodo he said whats the time seems to be
getting late
no it isnt said frodo but the day is getting darker instead of lighter:
darker and darker as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet and youve only
slept for about three hours
i wonder whats up said sam is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst there ever was we shall wish we were down a deep hole not just
stuck under a hedge he listened whats that thunder or drums or what is
it 
i dont know said frodo its been going on for a good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to be the heavy air
throbbing in your ears
sam looked round wheres gollum  he said hasnt he come back yet
no said frodo theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam in fact ive never taken anything on a
journey that id have been less sorry to lose on the way but it would be just
like him after coming all these miles to go and get lost now just when we
shall need him most - that is if hes ever going to be any use which i doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo i hope nothing has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into
other hands as you might say because if he does we shall soon be in for
trouble
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again louder now and
deeper the ground seemed to quiver under their feet i think we are in for
trouble anyhow said frodo im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hope as my gaffer
used to say and need of vittles as he mostways used to add you have a
bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed it must be called wore on looking out from
the covert he could see only a dun shadowless world fading slowly into a
featureless colourless gloom it felt stifling but not warm frodo slept
unquietly turning and tossing and sometimes murmuring twice sam thought he
heard him speaking gandalfs name the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was gollum on all fours peering
at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered wake up no time to
lose we must go yes we must go at once no time to lose
sam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited go now
whats your little game it isnt time yet it cant be tea-time even leastways
not in decent places where there is tea-time
silly  hissed gollum were not in decent places times running short
yes running fast no time to lose we must go wake up master wake u he
clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of sleep sat up suddenly and seized
him by the arm gollum tore himself loose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed we must go no time to lose and
nothing more could they get out of him where he had been and what he thought
was brewing to make him in such a hurry he would not say sam was filled with
deep suspicion and showed it but frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his
mind he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the
ever-gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under cover
wherever it was possible and running almost bent to the ground across any
open space but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild
could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their grey cloaks nor heard
them walking as warily as the little people can without the crack of a twig or
the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went on silently in single file oppressed by the
gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land broken only now and again by
the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the
hills down from their hiding-place they went and then turning south they
steered as straight a course as gollum could find across a long broken slope
that leaned up towards the mountains presently not far ahead looming up like
a black wall they saw a belt of trees as they drew nearer they became aware
that these were of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering high
though their tops were gaunt and broken as if tempest and lightning-blast had
swept across them but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless
roots
the cross-roads yes whispered gollum the first words that had been
spoken since they left their hiding-place we must go that way turning
eastward now he led them up the slope and then suddenly there it was before
them: the southward road winding its way about the outer feet of the mountains
until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum no paths beyond the road no
paths we must go to the cross-roads but make haste be silent 
as furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies they crept down
on to the road and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank grey as
the stones themselves and soft-footed as hunting cats at length they reached
the trees and found that they stood in a great roofless ring open in the
middle to the sombre sky and the spaces between their immense boles were like
the great dark arches of some ruined hall in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morannon before them it ran out again upon its
long journey south to their right the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness: the fourth way the road they
were to take
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo became aware that a light
was shining he saw it glowing on sams face beside him turning towards it he
saw beyond an arch of boughs the road to osgiliath running almost as straight
as a stretched ribbon down down into the west there far away beyond sad
gondor now overwhelmed in shade the sun was sinking finding at last the hem of
the great slow-rolling pall of cloud and falling in an ominous fire towards the
yet unsullied sea the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still and
solemn as the great stone kings of argonath the years had gnawed it and
violent hands had maimed it its head was gone and in its place was set in
mockery a round rough-hewn stone rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness
of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead upon its
knees and mighty chair and all about the pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with
the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old kings head: it was
lying rolled away by the roadside look sam he cried startled into speech
look the king has got a crown again
the eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken but about the high
stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold a trailing plant with
flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in
reverence for the fallen king and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow
stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo and then suddenly the brief
glimpse was gone the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the shuttering of a
lamp black night fell
 
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissing with fear and impatience we
must go he said we mustnt stand here make haste
reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west and followed as his guide led
him out into the darkness of the east they left the ring of trees and crept
along the road towards the mountains this road too ran straight for a while
but soon it began to bend away southwards until it came right under the great
shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance black and forbidding it
loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind crawling under its shadow
the road went on and rounding it sprang east again and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no longer able to care
greatly about their peril frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging him
down again as soon as the great cross-roads had been passed the weight of it
almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more now feeling the way
become steep before his feet he looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said that he would: the city of the ringwraiths he cowered against
the stony bank
a long-tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far into the mountains
upon the further side some way within the valleys arms high on a rocky seat
upon the black knees of the ephel dúath
stood the walls and tower of minas morgul all was dark about it earth and sky
but it was lit with light not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the
marble walls of minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and radiant
in the hollow of the hills paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow
eclipse was the light of it now wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation
of decay a corpse-light a light that illuminated nothing in the walls and
tower windows showed like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness
but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly first one way and then
another a huge ghostly head leering into the night for a moment the three
companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes gollum was
the first to recover again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no
word almost he dragged them forward every step was reluctant and time seemed
to slow its pace so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it
down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge here the road gleaming faintly
passed over the stream in the midst of the valley and went on winding
deviously up towards the citys gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle
of the northward walls wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meads filled with
pale white flowers luminous these were too beautiful and yet horrible of
shape like the demented forms in an uneasy dream and they gave forth a faint
sickening charnel-smell an odour of rottenness filled the air from mead to
mead the bridge sprang figures stood there at its head carven with cunning in
forms human and bestial but all corrupt and loathsome the water flowing
beneath was silent and it steamed but the vapour that rose from it curling
and twisting about the bridge was deadly cold frodo felt his senses reeling
and his mind darkening then suddenly as if some force were at work other than
his own will he began to hurry tottering forward his groping hands held out
his head lolling from side to side both sam and gollum ran after him sam
caught his master in his arms as he stumbled and almost fell right on the
threshold of the bridge
not that way no not that way  whispered gollum but the breath between
his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle and he cowered to
the ground in terror
hold up mr frodo  muttered sam in frodos ear come back not that way
gollum says not and for once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city
on the hill the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire that
was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate at last with an effort
he turned back and as he did so he felt the ring resisting him dragging at
the chain about his neck and his eyes too as he looked away seemed for the
moment to have been blinded the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was already
vanishing into the gloom sam supporting and guiding his stumbling master
followed after him as quickly as he could not far from the near bank of the
stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road through this they
passed and sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at
first as the main road did until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it
faded and went dark winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the
valley
along this path the hobbits trudged side by side unable to see gollum in
front of them except when he turned back to beckon them on then his eyes shone
with a green-white light reflecting the noisome morgul-sheen perhaps or
kindled by some answering mood within of that deadly gleam and of the dark
eyeholes frodo and sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path slowly
they laboured on as they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous
stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer but now their limbs
were deadly tired as if they had walked all night under a burden or had been
swimming long against a heavy tide of water at last they could go no further
without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone they had now climbed up to the top of
a great hump of bare rock ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side and
round the head of this the path went on no more than a wide ledge with a chasm
on the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled
upwards until it disappeared into the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo its heavy on me sam lad very
heavy i wonder how far i can carry it anyway i must rest before we venture on
to that he pointed to the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh  hissed gollum hurrying back to them sssh  his fingers were
on his lips and he shook his head urgently tugging at frodos sleeve he
pointed towards the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not yet weariness and more than weariness oppressed
him it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body i must rest
he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again
hissing behind his hand as if to keep the sound from unseen listeners in the
air not here no not rest here fools eyes can see us when they come to the
bridge they will see us come away climb climb come 
come mr frodo said sam hes right again we cant stay here
all right said frodo in a remote voice as of one speaking half asleep i
will try wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late at that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath
them the great rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in the ground
and echoed in the mountains then with searing suddenness there came a great red
flash far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the
lowering clouds with crimson in that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
seemed unbearably violent and fierce peaks of stone and ridges like notched
knives sprang out in staring black against the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then came a great crack of thunder
and minas morgul answered there was a flare of livid lightnings: forks of
blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into the
sullen clouds the earth groaned and out of the city there came a cry mingled
with harsh high voices as of birds of prey and the shrill neighing of horses
wild with rage and fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly
to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing the hobbits wheeled round
towards it and cast themselves down holding their hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry ended falling back through a long sickening wail to
silence frodo slowly raised his head across the narrow valley now almost on a
level with his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and its cavernous gate
shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide and out of the
gate an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as the night against the wan walls and
the luminous pavement of the road frodo could see them small black figures in
rank upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless
stream before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like ordered
shadows and at their head was one greater than all the rest: a rider all
black save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered
with a perilous light now he was drawing near the bridge below and frodos
staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw surely there was the
lord of the nine riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle
here yes here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand had smitten down the
ring-bearer with his deadly knife the old wound throbbed with pain and a great
chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as with a
spell the rider halted suddenly right before the entrance of the bridge and
behind him all the host stood still there was a pause a dead silence maybe it
was the ring that called to the wraith-lord and for a moment he was troubled
sensing some other power within his valley this way and that turned the dark
head helmed and crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move and as he
waited he felt more urgent than ever before the command that he should put on
the ring but great as the pressure was he felt no inclination now to yield to
it he knew that the ring would only betray him and that he had not even if he
put it on the power to face the morgul-king-not yet there was no longer any
answer to that command in his own will dismayed by terror though it was and he
felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside it took his hand
and as frodo watched with his mind not willing it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old story far away it moved the hand inch by inch towards the
chain upon his neck then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand back
and set it to find another thing a thing lying hidden near his breast cold and
hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of galadriel so long
treasured and almost forgotten till that hour as he touched it for a while
all thought of the ring was banished from his mind he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode across
the bridge and all his dark host followed him maybe the elven-hoods defied his
unseen eyes and the mind of his small enemy being strengthened had turned
aside his thought but he was in haste already the hour had struck and at his
great masters bidding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down the winding road and
behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge so great an army had never
issued from that vale since the days of isildurs might no host so fell and
strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of anduin and yet it was but one and
not the greatest of the hosts that mordor now sent forth
frodo stirred and suddenly his heart went out to faramir the storm has
burst at last he thought this great array of spears and swords is going to
osgiliath will faramir get across in time he guessed it but did he know the
hour and who can now hold the fords when the king of the nine riders comes and
other armies will come i am too late all is lost i tarried on the way all is
lost even if my errand is performed no one will ever know there will be no
one i can tell it will be in vain overcome with weakness he wept and still
the host of morgul crossed the bridge
then at a great distance as if it came out of memories of the shire some
sunlit early morning when the day called and doors were opening he heard sams
voice speaking wake up mr frodo wake up  had the voice added: your
breakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised certainly sam was
urgent wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang the gates of minas morgul had closed the last rank
of spears had vanished down the road the tower still grinned across the valley
but the light was fading in it the whole city was falling back into a dark
brooding shade and silence yet still it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre gone and wed better go too theres something
still alive in that place something with eyes or a seeing mind if you take
me and the longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us come
on mr frodo 
frodo raised his head and then stood up despair had not left him but the
weakness had passed he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a moment
before he had felt the opposite that what he had to do he had to do if he
could and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf or
anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose he took his staff in one
hand and the phial in his other when he saw that the clear light was already
welling through his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his
heart then turning from the city of morgul now no more than a grey glimmer
across a dark gulf he prepared to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond
when the gates of minas morgul opened leaving the hobbits where they lay he
now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping foolish
silly  he hissed make haste they mustnt think danger has passed it
hasnt make haste 
they did not answer but they followed him on to the climbing ledge it was
little to the liking of either of them not even after facing so many other
perils but it did not last long soon the path reached a rounded angle where
the mountain-side swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a narrow
opening in the rock they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complete and they could see nothing much beyond their
hands stretch but gollums eyes shone pale several feet above as he turned
back towards them
careful  he whispered steps lots of steps must be careful 
care was certainly needed frodo and sam at first felt easier having now a
wall on either side but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder and as
they climbed up and up they became more and more aware of the long black fall
behind them and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous:
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some were broken and some cracked
as foot was set upon them the hobbits struggled on until at last they were
clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead and forcing their aching
knees to bend and straighten and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the
sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads
at length just as they felt that they could endure no more they saw
gollums eyes peering down at them again were up he whispered first
stairs past clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits just a few
more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following him crawled up the last step
and sat down rubbing their legs and knees they were in a deep dark passage that
seemed still to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let them rest long
theres another stair still he said much longer stair rest when we get
to the top of next stair not yet
sam groaned longer did you say  he asked
yes yess longer said gollum but not so difficult hobbits have climbed
the straight stair next comes the winding stair
and what after that  said sam
we shall see said gollum softly o yes we shall see 
i thought you said there was a tunnel said sam isnt there a tunnel or
something to go through 
o yes theres a tunnel said gollum but hobbits can rest before they try
that if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top very nearly if
they get through o yes 
frodo shivered the climb had made him sweat but now he felt cold and
clammy and there was a chill draught in the dark passage blowing down from the
invisible heights above he got up and shook himself well lets go on  he
said this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for miles and always the chill air flowed over
them rising as they went on to a bitter wind the mountains seemed to be trying
with their deadly breath to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets of
the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind they only knew
that they had come to the end when suddenly they felt no wall at their right
hand they could see very little great black shapeless masses and deep grey
shadows loomed above them and about them but now and again a dull red light
flickered up under the lowering clouds and for a moment they were aware of tall
peaks in front and on either side like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof
they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet on to a wide shelf a
cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right
gollum led the way close under the cliff for the present they were no longer
climbing but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark and
there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way their going was slow and
cautious how many hours had passed since they had entered the morgul vale
neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess the night seemed endless
at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up and once more a
stairway opened before them again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway did not delve into the
mountain-side here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path like a
snake wound to and fro across it at one point it crawled sideways right to the
edge of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit
the great ravine at the head of the morgul valley down in its depths glimmered
like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the dead city to the nameless pass
he turned hastily away
still on and up the stairway bent and crawled until at last with a final
flight short and straight it climbed out again on to another level the path
had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine and it now followed its
own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft
among the higher regions of the ephel dúath dimly the hobbits could
discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side between which
were great crevices and fissures blacker than the night where forgotten winters
had gnawed and carved the sunless stone and now the red light in the sky
seemed stronger though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they saw only the flame of
some great violence of sauron in the torment of gorgoroth beyond still far
ahead and still high above frodo looking up saw as he guessed the very
crown of this bitter road against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep-cloven between two black
shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively the horn upon the left was tall and
slender and in it burned a red light or else the red light in the land beyond
was shining through a hole he saw now: it was a black tower poised above the
outer pass he touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that  said sam so this secret way of yours is
guarded after all he growled turning to gollum as you knew all along i
suppose 
all ways are watched yes said gollum of course they are but hobbits
must try some way this may be least watched perhaps theyve all gone away to
big battle perhaps 
perhaps grunted sam well it still seems a long way off and a long way
up before we get there and theres still the tunnel i think you ought to rest
now mr frodo i dont know what time of day or night it is but weve kept
going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo let us find some corner out of the wind
and gather our strength-for the last lap for so he felt it to be the terrors
of the land beyond and the deed to be done there seemed remote too far off
yet to trouble him all his mind was bent on getting through or over this
impenetrable wall and guard if once he could do that impossible thing then
somehow the errand would be accomplished or so it seemed to him in that dark
hour of weariness still labouring in the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: frodo and
sam a little way within and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they
went down into the nameless land maybe the last meal they would ever eat
together some of the food of gondor they ate and wafers of the waybread of the
elves and they drank a little but of their water they were sparing and took
only enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water again  said sam but i suppose even over
there they drink orcs drink dont they 
yes they drink said frodo but do not let us speak of that such drink
is not for us
then all the more need to fill our bottles said sam but there isnt any
water up here: not a sound or a trickle have i heard and anyway faramir said we
were not to drink any water in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad morgul were his words said frodo we are
not in that valley now and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst theres a
wicked feeling about this place he sniffed and a smell i fancy do you
notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy i dont like it
i dont like anything here at all said frodo step or stone breath or
bone earth air and water all seem accursed but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it before we started but i suppose its often that way the brave
things in the old tales and songs mr frodo: adventures as i used to call
them i used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories
went out and looked for because they wanted them because they were exciting
and life was a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say but thats not the
way of it with the tales that really mattered or the ones that stay in the
mind folk seem to have been just landed in them usually - their paths were
laid that way as you put it but i expect they had lots of chances like us of
turning back only they didnt and if they had we shouldnt know because
theyd have been forgotten we hear about those as just went on - and not all to
a good end mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside
it call a good end you know coming home and finding things all right though
not quite the same - like old mr bilbo but those arent always the best tales
to hear though they may be the best tales to get landed in i wonder what sort
of a tale weve fallen into 
i wonder said frodo but i dont know and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that youre fond of you may know or guess what kind of a tale it
is happy-ending or sad-ending but the people in it dont know and you dont
want them to
no sir of course not beren now he never thought he was going to get that
silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet he did and that was a
worse place and a blacker danger than ours but thats
a long tale of course and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond
it - and the silmaril went on and came to eärendil and why sir i never
thought of that before weve got - youve got some of the light of it in that
star-glass that the lady gave you why to think of it were in the same
tale still its going on dont the great tales never end 
no they never end as tales said frodo but the people in them come and
go when their parts ended our part will end later - or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam he laughed grimly
and i mean just that mr frodo i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and
waking up to a mornings work in the garden im afraid thats all im hoping
for all the time all the big important plans are not for my sort still i
wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales were in one or course but
i mean: put into words you know told by the fireside or read out of a great
big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards and people will
say: "lets hear about frodo and the ring " and theyll say:
"yes thats one of my favourite stories frodo was very brave wasnt he
dad" "yes my boy the famousest of the hobbits and thats saying a
lot"
its saying a lot too much said frodo and he laughed a long clear laugh
from his heart such a sound had not been heard in those places since sauron
came to middle-earth to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were
listening and the tall rocks leaning over them but frodo did not heed them he
laughed again why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if
the story was already written but youve left out one of the chief characters:
samwise the stouthearted "i want to hear more about sam dad why didnt
they put in more of his talk dad thats what i like it makes me laugh and
frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he dad " 
now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun i was serious 
so was i said frodo and so i am were going on a bit too fast you and
i sam are still stuck in the worst places of the story and it is all too
likely that some will say at this point: "shut the book now dad we dont
want to read any more" 
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be one to say that things done and over
and made into part of the great tales are different why even gollum might be
good in a tale better than he is to have by you anyway and he used to like
tales himself once by his own account i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or
the villain
gollum he called would you like to be the hero - now wheres he got to
again
there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows
near he had refused their food though he had as usual accepted a mouthful of
water and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: they had supposed that one
at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day before had been to hunt
for food to his own liking and now he had evidently slipped off again while
they talked but what for this time
i dont like his sneaking off without saying said sam and least of all
now he cant be looking for food up here not unless theres some kind of rock
he fancies why there isnt even a bit of moss 
its no good worrying about him now said frodo we couldnt have got so
far not even within sight of the pass without him and so well have to put up
with his ways if hes false hes false
all the same id rather have him under my eye said sam all the more so
if hes false do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or
no and now we see a tower there - and it may be deserted and it may not do
you think hes gone to fetch them orcs or whatever they are
no i dont think so answered frodo even if hes up to some wickedness
and i suppose thats not unlikely i dont think its that: not to fetch orcs
or any servants of the enemy why wait till now and go through all the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he fears he could probably have
betrayed us to orcs many times since we met him no if its anything it will
be some little private trick of his own-that he thinks is quite secret
well i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam not that it comforts me
mightily i dont make no mistake: i dont doubt hed hand me over to
orcs as gladly as kiss his hand but i was forgetting - his precious no i
suppose the whole time its been the precious
for poor sméagol thats the one idea in all his little
schemes if he has any but how bringing us up here will help him in that is
more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo and i dont think hes got
just one plain scheme in his muddled head i think he really is in part trying
to save the precious from the enemy as long as he can for that would be the
last disaster for himself too if the enemy got it and in the other part
perhaps hes just biding his time and waiting on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before said sam but the nearer
they get to the enemys land the more like stinker slinker will get mark my
words: if ever we get to the pass he wont let us really take the precious
thing over the border without making some kind of trouble
we havent got there yet said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do if were caught
napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick not but what it would be
safe for you to have a wink now master safe if you lay close to me id be
dearly glad to see you have a sleep id keep watch over you and anyway if you
lay near with my arm round you no one could come pawing you without your sam
knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighed as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of
cool green yes even here i could sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he returned crawling and creeping
down the path out of the gloom ahead sam sat propped against the stone his
head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy in his lap lay frodos head
drowned deep in sleep upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands and
the other lay softly upon his masters breast peace was in both their faces
gollum looked at them a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim and grey old and tired a
spasm of pain seemed to twist him and he turned away peering back up towards
the pass shaking his head as if engaged in some interior debate then he came
back and slowly putting out a trembling hand very cautiously he touched
frodos knee - but almost the touch was a caress for a fleeting moment could
one of the sleepers have seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his
time beyond friends and kin and the fields and streams of youth an old
starved pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep and
immediately sam was wide awake the first thing he saw was gollum - pawing at
master as he thought
hey you he said roughly what are you up to
nothing nothing said gollum softly nice master
i daresay said sam but where have you been to - sneaking off and
sneaking back you old villain 
gollum withdrew himself and a green glint flickered under his heavy lids
almost spider-like he looked now crouched back on his bent limbs with his
protruding eyes the fleeting moment had passed beyond
recall sneaking sneaking he hissed hobbits always so polite yes o nice
hobbits sméagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he guides them and he searches for
paths and they say sneak sneak very nice friends o yes my
precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful sorry he said im
sorry but you startled me out of my sleep and i shouldnt have been sleeping
and that made me a bit sharp but mr frodo hes that tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is sorry but where have you been
to 
sneaking said gollum and the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way i dont suppose its so far
from the truth and now wed better all be sneaking along together whats the
time is it today or tomorrow 
its tomorrow said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to
sleep very foolish very dangerous-if poor sméagol wasnt sneaking
about to watch
i think we shall get tired of that word soon said sam but never mind
ill wake master up gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow and
bending down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up 
frodo stirred and opened his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bending over
him calling me early arent you sam he said its dark still 
yes its always dark here said sam but gollums come back mr frodo and
he says its tomorrow so we must be walking on the last lap
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up the last lap  he said hullo sméagol
found any food have you had any rest 
no food no rest nothing for sméagol said gollum hes a sneak
sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself sméagol said frodo its unwise
whether they are true or false
sméagol has to take whats given him answered gollum he was given
that name by kind master samwise the hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam yes sir he said i did use the word waking up out
of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand i said i was sorry but i
soon shant be
come let it pass then said frodo but now we seem to have come to the
point you and i sméagol tell me can we find the rest of the
way by ourselves were in sight of the pass of a way in and if we can find it
now then i suppose our agreement can be said to be over you have done what you
promised and youre free: free to go back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy and one day i may reward you i or those
that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined o no they cant find the way themselves
can they o no indeed theres the tunnel coming sméagol must go
on no rest no food not yet
 
it may indeed have been daytime now as gollum said but the hobbits could
see little difference unless perhaps the heavy sky above was less utterly
black more like a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness of deep
night which lingered still in cracks and holes a grey blurring shadow shrouded
the stony world about them they passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and
weathered rock standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand there was no
sound some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a great grey wall a last huge
upthrusting mass of mountain-stone darker it loomed and steadily it rose as
they approached until it towered up high above them shutting out the view of
all that lay beyond deep shadow lay before its feet sam sniffed the air
ugh that smell he said its getting stronger and stronger
presently they were under the shadow and there in the midst of it they saw
the opening of a cave this is the way in said gollum softly this is the
entrance to the tunnel he did not speak its name: torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of morgul
but a foul reek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark
within
is this the only way sméagol  said frodo
yes yes he answered yes we must go this way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said sam phew but
perhaps you dont mind bad smells
gollums eyes glinted he doesnt know what we minds does he precious no
he doesnt but sméagol can bear things yes hes been through o yes
right through its the only way
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam its like - well i wouldnt
like to say some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a hundred years
of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or no if its the only way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside in a few steps they were in utter
and impenetrable dark not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser there
there were airs moving and echoes and a sense of space here the air was
still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead they walked as it were in a black
vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that as it was breathed brought
blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind so that even the memory of
colours and of forms and of any light faded out of thought night always had
been and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feel and indeed the senses of their feet
and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully the walls felt to their
surprise smooth and the floor save for a step now and again was straight and
even going ever up at the same stiff slope the tunnel was high and wide so
wide that though the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side-walls with
their outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead while they
were still able to give heed to such things they could hear his breath hissing
and gasping just in front of them but after a time their senses became duller
both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on groping walking
on and on mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered will to
go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and distance soon passed out
of his reckoning sam on the right feeling the wall was aware that there was
an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less
heavy and then they passed it by
theres more than one passage here he whispered with an effort: it seemed
hard to make his breath give any sound its as orc-like a place as ever there
could be 
after that first he on the right and then frodo on the left passed three
or four such openings some wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt
of the main way for it was straight and did not turn and still went steadily
up but how long was it how much more of this would they have to endure or
could they endure the breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed
and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker
than the foul air as they thrust forward they felt things brush against their
heads or against their hands long tentacles or hanging growths perhaps: they
could not tell what they were and still the stench grew it grew until almost
it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them and that was
for their torment one hour two hours three hours: how many had they passed in
this lightless hole hours-days weeks rather sam left the tunnel-side and
shrank towards frodo and their hands met and clasped and so together they
still went on
at length frodo groping along the left-hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sideways into the emptiness here was some opening in the rock
far wider than any they had yet passed and out of it came a reek so foul and a
sense of lurking malice so intense that frodo reeled and at that moment sam
too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fear frodo gripped sams hand up 
he said in a hoarse breath without voice it all comes from here the stench
and the peril now for it quick 
calling up his remaining strength and resolution he dragged sam to his feet
and forced his own limbs to move sam stumbled beside him one step two steps
three steps-at last six steps maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen
opening but whether that was so or not suddenly it was easier to move as if
some hostile will for the moment had released them they struggled on still
hand in hand
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty the tunnel forked or so it
seemed and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way or which
kept nearer to the straight which should they take the left or the right
they knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice would almost certainly be
fatal
which way has gollum gone  panted sam and why didnt he wait 
sméagol  said frodo trying to call sméagol  but his
voice croaked and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips there was no
answer not an echo not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this time i fancy muttered sam i guess this is just
exactly where he meant to bring us gollum if ever i lay hands on you again
youll be sorry for it
presently groping and fumbling in the dark they found that the opening on
the left was blocked: either it was a blind or else some great stone had fallen
in the passage this cant be the way frodo whispered right or wrong we
must take the other
and quick  sam panted theres something worse than gollum about i can
feel something looking at us
they had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound
startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling bubbling noise
and a long venomous hiss they wheeled round but nothing could be seen still
as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword and
as he did so he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came i wish
old tom was near us now he thought then as he stood darkness about him and a
blackness of despair and anger in his heart it seemed to him that he saw a
light: a light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first as a sun-ray to
the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit then the light became colour:
green gold silver white far off as in a little picture drawn by
elven-fingers he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in lórien
and gifts were in her hands and you ring-bearer he heard her
say remote but clear for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creaking as of some great
jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark a reek came on before
it master master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his
voice the ladys gift the star-glass a light to you in dark places she said
it was to be the star-glass
the star-glass muttered frodo as one answering out of sleep hardly
comprehending why yes why had i forgotten it a light when all other
lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly he held aloft the phial of
galadriel for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star struggling in heavy
earthward mists and then as its power waxed and hope grew in frodos
mind it began to burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart of
dazzling light as though eärendil had himself come down from the high
sunset paths with the last silmaril upon his brow the darkness receded from it
until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long carried
not guessing its full worth and potency seldom had he remembered it on the
road until they came to morgul vale and never had he used it for fear of its
revealing light aiya eärendil elenion
ancalima he cried and knew not what he had spoken for it seemed
that another voice spoke through his clear untroubled by the foul air of the
pit
but other potencies there are in middle-earth powers of night and they are
old and strong and she that walked in the darkness had heard the elves cry that
cry far back in the deeps of time and she had not heeded it and it did not
daunt her now even as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent upon him and a
deadly regard considering him not far down the tunnel between them and the
opening where they had reeled and stumbled he was aware of eyes growing
visible two great clusters of many-windowed eyes - the coming menace was
unmasked at last the radiance of the star-glass was broken and thrown back from
their thousand facets but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily
to glow within a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil thought monstrous and
abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled with purpose and with hideous
delight gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam horror-stricken began slowly to back away their own gaze
held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes but as they backed so the eyes
advanced frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped then suddenly
released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain panic for the
amusement of the eyes they both turned and fled together but even as they ran
frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up
behind the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand  he cried desperately running is no use
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel  he called and gathering his courage he lifted up the phial
once more the eyes halted for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint
of doubt troubled them then frodos heart flamed within him and without
thinking what he did whether it was folly or despair or courage he took the
phial in his left hand and with his right hand drew his sword sting flashed
out and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light but at its edges a
blue fire flicked then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
they wavered doubt came into them as the light approached one by one they
dimmed and slowly they drew back no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted
them before from sun and moon and star they had been safe underground but now
a star had descended into the very earth still it approached and the eyes
began to quail one by one they all went dark they turned away and a great
bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its huge shadow in between they were
gone
master master cried sam he was close behind his own sword drawn and
ready stars and glory but the elves would make a song of that if ever they
heard of it and may i live to tell them and hear them sing but dont go on
master dont go down to that den nows our only chance now lets get out of
this foul hole
and so back they turned once more first walking and then running for as
they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply and with every stride they
climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair and strength returned to
limb and heart but still the hatred of the watcher lurked behind them blind
for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death and now there came a
flow of air to meet them cold and thin the opening the tunnels end at last
it was before them panting yearning for a roofless place they flung
themselves forward and then in amazement they staggered tumbling back the
outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of stone: soft and a little
yielding it seemed and yet strong and impervious air filtered through hut not
a glimmer of any light once more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness which
the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce and did not illuminate as if it
were a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissipate across the
width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun orderly as the web of some
huge spider but denser-woven and far greater and each thread was as thick as
rope
sam laughed grimly cobwebs  he said is that all cobwebs but what a
spider have at em down with em 
in a fury he hewed at them with his sword but the thread that he struck did
not break it gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring
turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm three times sam struck with
all his force and at last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the air one end of it lashed sams
hand and he cried out in pain starting back and drawing his hand across his
mouth
it will take days to clear the road like this he said whats to be done
have those eyes come back 
no not to be seen said frodo but i still feel that they are looking at
me or thinking about me: making some other plan perhaps if this light were
lowered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped in the end  said sam bitterly his anger rising again above
weariness and despair gnats in a net may the curse of faramir bite that
gollum and bite him quick 
that would not help us now said frodo come let us see what sting can
do it is an elven-blade there were webs of horror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star-glass do not be afraid hold it up and watch
then frodo stepped up to the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of close-strung
cords and at once springing away the blue-gleaming blade shore through them
like a scythe through grass and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose a
great rent was made
stroke after stroke he dealt until at last all the web within his reach was
shattered and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil in the
incoming wind the trap was broken
come  cried frodo on on  wild joy at their escape from the very mouth
of despair suddenly filled all his mind his head whirled as with a draught of
potent wine he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through the den
of night the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the last hours of a
sombre day were passing the red glare of mordor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope almost he
had reached the summit of the wall only a little higher now the cleft cirith
ungol was before him a dim notch in the black ridge and the horns of rock
darkling in the sky on either side a short race a sprinters course and he
would be through
the pass sam  he cried not heeding the shrillness of his voice that
released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild the
pass run run and well be through-through before any one can stop us 
sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs but glad as he was to
be free he was uneasy and as he ran he kept on glancing back at the dark arch
of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or some shape beyond his imagining spring
out in pursuit too little did he or his master know of the craft of shelob she
had many exits from her lair
there agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider-form even such as once
of old had lived in the land of the elves in the west that is now under the sea
such as beren fought in the mountains of terror in doriath and so came to lúthien
upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago how shelob
came there flying from ruin no tale tells for out of the dark years few tales
have come but still she was there who was there before sauron and before the
first stone of barad-dûr and she served none but herself drinking
the blood of elves and men bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her
feasts weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her food and her
vomit darkness far and wide her lesser broods bastards of the miserable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen to glen from the
ephel dúath to the eastern hills to dol guldur and the fastnesses of
mirkwood but none could rival her shelob the great last child of ungoliant to
trouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her sméagol who pried into
all dark holes and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her and the
darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off from light and from regret and he had promised to
bring her food but her lust was not his lust little she knew of or cared for
towers or rings or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired death
for all others mind and body and for herself a glut of life alone swollen
till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the darkness could not
contain her
but that desire was yet far away and long now had she been hungry lurking
in her den while the power of sauron grew and light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead and no elf or man came near
only the unhappy orcs poor food and wary but she must eat and however busily
they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever she
found some way to snare them but she lusted for sweeter meat and gollum had
brought it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when the evil mood was on
him as he walked the dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it may well be that when she
throws away the bones and the empty garments we shall find it we shall get it
the precious a reward for poor sméagol who brings nice food and well
save the precious as we promised o yes and when weve got it safe
then shell know it o yes then well pay her back my precious then well pay
everyone back 
so he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning which he still hoped to
hide from her even when he had come to her again and had bowed low before her
while his companions slept
and as for sauron: he knew where she lurked it pleased him that she should
dwell there hungry but unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised and orcs
they were useful slaves but he had them in plenty if now and again shelob
caught them to stay her appetite she was welcome: he could spare them and
sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat his cat he calls her
but she owns him not sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better uses
for: he would have them driven to her hole and report brought back to him of
the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own devices and feared no assault
nor wrath nor any end of their wickedness never yet had any fly escaped from
shelobs webs and the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did poor sam
know except that a fear was growing on him a menace which he could not see
and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him to run and his feet
seemed leaden
dread was round him and enemies before him in the pass and his master was
in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them turning his eyes away from the
shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
ahead and he saw two things that increased his dismay he saw that the sword
which frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue flame and he saw
that though the sky behind was now dark still the window in the tower was
glowing red
orcs  he muttered well never rush it like this theres orcs about and
worse than orcs then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy he closed
his hand about the precious phial which he still bore red with his own living
blood his hand shone for a moment and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven-cloak about him now he tried
to quicken his pace his master was gaining on him already he was some twenty
strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he would be lost to sight in that
grey world
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came a little way
ahead and to his left he saw suddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under
the cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld horrible beyond the
horror of an evil dream most like a spider she was but huger than the great
hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her
remorseless eyes those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated
there they were lit with a fell light again clustering in her out-thrust head
great horns she had and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen
body a vast bloated bag swaying and sagging between her legs its great bulk
was black blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath was pale and
luminous and gave forth a stench her legs were bent with great knobbed joints
high above her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines and at each
legs end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out
of the upper exit from her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running on
her creaking legs now making a sudden bound she was between sam and his
master either she did not see sam or she avoided him for the moment as the
bearer of the light and fixed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of his phial running heedless up the path unaware yet of his peril swiftly he
ran but shelob was swifter in a few leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout look out behind
 he yelled look out master im - but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck
while something wrapped itself about his leg taken off his guard he toppled
backwards into the arms of his attacker
got him  hissed gollum in his ear at last my precious weve got him
yes the nassty hobbit we takes this one shell
get the other o yes shelob will get him not sméagol: he promised he
wont hurt master at all but hes got you you nassty filthy little
sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the delay when his master was in
deadly peril gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond
anything that gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he thought
him not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely his
hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked and lunged forward again trying to
tear away from the grip on his neck his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs staff desperately he tried to
turn and stab his enemy but gollum was too quick his long right arm shot out
and he grabbed sams wrist: his fingers were like a vice slowly and
relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward till with a cry of pain sam
released the sword and it fell to the ground and all the while gollums other
hand was tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick with all his strength he pulled away and got
his feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and
with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum fell over with sam on
top and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach a sharp
hiss came out of him and for a second his hand upon sams throat loosened but
his fingers still gripped the sword-hand sam tore himself forward and away and
stood up and then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on the wrist
held by gollum laying hold of the staff with his left hand sam swung it up
and down it came with a whistling crack on gollums outstretched arm just below
the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go then sam waded in not waiting to change the
staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow quick as a snake gollum
slithered aside and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back the
staff cracked and broke that was enough for him grabbing from behind was an
old game of his and seldom had he failed in it but this time misled by spite
he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his
victims neck everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness and now he was face
to face with a furious enemy little less than his own size this fight was not
for him sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it gollum squealed
and springing aside on to all fours he jumped away in one big bound like a
frog before sam could reach him he was off running with amazing speed back
towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him for the moment he had forgotten everything
else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill gollum but before he
could overtake him gollum was gone then as the dark hole stood before him and
the stench came out to meet him like a clap of thunder the thought of frodo and
the monster smote upon sams mind he spun round and rushed wildly up the path
calling and calling his masters name he was too late so far gollums plot had
succeeded
 
frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over
him so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of sam and his cries until
he was close at hand as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already bound in
cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder and the monster with her great
forelegs was beginning half to lift half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the ground his elven-blade where
it had fallen useless from his grasp sam did not wait to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage he sprang forward
with a yell and seized his masters sword in his left hand then he charged no
onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts where some
desperate small creature armed with little teeth alone will spring upon a tower
of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned
slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him but almost before she was
aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw sam sprang
in inside the arches of her legs and with a quick upthrust of his other hand
stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature was right under her for the moment out of the
reach of her sting and of her claws her vast belly was above him with its
putrid light and the stench of it almost smote him down still his fury held
for one more blow and before she could sink upon him smothering him and all
his little impudence of courage he slashed the bright elven-blade across her
with desperate strength
but shelob was not as dragons are no softer spot had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide but ever thickened from
within with layer on layer of evil growth the blade scored it with a dreadful
gash but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men not
though elf or dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of beren or of túrin
wield it she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the great bag of her
belly high above sams head poison frothed and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again too soon for
sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his own sword with both hands he
held the elven-blade point upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so
shelob with the driving force of her own cruel will with strength greater than
any warriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike deep deep it pricked
as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of knowing in all her long
world of wickedness not the doughtiest soldier of old gondor nor the most
savage orc entrapped had ever thus endured her or set blade to her beloved
flesh a shudder went through her heaving up again wrenching away from the
pain she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a
convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos head his senses reeling in the foul
stench his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword through the mist
before his eyes he was aware dimly of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to
master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him slowly he
raised his head and saw her only a few paces away eyeing him her beak
drabbling a spittle of venom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded
eye there she crouched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground the great
bows of her legs quivering as she gathered herself for another spring-this time
to crush and sting to death: no little bite of poison to still the struggling of
her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even as sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his death in her eyes a
thought came to him as if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in his
breast with his left hand and found what he sought: cold and hard and solid it
seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel  he said faintly and then he heard voices far off but clear:
the crying of the elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of
the shire and the music of the elves as it came through his sleep in the hall
of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth
and then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did
not know:
a elbereth gilthoniel

o menel palan-diriel

le nallon sí dinguruthos

a tiro nin fanuilos
and with that he staggered to his feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts
son again
now come you filth he cried youve hurt my master you brute and
youll pay for it were going on but well settle with you first come on and
taste it again
as if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a white torch in his hand it flamed like a star that leaping from
the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light no such terror out of
heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before the beams of it entered into her
wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light spread from eye to eye she fell back beating the air with her forelegs
her sight blasted by inner lightnings her mind in agony then turning her
maimed head away she rolled aside and began to crawl claw by claw towards the
opening in the dark cliff behind
sam came on he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on and shelob
cowed at last shrunken in defeat jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten
from him she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail of
green-yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed a last stroke at her
dragging legs then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her lair nursing her malice and
her misery and in slow years of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding
her clustered eyes until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreadful
snares in the glens of the mountains of shadow this tale does not tell
sam was left alone wearily as the evening of the nameless land fell upon
the place of battle he crawled back to his master
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak as he had run
forward eager rejoicing to be free shelob with hideous speed had come behind
and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck he lay now pale and heard
no voice and did not move
master dear master  said sam and through a long silence waited
listening in vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head
upon frodos breast and to his mouth but no stir of life could he find nor
feel the faintest flutter of the heart often he chafed his masters hands and
feet and touched his brow but all were cold
frodo mr frodo  he called dont leave me here alone its your sam
calling dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo o wake up frodo me
dear me dear wake up
then anger surged over hint and he ran about his masters body in a rage
stabbing the air and smiting the stones and shouting challenges presently he
came back and bending looked at frodos face pale
beneath him in the dusk and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was
revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel in lórien: frodo with a pale
face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff or fast asleep he had thought
then hes dead  he said not asleep dead  and as he said it as
if the words had set the venom to its work again it seemed to him that the hue
of the face grew livid green
and then black despair came down on him and sam bowed to the ground and
drew his grey hood over his head and night came into his heart and he knew no
more
when at last the blackness passed sam looked up and shadows were about him
but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he could not
tell he was still in the same place and still his master lay beside him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do  he said did i come all this way with
him for nothing  and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at
the time he did not understand himself at the beginning of their journey: i
have something to do before the end i must see it through sir if you
understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead unburied on the top of the
mountains and go home or go on go on he repeated and for a moment doubt
and fear shook him go on is that what ive got to do and leave him
then at last he began to weep and going to frodo he composed his body and
folded his cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about him and he
laid his own sword at one side and the staff that faramir had given at the
other
if im to go on he said then i must take your sword by your leave mr
frodo but ill put this one to lie by you as it lay by the old king in the
barrow and youve got your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo and your
star-glass mr frodo you did lend it to me and ill need it for ill be
always in the dark now its too good for me and the lady gave it to you but
maybe shed understand do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet he knelt and held frodos hand and could not
release it and time went by and still he knelt holding his masters hand and
in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely journey
- for vengeance if once he could go his anger would bear him down all the
roads of the world pursuing until he had him at last: gollum then gollum
would die in a corner but that was not what he had set out to do it would not
be worth while to leave his master for that it would not bring him back
nothing would they had better both be dead together and that too would be a
lonely journey
he looked on the bright point of the sword he thought of the places behind
where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness there was no
escape that way that was to do nothing not even to grieve that was not what
he had set out to do what am i to do then  he cried again and now he seemed
plainly to know the hard answer: see it through another lonely journey
and the worst
what me alone go to the crack of doom and all  he quailed still but
the resolve grew what me take the ring from him the council
gave it to him
but the answer came at once: and the council gave him companions so that
the errand should not fail and you are the last of all the company the errand
must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned i wish old gandalf was hare or
somebody why am i left all alone to make up my mind im sure to go wrong and
its not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yourself forward youve been put forward and as for
not being the right and proper person why mr frodo wasnt as you might say
nor mr bilbo they didnt choose themselves
ah well i must make up my own mind i will make it up but ill be sure to
go wrong: thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now: if were found here or mr frodos found and that things
on him well the enemy will get it and thats the end of all of us of lorien
and rivendell and the shire and all and there s no time to lose or itll be
the end anyway the wars begun and more than likely things are all going the
enemys way already no chance to go back with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me over masters body and gets it: or
take it and go he drew a deep breath then take it it is 
he stooped very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand
inside frodos tunic then with his other hand raising the head he kissed the
cold forehead and softly drew the chain over it and then the head lay quietly
back again in rest no change came over the still face and by that more than by
all other tokens sam was convinced at last that frodo had died and laid aside
the quest
good-bye master my dear  he murmured forgive your sam hell come back
to this spot when the jobs done - if he manages it and then hell not leave
you again rest you quiet till i come and may no foul creature come anigh you
and if the lady could hear me and give me one wish i would wish to come back
and find you again good-bye 
and then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it and at once his head
was bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring as if a great stone had
been strung on him but slowly as if the weight became less or new strength
grew in him he raised his head and then with a great effort got to his feet
and found that he could walk and bear his burden and for a moment he lifted up
the phial and looked down at his master and the light burned gently now with
the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer and in that light frodos face
was fair of hue again pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty as of one who
has long passed the shadows and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark
he had not far to go the tunnel was some way behind the cleft a couple of
hundred yards ahead or less the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut worn
in ages of passage running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either
side the trough narrowed rapidly soon sam came to a long flight of broad
shallow steps now the orc-tower was right above him frowning black and in it
the red eye glowed now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it he was coming
to the top of the steps and was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself but he had not though he
had done his best to think it out what he was doing was altogether against the
grain of his nature have i got it wrong  he muttered what ought i to have
done 
as the sheer sides of the cleft closed about him before he reached the
actual summit before he looked at last on the path descending into the nameless
land he turned for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the gathering gloom the mouth of the
tunnel and he thought he could see or guess where frodo lay he fancied there
was a glimmer on the ground down there or perhaps it was some trick of his
tears as he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen
in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish he sighed to go back and find
him  then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps: the
heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few more and he would be going down and
would never see that high place again and then suddenly he heard cries and
voices he stood still as stone orc-voices they were behind him and before
him a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: orcs were coming up to the cleft
from the far side from some entry to the tower perhaps tramping feet and
shouts behind he wheeled round he saw small red lights torches winking away
below there as they issued from the tunnel at last the hunt was up the red eye
of the tower had not been blind he was caught
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was very
near in a minute they would reach the top and be on him he had taken too long
in making up his mind and now it was no good how could he escape or save
himself or save the ring the ring he was not aware of any thought or
decision he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the ring in
his hand the head of the orc-company appeared in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was filled with an hour of
thought at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed
but otherwise than in shelobs lair all things about him now were not dark but
vague while he himself was there in a grey hazy world alone like a small
black solid rock and the ring weighing down his left hand was like an orb of
hot gold he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and uniquely visible
and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him
he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of water far off in morgul vale
and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices in the dungeons of the tower and the cries of
the orcs as they came out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears the
crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him he shrank
against the cliff but they marched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands and they
passed him by he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide
he listened the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had
sighted one another and both parties were now hurrying and shouting he heard
them both clearly and he understood what they said perhaps the ring gave
understanding of tongues or simply understanding especially of the servants of
sauron its maker so that if he gave heed he understood and translated the
thought to himself certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it
approached the places of its forging but one thing it did not confer and that
was courage at present sam still thought only of hiding of lying low till all
was quiet again and he listened anxiously he could not tell how near the
voices were the words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough of war already 
orders you lubber and what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down to fight 
orders to you im in command of this pass so speak civil whats your
report 
nothing
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders the orcs
lower down had suddenly seen something they began to run so did the others
hai hola heres something lying right in the road a spy a spy  there
was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood they had seen
his master what would they do he had heard tales of the orcs to make the blood
run cold it could not be borne he sprang up he flung the quest and all his
decisions away and fear and doubt with them he knew now where his place was
and had been: at his masters side though what he could do there was not clear
back he ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
how many are there he thought thirty or forty from the tower at least
and a lot more than that from down below i guess how many can i kill before
they get me theyll see the flame of the sword as soon as i draw it and
theyll get me sooner or later i wonder if any song will ever mention it: how
samwise fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodies round his master no no
song of course not for the ringll be found and therell be no more songs i
cant help it my place is by mr frodo they must understand that - elrond and
the council and the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom their plans
have gone wrong i cant be their ring-bearer not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now he had had no time to consider
himself but now he realized that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion: his
legs would not carry him as he wished he was too slow the path seemed miles
long where had they all got to in the mist
there they were again a good way ahead still a cluster of figures round
something lying on the ground a few seemed to be darting this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail he tried to make a spurt
come on sam  he said or youll be too late again he loosened the
sword in its sheath in a minute he would draw it and then-
there was a wild clamour hooting and laughing as something was lifted from
the ground ya hoi ya harri hoi up up 
then a voice shouted: now off the quick way back to the undergate shell
not trouble us tonight by all the signs the whole band of orc-figures began to
move four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders ya hoi

they had taken frodos body they were off he could not catch them up still
he laboured on the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in those with the
burden went first and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and
jostling sam came on he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his wavering
hand but they did not see it even as he came panting up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast then he drew his sleeve
across his face wiping away the grime and sweat and tears curse the filth
 he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel rather it was as if he
had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog his weariness was growing but
his will hardened all the more he thought he could see the light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up orcs go fast
in tunnels and this tunnel they knew well for in spite of shelob they were
forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the
mountains in what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been
made where shelob had taken up her abode in ages past they did not know: but
many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side so as to escape
the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters tonight
they did not intend to go far down but were hastening to find a side-passage
that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff must of them were gleeful
delighted with what they had found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and
yammered after the fashion of their kind sam heard the noise of their harsh
voices flat and hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two voices from
among all the rest: they were louder and nearer to him the captains of the two
parties seemed to be bringing up the rear debating as they went
cant you stop your rabble making such a racket shagrat  grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half the noise said the other
but let the lads play no need to worry about shelob for a bit i reckon shes
sat on a nail it seems and we shant cry about that didnt you see: a nasty
mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers
if weve stopped it once weve stopped it a hundred times so let em laugh
and weve struck a bit of luck at last: got something that lugbúrz
wants
lugbúrz wants it eh what is it dyou think elvish it looked
to me but undersized whats the danger in a thing like that 
dont know till weve had a look
oho so they havent told you what to expect they dont tell us all they
know do they not by half but they can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that even with his strangely
sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said they may but
theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some among my lot as like as not but
theres no doubt about it theyre troubled about
something the nazgûl down below are by your account and lugbúrz
is too something nearly slipped
nearly you say  said gorbag
all right said shagrat but well talk of that later: wait till we get to
the under-way theres a place there where we can talk a bit while the lads go
on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear then there was a rumbling
noise and just as he hurried up a bump as far as he could guess the orcs had
turned and gone into the very opening which frodo and he had tried and found
blocked it was still blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way but the orcs had got through
somehow for he could hear their voices on the other side they were still
running along deeper and deeper into the mountain back towards the tower sam
felt desperate they were carrying off his masters body for some foul purpose
and he could not follow he thrust and pushed at the block and he threw himself
against it but it did not yield then not far inside or so he thought he
heard the two captains voices talking again he stood still listening for a
little hoping perhaps to learn something useful perhaps gorbag who seemed to
belong to minas morgul would come out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice the
messages go through quicker than anything could fly as a rule but i dont
enquire how its done safest not to grr those nazgûl give me the
creeps and they skin the body off you as soon as look at you and leave you
all cold in the dark on the other side but he likes em theyre his favourites
nowadays so its no use grumbling i tell you its no game serving down in the
city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagrat
id like to try somewhere where theres none of em but the wars on now
and when thats over things may be easier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag well see but anyway if it does go well
there should be a lot more room what dyou say - if we get a chance you and
mell slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads somewhere
where theres good loot nice and handy and no big bosses
ah  said shagrat like old times
yes said gorbag but dont count on it im not easy in my mind as i
said the big bosses ay his voice sank almost to a whisper ay even the
biggest can make mistakes something nearly slipped you say i say something has
slipped and weve got to look out always the poor uruks to put slips right
and small thanks but dont forget: the enemies dont love us any more than they
love him and if they get topsides on him were done too but see here: when
were you ordered out 
about an hour ago just before you saw us a message came: nazgûl
uneasy spies feared on stairs double vigilance patrol to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business said gorbag see here - our silent watchers were uneasy more
than two days ago that i know but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day
nor any message sent to lugbúrz either: owing to the great signal going
up and the high nazgûl going off to the war and all that and then they
couldnt get lugbúrz to pay attention for a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat big things going on
away west they say
i daresay growled gorbag but in the meantime enemies have got up the
stairs and what were you up to youre supposed to keep watch arent you
special orders or no what are you for
thats enough dont try and teach me my job we were awake all right we
knew there were funny things going on
very funny 
yes very funny: lights and shouting and all but shelob was on the go my
lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak whats that 
you must have seen him: little thin black fellow like a spider himself or
perhaps more like a starved frog hes been here before came out
of lugbúrz the first time years ago and we had word from high up to let
him pass hes been up the stairs once or twice since then but weve
left him alone: seems to have some understanding with her ladyship i suppose
hes no good to eat: she wouldnt worry about words from high up but a fine
guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket early
last night we saw him anyway my lads reported that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemed good enough for me until the message came i thought her
sneak had brought her a toy or that youd perhaps sent her a present a
prisoner of war or something i dont interfere when shes playing nothing gets
by shelob when shes on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyes back there i tell you im not
easy in my mind whatever came up the stairs did get by it cut her web
and got clean out of the hole thats something to think about 
ah well but she got him in the end didnt she 
got him got who this little fellow but if he was the only
one then shed have had him off to her larder long before and there hed be
now and if lugbúrz wanted him youd
have to go and get him nice for you but there was more than one
at this point sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear
against the stone
who cut the cords shed put round him shagrat same one as cut the web
didnt you see that and who stuck a pin into her ladyship same one i reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat 
shagrat made no reply
you may well put your thinking cap on if youve got one its no laughing
matter no one no one has ever stuck a pin in shelob before as you should know
well enough theres no grief in that but think-theres someone loose
hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked
since the bad old times since the great siege something has slipped
and what is it then  growled shagrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say theres a large warrior loose
elf most likely with an elf-sword anyway and an axe as well maybe: and hes
loose in your bounds too and youve never spotted him very funny indeed 
gorbag spat sam smiled grimly at this description of himself
ah well you always did take a gloomy view said shagrat you can read the
signs how you like but there may be other ways to explain them anyhow ive
got watchers at every point and im going to deal with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we have caught then ill begin to
worry about something else
its my guess you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag he
may have had nothing to do with the real mischief the big fellow with the sharp
sword doesnt seem to have thought him worth much anyhow - just left him lying:
regular elvish trick
well see come on now weve talked enough lets go and have a look at the
prisoner
what are you going to do with him dont forget i spotted him first if
theres any game me and my lads must be in it
now now growled shagrat i have my orders and its more than my bellys
worth or yours to break em any trespasser found
by the guard is to be held at the tower prisoner is to be stripped full
description of every article garment weapon letter ring or trinket is to be
sent to lugbúrz at once and to lugbúrz only and
the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact under pain of death for every member
of the guard until he sends or comes himself thats plain enough and thats
what im going to do
stripped eh  said gorbag what teeth nails hair and all 
no none of that hes for lugbúrz i tell you hes wanted
safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag hes nothing but carrion now
what lugbúrz will do with such stuff i cant guess he might as well go
in the pot
you fool snarled shagrat youve been talking very clever but theres a
lot you dont know though most other folk do youll be for the pot or for
shelob if you dont take care carrion is that all you know of her ladyship
when she binds with cords shes after meat she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck
cold blood this fellow isnt dead 
sam reeled clutching at the stone he felt as if the whole dark world was
turning upside down so great was the shock that he almost swooned but even as
he fought to keep a hold on his senses deep inside him he was aware of the
comment: you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it dont trust your
head samwise it is not the best part of you the trouble with you is that you
never really had any hope now what is to be done  fur the moment nothing but
to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen listen to the vile
orc-voices
garn said shagrat shes got more than one poison when shes hunting
she just gives em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned fish and then
she has her way with them dyou remember old ufthak we lost him for days then
we found him in a corner hanging up he was but he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him maybe but we didnt touch him-no good
interfering with her nar - this little filth hell
wake up in a few hours and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit hell be all
right or would be if lugbúrz would let him alone and of course beyond
wondering where he is and whats happened to him
and whats going to happen to him laughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate if we cant do anything else i
dont suppose hes ever been in lovely lugbúrz so he may like to know
what to expect this is going to be more funny than i thought lets go
theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat and hes got to be
kept safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i were you id catch the big one thats loose before you
send in any report to lugbúrz it wont sound too pretty to say youve
caught the kitten and let the cat escape
the voices began to move away sam heard the sound of feet receding he was
recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him i got it all wrong
 he cried i knew i would now theyve got him the devils the filth never
leave your master never never: that was my right rule and i knew it in my
heart may i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him somehow somehow 
he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt but it only gave
out a dull sound the sword however blazed so brightly now that he could see
dimly in its light to his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped
like a heavy door and was less than twice his own height above it was a dark
blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening it was probably
only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of shelob fastened on the inside
with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning with his remaining
strength sam leaped and caught the top scrambled up and dropped and then he
ran madly sword blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond
thought of weariness he could not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catching the two orcs up:
their voices were growing nearer again now they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat in angry tones put him right up
in the top chamber
what for  growled gorbag havent you any lock-ups down below 
hes going out of harms way i tell you answered shagrat see hes
precious i dont trust all my lads and none of yours nor you neither when
youre mad for fun hes going where i want him and where you wont come if
you dont keep civil up to the top i say hell be safe there
will he said sam youre forgetting the great big elvish warrior thats
loose and with that he raced round the last corner only to find that by some
trick of the tunnel or of the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged
the distance
the two orc-figures were still some way ahead he could see them now black
and squat against a red glare the passage ran straight at last up an incline
and at the end wide open were great double doors leading probably to deep
chambers far below the high horn of the tower already the orcs with their
burden had passed inside gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns and banging of gongs a
hideous clamour gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yelled and brandished sting but his little voice was drowned in the
tumult no one heeded him
the great doors slammed to boom the bars of iron fell into place inside
clang the gate was shut sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates
and fell senseless to the ground he was out in the darkness frodo was alive
but taken by the enemy
here ends the second part of the history of the war of the ring
